So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.\\n\\nI give Pirrip as my father’s family name, on the authority of his\\ntombstone and my sister,—Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.\\nAs I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of\\neither of them (for their days were long before the days of\\nphotographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were\\nunreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on\\nmy father’s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,\\nwith curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,\\n“_Also Georgiana Wife of the Above_,” I drew a childish conclusion that\\nmy mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each\\nabout a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside\\ntheir grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of\\nmine,—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that\\nuniversal struggle,—I am indebted for a belief I religiously\\nentertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands\\nin their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state\\nof existence.\\n\\nOurs was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river\\nwound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad\\nimpression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on\\na memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out\\nfor certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the\\nchurchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also\\nGeorgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander,\\nBartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the\\naforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness\\nbeyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates,\\nwith scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low\\nleaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from\\nwhich the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of\\nshivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.\\n\\n“Hold your noise!” cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from\\namong the graves at the side of the church porch. “Keep still, you\\nlittle devil, or I’ll cut your throat!”\\n\\nA fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man\\nwith no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his\\nhead. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and\\nlamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by\\nbriars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose\\nteeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.\\n\\n“Oh! Don’t cut my throat, sir,” I pleaded in terror. “Pray don’t do it,\\nsir.”\\n\\n“Tell us your name!” said the man. “Quick!”\\n\\n“Pip, sir.”\\n\\n“Once more,” said the man, staring at me. “Give it mouth!”\\n\\n“Pip. Pip, sir.”\\n\\n“Show us where you live,” said the man. “Pint out the place!”\\n\\nI pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the\\nalder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.\\n\\nThe man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and\\nemptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.\\nWhen the church came to itself,—for he was so sudden and strong that he\\nmade it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my\\nfeet,—when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high\\ntombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“You young dog,” said the man, licking his lips, “what fat cheeks you\\nha’ got.”\\n\\nI believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my\\nyears, and not strong.\\n\\n“Darn me if I couldn’t eat ’em,” said the man, with a threatening shake\\nof his head, “and if I han’t half a mind to’t!”\\n\\nI earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn’t, and held tighter to the\\ntombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;\\npartly, to keep myself from crying.\\n\\n“Now lookee here!” said the man. “Where’s your mother?”\\n\\n“There, sir!” said I.\\n\\nHe started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.\\n\\n“There, sir!” I timidly explained. “Also Georgiana. That’s my mother.”\\n\\n“Oh!” said he, coming back. “And is that your father alonger your\\nmother?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said I; “him too; late of this parish.”\\n\\n“Ha!” he muttered then, considering. “Who d’ye live with,—supposin’\\nyou’re kindly let to live, which I han’t made up my mind about?”\\n\\n“My sister, sir,—Mrs. Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,\\nsir.”\\n\\n“Blacksmith, eh?” said he. And looked down at his leg.\\n\\nAfter darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer to\\nmy tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he\\ncould hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,\\nand mine looked most helplessly up into his.\\n\\n“Now lookee here,” he said, “the question being whether you’re to be\\nlet to live. You know what a file is?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“And you know what wittles is?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\nAfter each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a\\ngreater sense of helplessness and danger.\\n\\n“You get me a file.” He tilted me again. “And you get me wittles.” He\\ntilted me again. “You bring ’em both to me.” He tilted me again. “Or\\nI’ll have your heart and liver out.” He tilted me again.\\n\\nI was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both\\nhands, and said, “If you would kindly please to let me keep upright,\\nsir, perhaps I shouldn’t be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.”\\n\\nHe gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped\\nover its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright\\nposition on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:—\\n\\n“You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You\\nbring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and\\nyou never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your\\nhaving seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall\\nbe let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no\\nmatter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore\\nout, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain’t alone, as you may think I am.\\nThere’s a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I\\nam a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak. That young man has\\na secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his\\nheart, and at his liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide\\nhimself from that young man. A boy may lock his door, may be warm in\\nbed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think\\nhimself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and\\ncreep his way to him and tear him open. I am a keeping that young man\\nfrom harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. I\\nfind it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, what\\ndo you say?”\\n\\nI said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken\\nbits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in\\nthe morning.\\n\\n“Say Lord strike you dead if you don’t!” said the man.\\n\\nI said so, and he took me down.\\n\\n“Now,” he pursued, “you remember what you’ve undertook, and you\\nremember that young man, and you get home!”\\n\\n“Goo-good night, sir,” I faltered.\\n\\n“Much of that!” said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. “I\\nwish I was a frog. Or a eel!”\\n\\nAt the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his\\narms,—clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,—and limped\\ntowards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the\\nnettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked\\nin my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,\\nstretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his\\nankle and pull him in.\\n\\nWhen he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose\\nlegs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When\\nI saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of\\nmy legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on\\nagain towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and\\npicking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into\\nthe marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were\\nheavy or the tide was in.\\n\\nThe marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped\\nto look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not\\nnearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long\\nangry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the\\nriver I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the\\nprospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the\\nbeacon by which the sailors steered,—like an unhooped cask upon a\\npole,—an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with\\nsome chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was\\nlimping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life,\\nand come down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a\\nterrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their\\nheads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I\\nlooked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of\\nhim. But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter II.\\n\\n\\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,\\nand had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours\\nbecause she had brought me up “by hand.” Having at that time to find\\nout for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a\\nhard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her\\nhusband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both\\nbrought up by hand.\\n\\nShe was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general\\nimpression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe\\nwas a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth\\nface, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to\\nhave somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild,\\ngood-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,—a sort\\nof Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.\\n\\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing\\nredness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible\\nshe washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall\\nand bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her\\nfigure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in\\nfront, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful\\nmerit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this\\napron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn\\nit at all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken\\nit off, every day of her life.\\n\\nJoe’s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of\\nthe dwellings in our country were,—most of them, at that time. When I\\nran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was\\nsitting alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and\\nhaving confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment\\nI raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,\\nsitting in the chimney corner.\\n\\n“Mrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she’s\\nout now, making it a baker’s dozen.”\\n\\n“Is she?”\\n\\n“Yes, Pip,” said Joe; “and what’s worse, she’s got Tickler with her.”\\n\\nAt this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat\\nround and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler\\nwas a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled\\nframe.\\n\\n“She sot down,” said Joe, “and she got up, and she made a grab at\\nTickler, and she Ram-paged out. That’s what she did,” said Joe, slowly\\nclearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at\\nit; “she Ram-paged out, Pip.”\\n\\n“Has she been gone long, Joe?” I always treated him as a larger species\\nof child, and as no more than my equal.\\n\\n“Well,” said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, “she’s been on the\\nRam-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She’s a-coming! Get\\nbehind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.”\\n\\nI took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,\\nand finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause,\\nand applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by\\nthrowing me—I often served as a connubial missile—at Joe, who, glad to\\nget hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly\\nfenced me up there with his great leg.\\n\\n“Where have you been, you young monkey?” said Mrs. Joe, stamping her\\nfoot. “Tell me directly what you’ve been doing to wear me away with\\nfret and fright and worrit, or I’d have you out of that corner if you\\nwas fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.”\\n\\n“I have only been to the churchyard,” said I, from my stool, crying and\\nrubbing myself.\\n\\n“Churchyard!” repeated my sister. “If it warn’t for me you’d have been\\nto the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by\\nhand?”\\n\\n“You did,” said I.\\n\\n“And why did I do it, I should like to know?” exclaimed my sister.\\n\\nI whimpered, “I don’t know.”\\n\\n“_I_ don’t!” said my sister. “I’d never do it again! I know that. I may\\ntruly say I’ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were.\\nIt’s bad enough to be a blacksmith’s wife (and him a Gargery) without\\nbeing your mother.”\\n\\nMy thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at\\nthe fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the\\nmysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was\\nunder to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me\\nin the avenging coals.\\n\\n“Hah!” said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. “Churchyard,\\nindeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.” One of us, by the by,\\nhad not said it at all. “You’ll drive _me_ to the churchyard betwixt\\nyou, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you’d be without\\nme!”\\n\\nAs she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me\\nover his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and\\ncalculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the\\ngrievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his\\nright-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with\\nhis blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.\\n\\nMy sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,\\nthat never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard\\nand fast against her bib,—where it sometimes got a pin into it, and\\nsometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she\\ntook some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf,\\nin an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,—using\\nboth sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and\\nmoulding the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a\\nfinal smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very\\nthick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the\\nloaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.\\n\\nOn the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.\\nI felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful\\nacquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew\\nMrs. Joe’s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my\\nlarcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.\\nTherefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of\\nmy trousers.\\n\\nThe effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I\\nfound to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap\\nfrom the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.\\nAnd it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In our\\nalready-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his\\ngood-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare\\nthe way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each\\nother’s admiration now and then,—which stimulated us to new exertions.\\nTo-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast\\ndiminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he\\nfound me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my\\nuntouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately\\nconsidered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had\\nbest be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the\\ncircumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at\\nme, and got my bread and butter down my leg.\\n\\nJoe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss\\nof appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he\\ndidn’t seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than\\nusual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like\\na pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on\\none side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw\\nthat my bread and butter was gone.\\n\\nThe wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of\\nhis bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister’s\\nobservation.\\n\\n“What’s the matter _now_?” said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.\\n\\n“I say, you know!” muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious\\nremonstrance. “Pip, old chap! You’ll do yourself a mischief. It’ll\\nstick somewhere. You can’t have chawed it, Pip.”\\n\\n“What’s the matter now?” repeated my sister, more sharply than before.\\n\\n“If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I’d recommend you to do\\nit,” said Joe, all aghast. “Manners is manners, but still your elth’s\\nyour elth.”\\n\\nBy this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,\\nand, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little\\nwhile against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking\\nguiltily on.\\n\\n“Now, perhaps you’ll mention what’s the matter,” said my sister, out of\\nbreath, “you staring great stuck pig.”\\n\\nJoe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and\\nlooked at me again.\\n\\n“You know, Pip,” said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,\\nand speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,\\n“you and me is always friends, and I’d be the last to tell upon you,\\nany time. But such a—” he moved his chair and looked about the floor\\nbetween us, and then again at me—“such a most oncommon Bolt as that!”\\n\\n“Been bolting his food, has he?” cried my sister.\\n\\n“You know, old chap,” said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,\\nwith his bite still in his cheek, “I Bolted, myself, when I was your\\nage—frequent—and as a boy I’ve been among a many Bolters; but I never\\nsee your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it’s a mercy you ain’t Bolted\\ndead.”\\n\\nMy sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying\\nnothing more than the awful words, “You come along and be dosed.”\\n\\nSome medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine\\nmedicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;\\nhaving a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the\\nbest of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a\\nchoice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like\\na new fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded\\na pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater\\ncomfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be\\nheld in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to\\nswallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and\\nmeditating before the fire), “because he had had a turn.” Judging from\\nmyself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had\\nnone before.\\n\\nConscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in\\nthe case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret\\nburden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great\\npunishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe—I\\nnever thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the\\nhousekeeping property as his—united to the necessity of always keeping\\none hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about\\nthe kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,\\nas the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the\\nvoice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to\\nsecrecy, declaring that he couldn’t and wouldn’t starve until\\nto-morrow, but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the\\nyoung man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his\\nhands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should\\nmistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart and\\nliver to-night, instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody’s hair stood on\\nend with terror, mine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody’s\\never did?\\n\\nIt was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with\\na copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with\\nthe load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the\\nload on _his_ leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the\\nbread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped\\naway, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.\\n\\n“Hark!” said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final\\nwarm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; “was that great\\nguns, Joe?”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Joe. “There’s another conwict off.”\\n\\n“What does that mean, Joe?” said I.\\n\\nMrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,\\n“Escaped. Escaped.” Administering the definition like Tar-water.\\n\\nWhile Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my\\nmouth into the forms of saying to Joe, “What’s a convict?” Joe put\\n_his_ mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer,\\nthat I could make out nothing of it but the single word “Pip.”\\n\\n“There was a conwict off last night,” said Joe, aloud, “after\\nsunset-gun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they’re\\nfiring warning of another.”\\n\\n“_Who’s_ firing?” said I.\\n\\n“Drat that boy,” interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,\\n“what a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you’ll be told no\\nlies.”\\n\\nIt was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be\\ntold lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was polite\\nunless there was company.\\n\\nAt this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost\\npains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a\\nword that looked to me like “sulks.” Therefore, I naturally pointed to\\nMrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, “her?” But Joe\\nwouldn’t hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide,\\nand shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make\\nnothing of the word.\\n\\n“Mrs. Joe,” said I, as a last resort, “I should like to know—if you\\nwouldn’t much mind—where the firing comes from?”\\n\\n“Lord bless the boy!” exclaimed my sister, as if she didn’t quite mean\\nthat but rather the contrary. “From the Hulks!”\\n\\n“Oh-h!” said I, looking at Joe. “Hulks!”\\n\\nJoe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, “Well, I told you so.”\\n\\n“And please, what’s Hulks?” said I.\\n\\n“That’s the way with this boy!” exclaimed my sister, pointing me out\\nwith her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. “Answer him one\\nquestion, and he’ll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,\\nright ’cross th’ meshes.” We always used that name for marshes, in our\\ncountry.\\n\\n“I wonder who’s put into prison-ships, and why they’re put there?” said\\nI, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.\\n\\nIt was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. “I tell you what,\\nyoung fellow,” said she, “I didn’t bring you up by hand to badger\\npeople’s lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.\\nPeople are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,\\nand forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking\\nquestions. Now, you get along to bed!”\\n\\nI was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went\\nupstairs in the dark, with my head tingling,—from Mrs. Joe’s thimble\\nhaving played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,—I\\nfelt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were\\nhandy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking\\nquestions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.\\n\\nSince that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought\\nthat few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.\\nNo matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in\\nmortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in\\nmortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal\\nterror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had\\nno hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed me\\nat every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on\\nrequirement, in the secrecy of my terror.\\n\\nIf I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting\\ndown the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly pirate\\ncalling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the\\ngibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at\\nonce, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been\\ninclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob\\nthe pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no\\ngetting a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have\\nstruck it out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very\\npirate himself rattling his chains.\\n\\nAs soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was\\nshot with grey, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way,\\nand every crack in every board calling after me, “Stop thief!” and “Get\\nup, Mrs. Joe!” In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied\\nthan usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare\\nhanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back\\nwas half turned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for\\nselection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole\\nsome bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I\\ntied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night’s slice), some\\nbrandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had\\nsecretly used for making that intoxicating fluid,\\nSpanish-liquorice-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle from\\na jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone with very little on it, and\\na beautiful round compact pork pie. I was nearly going away without the\\npie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was that\\nwas put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner,\\nand I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was not\\nintended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.\\n\\nThere was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I\\nunlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe’s tools.\\nThen I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which\\nI had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the\\nmisty marshes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter III.\\n\\n\\nIt was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the\\noutside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there\\nall night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw\\nthe damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort\\nof spiders’ webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.\\nOn every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so\\nthick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our\\nvillage—a direction which they never accepted, for they never came\\nthere—was invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I\\nlooked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience\\nlike a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.\\n\\nThe mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that\\ninstead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.\\nThis was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and\\nbanks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly\\nas could be, “A boy with somebody else’s pork pie! Stop him!” The\\ncattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,\\nand steaming out of their nostrils, “Halloa, young thief!” One black\\nox, with a white cravat on,—who even had to my awakened conscience\\nsomething of a clerical air,—fixed me so obstinately with his eyes, and\\nmoved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved\\nround, that I blubbered out to him, “I couldn’t help it, sir! It wasn’t\\nfor myself I took it!” Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of\\nsmoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and\\na flourish of his tail.\\n\\nAll this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I\\nwent, I couldn’t warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted,\\nas the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I\\nknew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there\\non a Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that\\nwhen I was ’prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larks\\nthere! However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last\\ntoo far to the right, and consequently had to try back along the\\nriver-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes\\nthat staked the tide out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I\\nhad just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and\\nhad just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man\\nsitting before me. His back was towards me, and he had his arms folded,\\nand was nodding forward, heavy with sleep.\\n\\nI thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast,\\nin that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on\\nthe shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but\\nanother man!\\n\\nAnd yet this man was dressed in coarse grey, too, and had a great iron\\non his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that\\nthe other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flat\\nbroad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for\\nI had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit at\\nme,—it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself\\ndown, for it made him stumble,—and then he ran into the mist, stumbling\\ntwice as he went, and I lost him.\\n\\n“It’s the young man!” I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified\\nhim. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had\\nknown where it was.\\n\\nI was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right\\nman,—hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all\\nnight left off hugging and limping,—waiting for me. He was awfully\\ncold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face\\nand die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that\\nwhen I handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it\\noccurred to me he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my\\nbundle. He did not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had,\\nbut left me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my\\npockets.\\n\\n“What’s in the bottle, boy?” said he.\\n\\n“Brandy,” said I.\\n\\nHe was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious\\nmanner,—more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent\\nhurry, than a man who was eating it,—but he left off to take some of\\nthe liquor. He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite\\nas much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his\\nteeth, without biting it off.\\n\\n“I think you have got the ague,” said I.\\n\\n“I’m much of your opinion, boy,” said he.\\n\\n“It’s bad about here,” I told him. “You’ve been lying out on the\\nmeshes, and they’re dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too.”\\n\\n“I’ll eat my breakfast afore they’re the death of me,” said he. “I’d do\\nthat, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is\\nover there, directly afterwards. I’ll beat the shivers so far, I’ll bet\\nyou.”\\n\\nHe was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all\\nat once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round\\nus, and often stopping—even stopping his jaws—to listen. Some real or\\nfancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the\\nmarsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,—\\n\\n“You’re not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?”\\n\\n“No, sir! No!”\\n\\n“Nor giv’ no one the office to follow you?”\\n\\n“No!”\\n\\n“Well,” said he, “I believe you. You’d be but a fierce young hound\\nindeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched\\nwarmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint\\nis!”\\n\\nSomething clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock,\\nand was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over\\nhis eyes.\\n\\nPitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down\\nupon the pie, I made bold to say, “I am glad you enjoy it.”\\n\\n“Did you speak?”\\n\\n“I said I was glad you enjoyed it.”\\n\\n“Thankee, my boy. I do.”\\n\\nI had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I now\\nnoticed a decided similarity between the dog’s way of eating, and the\\nman’s. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. He\\nswallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;\\nand he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought\\nthere was danger in every direction of somebody’s coming to take the\\npie away. He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, to\\nappreciate it comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with\\nhim, without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor. In all of\\nwhich particulars he was very like the dog.\\n\\n“I am afraid you won’t leave any of it for him,” said I, timidly; after\\na silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making\\nthe remark. “There’s no more to be got where that came from.” It was\\nthe certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.\\n\\n“Leave any for him? Who’s him?” said my friend, stopping in his\\ncrunching of pie-crust.\\n\\n“The young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you.”\\n\\n“Oh ah!” he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. “Him? Yes,\\nyes! _He_ don’t want no wittles.”\\n\\n“I thought he looked as if he did,” said I.\\n\\nThe man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and\\nthe greatest surprise.\\n\\n“Looked? When?”\\n\\n“Just now.”\\n\\n“Where?”\\n\\n“Yonder,” said I, pointing; “over there, where I found him nodding\\nasleep, and thought it was you.”\\n\\nHe held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his\\nfirst idea about cutting my throat had revived.\\n\\n“Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat,” I explained, trembling;\\n“and—and”—I was very anxious to put this delicately—“and with—the same\\nreason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn’t you hear the cannon last\\nnight?”\\n\\n“Then there _was_ firing!” he said to himself.\\n\\n“I wonder you shouldn’t have been sure of that,” I returned, “for we\\nheard it up at home, and that’s farther away, and we were shut in\\nbesides.”\\n\\n“Why, see now!” said he. “When a man’s alone on these flats, with a\\nlight head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears\\nnothin’ all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He sees\\nthe soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried\\nafore, closing in round him. Hears his number called, hears himself\\nchallenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders ‘Make\\nready! Present! Cover him steady, men!’ and is laid hands on—and\\nthere’s nothin’! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night—coming up\\nin order, Damn ’em, with their tramp, tramp—I see a hundred. And as to\\nfiring! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad\\nday,—But this man”; he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my\\nbeing there; “did you notice anything in him?”\\n\\n“He had a badly bruised face,” said I, recalling what I hardly knew I\\nknew.\\n\\n“Not here?” exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly,\\nwith the flat of his hand.\\n\\n“Yes, there!”\\n\\n“Where is he?” He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of\\nhis grey jacket. “Show me the way he went. I’ll pull him down, like a\\nbloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file,\\nboy.”\\n\\nI indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man, and\\nhe looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on the rank wet\\ngrass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding\\nhis own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which\\nhe handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file.\\nI was very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself\\ninto this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping\\naway from home any longer. I told him I must go, but he took no notice,\\nso I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw\\nof him, his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his\\nfetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg. The last\\nI heard of him, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still\\ngoing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IV.\\n\\n\\nI fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me\\nup. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet\\nbeen made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the\\nhouse ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon\\nthe kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,—an article into\\nwhich his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was\\nvigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.\\n\\n“And where the deuce ha’ _you_ been?” was Mrs. Joe’s Christmas\\nsalutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.\\n\\nI said I had been down to hear the Carols. “Ah! well!” observed Mrs.\\nJoe. “You might ha’ done worse.” Not a doubt of that I thought.\\n\\n“Perhaps if I warn’t a blacksmith’s wife, and (what’s the same thing) a\\nslave with her apron never off, _I_ should have been to hear the\\nCarols,” said Mrs. Joe. “I’m rather partial to Carols, myself, and\\nthat’s the best of reasons for my never hearing any.”\\n\\nJoe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had\\nretired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a\\nconciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her\\neyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and\\nexhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.\\nThis was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for\\nweeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to\\ntheir legs.\\n\\nWe were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork\\nand greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had\\nbeen made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not\\nbeing missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive\\narrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of\\nbreakfast; “for I ain’t,” said Mrs. Joe,—“I ain’t a-going to have no\\nformal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I’ve got\\nbefore me, I promise you!”\\n\\nSo, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on\\na forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of\\nmilk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the\\ndresser. In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and\\ntacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the\\nold one, and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage,\\nwhich was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the\\nyear in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four\\nlittle white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black\\nnose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of\\nthe other. Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite\\nart of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than\\ndirt itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the\\nsame by their religion.\\n\\nMy sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that\\nis to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a\\nwell-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he\\nwas more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.\\nNothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and\\neverything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive\\noccasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going,\\nthe picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me,\\nI think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young\\noffender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and\\ndelivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged\\nmajesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on being\\nborn in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality,\\nand against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I\\nwas taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make\\nthem like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the\\nfree use of my limbs.\\n\\nJoe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle\\nfor compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to\\nwhat I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.\\nJoe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be\\nequalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had\\ndone. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the\\nChurch would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the\\nterrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived\\nthe idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman\\nsaid, “Ye are now to declare it!” would be the time for me to rise and\\npropose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure\\nthat I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to\\nthis extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.\\n\\nMr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble\\nthe wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle,\\nbut Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in\\nthe nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was\\nhalf-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and\\nMrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked\\n(it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and\\neverything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.\\n\\nThe time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and\\nthe company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large\\nshining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud\\nof; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could\\nonly give him his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he\\nhimself confessed that if the Church was “thrown open,” meaning to\\ncompetition, he would not despair of making his mark in it. The Church\\nnot being “thrown open,” he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he\\npunished the Amens tremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,—always\\ngiving the whole verse,—he looked all round the congregation first, as\\nmuch as to say, “You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your\\nopinion of this style!”\\n\\nI opened the door to the company,—making believe that it was a habit of\\nours to open that door,—and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next to\\nMr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. _I_ was\\nnot allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.\\n\\n“Mrs. Joe,” said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged\\nslow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair\\nstanding upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been\\nall but choked, and had that moment come to, “I have brought you as the\\ncompliments of the season—I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry\\nwine—and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.”\\n\\nEvery Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with\\nexactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.\\nEvery Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, “O, Un—cle\\nPum-ble—chook! This _is_ kind!” Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as he\\nnow retorted, “It’s no more than your merits. And now are you all\\nbobbish, and how’s Sixpennorth of halfpence?” meaning me.\\n\\nWe dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts\\nand oranges and apples to the parlour; which was a change very like\\nJoe’s change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister\\nwas uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally\\nmore gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I\\nremember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue,\\nwho held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married\\nMr. Hubble,—I don’t know at what remote period,—when she was much\\nyounger than he. I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered,\\nstooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs\\nextraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some\\nmiles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.\\n\\nAmong this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn’t\\nrobbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in\\nat an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and\\nthe Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to\\nspeak (I didn’t want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the\\nscaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure\\ncorners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason\\nto be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have\\nleft me alone. But they wouldn’t leave me alone. They seemed to think\\nthe opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me,\\nevery now and then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an\\nunfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched\\nup by these moral goads.\\n\\nIt began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with\\ntheatrical declamation,—as it now appears to me, something like a\\nreligious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,—and\\nended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.\\nUpon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low\\nreproachful voice, “Do you hear that? Be grateful.”\\n\\n“Especially,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “be grateful, boy, to them which\\nbrought you up by hand.”\\n\\nMrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful\\npresentiment that I should come to no good, asked, “Why is it that the\\nyoung are never grateful?” This moral mystery seemed too much for the\\ncompany until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, “Naterally\\nwicious.” Everybody then murmured “True!” and looked at me in a\\nparticularly unpleasant and personal manner.\\n\\nJoe’s station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when\\nthere was company than when there was none. But he always aided and\\ncomforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did\\nso at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being\\nplenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about\\nhalf a pint.\\n\\nA little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with\\nsome severity, and intimated—in the usual hypothetical case of the\\nChurch being “thrown open”—what kind of sermon _he_ would have given\\nthem. After favouring them with some heads of that discourse, he\\nremarked that he considered the subject of the day’s homily, ill\\nchosen; which was the less excusable, he added, when there were so many\\nsubjects “going about.”\\n\\n“True again,” said Uncle Pumblechook. “You’ve hit it, sir! Plenty of\\nsubjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their\\ntails. That’s what’s wanted. A man needn’t go far to find a subject, if\\nhe’s ready with his salt-box.” Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short\\ninterval of reflection, “Look at Pork alone. There’s a subject! If you\\nwant a subject, look at Pork!”\\n\\n“True, sir. Many a moral for the young,” returned Mr. Wopsle,—and I\\nknew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; “might be deduced\\nfrom that text.”\\n\\n(“You listen to this,” said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)\\n\\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\\n\\n“Swine,” pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his\\nfork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,—“swine\\nwere the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put\\nbefore us, as an example to the young.” (I thought this pretty well in\\nhim who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.)\\n“What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.”\\n\\n“Or girl,” suggested Mr. Hubble.\\n\\n“Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,” assented Mr. Wopsle, rather\\nirritably, “but there is no girl present.”\\n\\n“Besides,” said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, “think what\\nyou’ve got to be grateful for. If you’d been born a Squeaker—”\\n\\n“He _was_, if ever a child was,” said my sister, most emphatically.\\n\\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\\n\\n“Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “If\\nyou had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you—”\\n\\n“Unless in that form,” said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.\\n\\n“But I don’t mean in that form, sir,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had\\nan objection to being interrupted; “I mean, enjoying himself with his\\nelders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and\\nrolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he\\nwouldn’t. And what would have been your destination?” turning on me\\nagain. “You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according\\nto the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would\\nhave come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped\\nyou under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his\\nfrock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would\\nhave shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then.\\nNot a bit of it!”\\n\\nJoe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.\\n\\n“He was a world of trouble to you, ma’am,” said Mrs. Hubble,\\ncommiserating my sister.\\n\\n“Trouble?” echoed my sister; “trouble?” and then entered on a fearful\\ncatalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts\\nof sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled\\nfrom, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I\\nhad done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I\\nhad contumaciously refused to go there.\\n\\nI think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with\\ntheir noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in\\nconsequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle’s Roman nose so aggravated me, during\\nthe recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it\\nuntil he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in\\ncomparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the\\npause was broken which ensued upon my sister’s recital, and in which\\npause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with\\nindignation and abhorrence.\\n\\n“Yet,” said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the\\ntheme from which they had strayed, “Pork—regarded as biled—is rich,\\ntoo; ain’t it?”\\n\\n“Have a little brandy, uncle,” said my sister.\\n\\nO Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say\\nit was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under\\nthe cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.\\n\\nMy sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,\\nand poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man\\ntrifled with his glass,—took it up, looked at it through the light, put\\nit down,—prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were\\nbriskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.\\n\\nI couldn’t keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the\\ntable with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his\\nglass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink the\\nbrandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with\\nunspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning\\nround several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and\\nrushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,\\nviolently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces,\\nand apparently out of his mind.\\n\\nI held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn’t know how I\\nhad done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my\\ndreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and\\nsurveying the company all round as if _they_ had disagreed with him,\\nsank down into his chair with the one significant gasp, “Tar!”\\n\\nI had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would be\\nworse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day,\\nby the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.\\n\\n“Tar!” cried my sister, in amazement. “Why, how ever could Tar come\\nthere?”\\n\\nBut, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn’t\\nhear the word, wouldn’t hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all\\naway with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had\\nbegun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in\\ngetting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and\\nmixing them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on\\nto the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of\\ngratitude.\\n\\nBy degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of\\npudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding.\\nThe course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the\\ngenial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over\\nthe day, when my sister said to Joe, “Clean plates,—cold.”\\n\\nI clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my\\nbosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my\\nsoul. I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was\\ngone.\\n\\n“You must taste,” said my sister, addressing the guests with her best\\ngrace—“you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious\\npresent of Uncle Pumblechook’s!”\\n\\nMust they! Let them not hope to taste it!\\n\\n“You must know,” said my sister, rising, “it’s a pie; a savory pork\\npie.”\\n\\nThe company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of\\nhaving deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,—quite vivaciously,\\nall things considered,—“Well, Mrs. Joe, we’ll do our best endeavours;\\nlet us have a cut at this same pie.”\\n\\nMy sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry.\\nI saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in\\nthe Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that “a bit\\nof savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do\\nno harm,” and I heard Joe say, “You shall have some, Pip.” I have never\\nbeen absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,\\nmerely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that\\nI could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of\\nthe table, and ran for my life.\\n\\nBut I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost\\ninto a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a\\npair of handcuffs to me, saying, “Here you are, look sharp, come on!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter V.\\n\\n\\nThe apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their\\nloaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise from\\ntable in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen\\nempty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of\\n“Gracious goodness gracious me, what’s gone—with the—pie!”\\n\\nThe sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring; at\\nwhich crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was the\\nsergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at the\\ncompany, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his\\nright hand, and his left on my shoulder.\\n\\n“Excuse me, ladies and gentleman,” said the sergeant, “but as I have\\nmentioned at the door to this smart young shaver,” (which he hadn’t),\\n“I am on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith.”\\n\\n“And pray what might you want with _him_?” retorted my sister, quick to\\nresent his being wanted at all.\\n\\n“Missis,” returned the gallant sergeant, “speaking for myself, I should\\nreply, the honour and pleasure of his fine wife’s acquaintance;\\nspeaking for the king, I answer, a little job done.”\\n\\nThis was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr.\\nPumblechook cried audibly, “Good again!”\\n\\n“You see, blacksmith,” said the sergeant, who had by this time picked\\nout Joe with his eye, “we have had an accident with these, and I find\\nthe lock of one of ’em goes wrong, and the coupling don’t act pretty.\\nAs they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over\\nthem?”\\n\\nJoe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would\\nnecessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer two\\nhours than one. “Will it? Then will you set about it at once,\\nblacksmith?” said the off-hand sergeant, “as it’s on his Majesty’s\\nservice. And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they’ll make\\nthemselves useful.” With that, he called to his men, who came trooping\\ninto the kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner.\\nAnd then they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands\\nloosely clasped before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now,\\neasing a belt or a pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over\\ntheir high stocks, out into the yard.\\n\\nAll these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I was\\nin an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that the\\nhandcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the\\nbetter of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little\\nmore of my scattered wits.\\n\\n“Would you give me the time?” said the sergeant, addressing himself to\\nMr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the\\ninference that he was equal to the time.\\n\\n“It’s just gone half past two.”\\n\\n“That’s not so bad,” said the sergeant, reflecting; “even if I was\\nforced to halt here nigh two hours, that’ll do. How far might you call\\nyourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?”\\n\\n“Just a mile,” said Mrs. Joe.\\n\\n“That’ll do. We begin to close in upon ’em about dusk. A little before\\ndusk, my orders are. That’ll do.”\\n\\n“Convicts, sergeant?” asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.\\n\\n“Ay!” returned the sergeant, “two. They’re pretty well known to be out\\non the marshes still, and they won’t try to get clear of ’em before\\ndusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?”\\n\\nEverybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of\\nme.\\n\\n“Well!” said the sergeant, “they’ll find themselves trapped in a\\ncircle, I expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If you’re\\nready, his Majesty the King is.”\\n\\nJoe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather\\napron on, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its\\nwooden windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the\\nbellows, the rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. Then\\nJoe began to hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.\\n\\nThe interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general\\nattention, but even made my sister liberal. She drew a pitcher of beer\\nfrom the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a\\nglass of brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, “Give him wine,\\nMum. I’ll engage there’s no tar in that:” so, the sergeant thanked him\\nand said that as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take\\nwine, if it was equally convenient. When it was given him, he drank his\\nMajesty’s health and compliments of the season, and took it all at a\\nmouthful and smacked his lips.\\n\\n“Good stuff, eh, sergeant?” said Mr. Pumblechook.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you something,” returned the sergeant; “I suspect that\\nstuff’s of _your_ providing.”\\n\\nMr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, “Ay, ay? Why?”\\n\\n“Because,” returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, “you’re\\na man that knows what’s what.”\\n\\n“D’ye think so?” said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh. “Have\\nanother glass!”\\n\\n“With you. Hob and nob,” returned the sergeant. “The top of mine to the\\nfoot of yours,—the foot of yours to the top of mine,—Ring once, ring\\ntwice,—the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. May you live\\na thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you\\nare at the present moment of your life!”\\n\\nThe sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for\\nanother glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality\\nappeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the\\nbottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a\\ngush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine\\nthat he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with\\nthe same liberality, when the first was gone.\\n\\nAs I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,\\nenjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for a\\ndinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed\\nthemselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened\\nwith the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively\\nanticipation of “the two villains” being taken, and when the bellows\\nseemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke\\nto hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and\\nall the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the\\nblaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale\\nafternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have\\nturned pale on their account, poor wretches.\\n\\nAt last, Joe’s job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As\\nJoe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us\\nshould go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr.\\nPumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies’\\nsociety; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was\\nagreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should\\nhave got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe’s curiosity to know\\nall about it and how it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, “If\\nyou bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket, don’t\\nlook to me to put it together again.”\\n\\nThe sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.\\nPumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully\\nsensible of that gentleman’s merits under arid conditions, as when\\nsomething moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in.\\nMr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and\\nto speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in\\nthe raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I\\ntreasonably whispered to Joe, “I hope, Joe, we shan’t find them.” and\\nJoe whispered to me, “I’d give a shilling if they had cut and run,\\nPip.”\\n\\nWe were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was\\ncold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming\\non, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A\\nfew faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came\\nout. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.\\nThere we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant’s\\nhand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the\\ngraves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding\\nanything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate\\nat the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us\\nhere on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.\\n\\nNow that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little\\nthought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men\\nhiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should\\ncome upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who\\nhad brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving\\nimp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the\\nhunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in\\ntreacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?\\n\\nIt was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe’s\\nback, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a\\nhunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and\\nto keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a\\npretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking\\nthe course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.\\nEither the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.\\nUnder the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the\\nmound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,\\nthough all of a watery lead colour.\\n\\nWith my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe’s broad shoulder, I\\nlooked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I\\ncould hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by\\nhis blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and\\ncould dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful\\nstart, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a\\nsheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us;\\nand the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared\\nangrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except\\nthese things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,\\nthere was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.\\n\\nThe soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we\\nwere moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all\\nstopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a\\nlong shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but\\nit was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised\\ntogether,—if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.\\n\\nTo this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under\\ntheir breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment’s listening,\\nJoe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)\\nagreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not\\nbe answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men\\nshould make towards it “at the double.” So we slanted to the right\\n(where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had\\nto hold on tight to keep my seat.\\n\\nIt was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he\\nspoke all the time, “a Winder.” Down banks and up banks, and over\\ngates, and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no\\nman cared where he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became\\nmore and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.\\nSometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.\\nWhen it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate\\nthan ever, and we after them. After a while, we had so run it down,\\nthat we could hear one voice calling “Murder!” and another voice,\\n“Convicts! Runaways! Guard! This way for the runaway convicts!” Then\\nboth voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then would\\nbreak out again. And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran like\\ndeer, and Joe too.\\n\\nThe sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and\\ntwo of his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked and\\nlevelled when we all ran in.\\n\\n“Here are both men!” panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a\\nditch. “Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come\\nasunder!”\\n\\nWater was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn,\\nand blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the\\nditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and\\nthe other one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and\\nstruggling; but of course I knew them both directly.\\n\\n“Mind!” said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged\\nsleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: “_I_ took him! _I_\\ngive him up to you! Mind that!”\\n\\n“It’s not much to be particular about,” said the sergeant; “it’ll do\\nyou small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs\\nthere!”\\n\\n“I don’t expect it to do me any good. I don’t want it to do me more\\ngood than it does now,” said my convict, with a greedy laugh. “I took\\nhim. He knows it. That’s enough for me.”\\n\\nThe other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old\\nbruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.\\nHe could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both\\nseparately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from\\nfalling.\\n\\n“Take notice, guard,—he tried to murder me,” were his first words.\\n\\n“Tried to murder him?” said my convict, disdainfully. “Try, and not do\\nit? I took him, and giv’ him up; that’s what I done. I not only\\nprevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,—dragged\\nhim this far on his way back. He’s a gentleman, if you please, this\\nvillain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder\\nhim? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag\\nhim back!”\\n\\nThe other one still gasped, “He tried—he tried-to—murder me. Bear—bear\\nwitness.”\\n\\n“Lookee here!” said my convict to the sergeant. “Single-handed I got\\nclear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha’ got\\nclear of these death-cold flats likewise—look at my leg: you won’t find\\nmuch iron on it—if I hadn’t made the discovery that _he_ was here. Let\\n_him_ go free? Let _him_ profit by the means as I found out? Let _him_\\nmake a tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had\\ndied at the bottom there,” and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch\\nwith his manacled hands, “I’d have held to him with that grip, that you\\nshould have been safe to find him in my hold.”\\n\\nThe other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his\\ncompanion, repeated, “He tried to murder me. I should have been a dead\\nman if you had not come up.”\\n\\n“He lies!” said my convict, with fierce energy. “He’s a liar born, and\\nhe’ll die a liar. Look at his face; ain’t it written there? Let him\\nturn those eyes of his on me. I defy him to do it.”\\n\\nThe other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not,\\nhowever, collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set\\nexpression, looked at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and\\nat the sky, but certainly did not look at the speaker.\\n\\n“Do you see him?” pursued my convict. “Do you see what a villain he is?\\nDo you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That’s how he looked\\nwhen we were tried together. He never looked at me.”\\n\\nThe other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes\\nrestlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a moment\\non the speaker, with the words, “You are not much to look at,” and with\\na half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict\\nbecame so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him\\nbut for the interposition of the soldiers. “Didn’t I tell you,” said\\nthe other convict then, “that he would murder me, if he could?” And any\\none could see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon\\nhis lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.\\n\\n“Enough of this parley,” said the sergeant. “Light those torches.”\\n\\nAs one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went\\ndown on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first\\ntime, and saw me. I had alighted from Joe’s back on the brink of the\\nditch when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly\\nwhen he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I\\nhad been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my\\ninnocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended\\nmy intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it\\nall passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a\\nday, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having\\nbeen more attentive.\\n\\nThe soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four\\ntorches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been\\nalmost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards\\nvery dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in\\na ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches\\nkindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the\\nopposite bank of the river. “All right,” said the sergeant. “March.”\\n\\nWe had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a\\nsound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. “You are expected\\non board,” said the sergeant to my convict; “they know you are coming.\\nDon’t straggle, my man. Close up here.”\\n\\nThe two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate\\nguard. I had hold of Joe’s hand now, and Joe carried one of the\\ntorches. Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to\\nsee it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good\\npath now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and\\nthere where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy\\nsluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming\\nin after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon\\nthe track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I\\ncould see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air\\nabout us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather\\nto like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets. We\\ncould not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent,\\nthat two or three times we had to halt while they rested.\\n\\nAfter an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut\\nand a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,\\nand the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was\\na smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a\\nstand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an\\novergrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a\\ndozen soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in\\ntheir great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their\\nheads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant\\nmade some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the\\nconvict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard,\\nto go on board first.\\n\\nMy convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the\\nhut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up\\nhis feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if\\nhe pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the\\nsergeant, and remarked,—\\n\\n“I wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some\\npersons laying under suspicion alonger me.”\\n\\n“You can say what you like,” returned the sergeant, standing coolly\\nlooking at him with his arms folded, “but you have no call to say it\\nhere. You’ll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about\\nit, before it’s done with, you know.”\\n\\n“I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can’t\\nstarve; at least _I_ can’t. I took some wittles, up at the willage over\\nyonder,—where the church stands a’most out on the marshes.”\\n\\n“You mean stole,” said the sergeant.\\n\\n“And I’ll tell you where from. From the blacksmith’s.”\\n\\n“Halloa!” said the sergeant, staring at Joe.\\n\\n“Halloa, Pip!” said Joe, staring at me.\\n\\n“It was some broken wittles—that’s what it was—and a dram of liquor,\\nand a pie.”\\n\\n“Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?” asked\\nthe sergeant, confidentially.\\n\\n“My wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don’t you know,\\nPip?”\\n\\n“So,” said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and\\nwithout the least glance at me,—“so you’re the blacksmith, are you?\\nThan I’m sorry to say, I’ve eat your pie.”\\n\\n“God knows you’re welcome to it,—so far as it was ever mine,” returned\\nJoe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. “We don’t know what you\\nhave done, but we wouldn’t have you starved to death for it, poor\\nmiserable fellow-creatur.—Would us, Pip?”\\n\\nThe something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man’s throat\\nagain, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard\\nwere ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough\\nstakes and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a\\ncrew of convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or\\ninterested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or\\nspoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs,\\n“Give way, you!” which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the\\nlight of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from\\nthe mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah’s ark. Cribbed and barred and\\nmoored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes\\nto be ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we\\nsaw him taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches\\nwere flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over\\nwith him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VI.\\n\\n\\nMy state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so\\nunexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I\\nhope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.\\n\\nI do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference\\nto Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But I\\nloved Joe,—perhaps for no better reason in those early days than\\nbecause the dear fellow let me love him,—and, as to him, my inner self\\nwas not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when\\nI first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe\\nthe whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted\\nthat if I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing\\nJoe’s confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at\\nnight staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up\\nmy tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I\\nnever afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair\\nwhisker, without thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe\\nknew it, I never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at\\nyesterday’s meat or pudding when it came on to-day’s table, without\\nthinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That,\\nif Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life\\nremarked that his beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he\\nsuspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word,\\nI was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too\\ncowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong. I had had no\\nintercourse with the world at that time, and I imitated none of its\\nmany inhabitants who act in this manner. Quite an untaught genius, I\\nmade the discovery of the line of action for myself.\\n\\nAs I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took\\nme on his back again and carried me home. He must have had a tiresome\\njourney of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad\\ntemper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably have\\nexcommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. In\\nhis lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an\\ninsane extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the\\nkitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have\\nhanged him, if it had been a capital offence.\\n\\nBy that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little\\ndrunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through\\nhaving been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and\\nnoise of tongues. As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump\\nbetween the shoulders, and the restorative exclamation “Yah! Was there\\never such a boy as this!” from my sister,) I found Joe telling them\\nabout the convict’s confession, and all the visitors suggesting\\ndifferent ways by which he had got into the pantry. Mr. Pumblechook\\nmade out, after carefully surveying the premises, that he had first got\\nupon the roof of the forge, and had then got upon the roof of the\\nhouse, and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made\\nof his bedding cut into strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very\\npositive and drove his own chaise-cart—over everybody—it was agreed\\nthat it must be so. Mr. Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, “No!” with\\nthe feeble malice of a tired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coat\\non, he was unanimously set at naught,—not to mention his smoking hard\\nbehind, as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp\\nout: which was not calculated to inspire confidence.\\n\\nThis was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a\\nslumberous offence to the company’s eyesight, and assisted me up to bed\\nwith such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be\\ndangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, as\\nI have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted\\nlong after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned\\nsaving on exceptional occasions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VII.\\n\\n\\nAt the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family\\ntombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My\\nconstruction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I\\nread “wife of the Above” as a complimentary reference to my father’s\\nexaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations\\nhad been referred to as “Below,” I have no doubt I should have formed\\nthe worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were my\\nnotions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at\\nall accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my\\ndeclaration that I was to “walk in the same all the days of my life,”\\nlaid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our\\nhouse in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down\\nby the wheelwright’s or up by the mill.\\n\\nWhen I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I\\ncould assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called\\n“Pompeyed,” or (as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not only\\nodd-boy about the forge, but if any neighbour happened to want an extra\\nboy to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was\\nfavoured with the employment. In order, however, that our superior\\nposition might not be compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the\\nkitchen mantel-shelf, into which it was publicly made known that all my\\nearnings were dropped. I have an impression that they were to be\\ncontributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt,\\nbut I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.\\n\\nMr. Wopsle’s great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is\\nto say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited\\ninfirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in\\nthe society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the\\nimproving opportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage,\\nand Mr. Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to\\noverhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and\\noccasionally bumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr.\\nWopsle “examined” the scholars once a quarter. What he did on those\\noccasions was to turn up his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark\\nAntony’s oration over the body of Caesar. This was always followed by\\nCollins’s Ode on the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr.\\nWopsle as Revenge throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and\\ntaking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not\\nwith me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of\\nthe Passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the\\ndisadvantage of both gentlemen.\\n\\nMr. Wopsle’s great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,\\nkept in the same room—a little general shop. She had no idea what stock\\nshe had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a\\nlittle greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a\\nCatalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop\\ntransactions. Biddy was Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s granddaughter; I\\nconfess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem, what\\nrelation she was to Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me,\\ntoo, had been brought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought,\\nin respect of her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing,\\nher hands always wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending\\nand pulling up at heel. This description must be received with a\\nweek-day limitation. On Sundays, she went to church elaborated.\\n\\nMuch of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.\\nWopsle’s great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been\\na bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every\\nletter. After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who\\nseemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and\\nbaffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to\\nread, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.\\n\\nOne night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending\\ngreat efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it must\\nhave been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a\\nlong time after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet\\non the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two\\nto print and smear this epistle:—\\n\\n“MI DEER JO i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE\\nU JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN\\nBLEVE ME INF XN PIP.”\\n\\n\\nThere was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by\\nletter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. But I delivered\\nthis written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joe\\nreceived it as a miracle of erudition.\\n\\n“I say, Pip, old chap!” cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, “what a\\nscholar you are! An’t you?”\\n\\n“I should like to be,” said I, glancing at the slate as he held it;\\nwith a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.\\n\\n“Why, here’s a J,” said Joe, “and a O equal to anythink! Here’s a J and\\na O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.”\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nI had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this\\nmonosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I\\naccidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit\\nhis convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to\\nembrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I\\nshould have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, “Ah! But read the\\nrest, Jo.”\\n\\n“The rest, eh, Pip?” said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching\\neye, “One, two, three. Why, here’s three Js, and three Os, and three\\nJ-O, Joes in it, Pip!”\\n\\nI leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the\\nwhole letter.\\n\\n“Astonishing!” said Joe, when I had finished. “You ARE a scholar.”\\n\\n“How do you spell Gargery, Joe?” I asked him, with a modest patronage.\\n\\n“I don’t spell it at all,” said Joe.\\n\\n“But supposing you did?”\\n\\n“It _can’t_ be supposed,” said Joe. “Tho’ I’m uncommon fond of reading,\\ntoo.”\\n\\n“Are you, Joe?”\\n\\n“On-common. Give me,” said Joe, “a good book, or a good newspaper, and\\nsit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!” he\\ncontinued, after rubbing his knees a little, “when you _do_ come to a J\\nand a O, and says you, ‘Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,’ how interesting\\nreading is!”\\n\\nI derived from this, that Joe’s education, like Steam, was yet in its\\ninfancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,—\\n\\n“Didn’t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”\\n\\n“No, Pip.”\\n\\n“Why didn’t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”\\n\\n“Well, Pip,” said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to his\\nusual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire\\nbetween the lower bars; “I’ll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given\\nto drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at my\\nmother, most onmerciful. It were a’most the only hammering he did,\\nindeed, ’xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only to\\nbe equalled by the wigor with which he didn’t hammer at his\\nanwil.—You’re a listening and understanding, Pip?”\\n\\n“Yes, Joe.”\\n\\n“Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several\\ntimes; and then my mother she’d go out to work, and she’d say, “Joe,”\\nshe’d say, “now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,” and\\nshe’d put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that\\nhe couldn’t abear to be without us. So, he’d come with a most\\ntremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where\\nwe was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us\\nand to give us up to him. And then he took us home and hammered us.\\nWhich, you see, Pip,” said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the\\nfire, and looking at me, “were a drawback on my learning.”\\n\\n“Certainly, poor Joe!”\\n\\n“Though mind you, Pip,” said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the\\npoker on the top bar, “rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining\\nequal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his\\nhart, don’t you see?”\\n\\nI didn’t see; but I didn’t say so.\\n\\n“Well!” Joe pursued, “somebody must keep the pot a-biling, Pip, or the\\npot won’t bile, don’t you know?”\\n\\nI saw that, and said so.\\n\\n“Consequence, my father didn’t make objections to my going to work; so\\nI went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he would\\nhave followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure _you_, Pip. In\\ntime I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in a\\npurple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon his\\ntombstone that, Whatsume’er the failings on his part, Remember reader\\nhe were that good in his heart.”\\n\\nJoe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful\\nperspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself.\\n\\n“I made it,” said Joe, “my own self. I made it in a moment. It was like\\nstriking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so\\nmuch surprised in all my life,—couldn’t credit my own ed,—to tell you\\nthe truth, hardly believed it _were_ my own ed. As I was saying, Pip,\\nit were my intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costs\\nmoney, cut it how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Not\\nto mention bearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for\\nmy mother. She were in poor elth, and quite broke. She weren’t long of\\nfollowing, poor soul, and her share of peace come round at last.”\\n\\nJoe’s blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them,\\nand then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner,\\nwith the round knob on the top of the poker.\\n\\n“It were but lonesome then,” said Joe, “living here alone, and I got\\nacquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,”—Joe looked firmly at me as if\\nhe knew I was not going to agree with him;—“your sister is a fine\\nfigure of a woman.”\\n\\nI could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.\\n\\n“Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world’s opinions, on that\\nsubject may be, Pip, your sister is,” Joe tapped the top bar with the\\npoker after every word following, “a-fine-figure—of—a—woman!”\\n\\nI could think of nothing better to say than “I am glad you think so,\\nJoe.”\\n\\n“So am I,” returned Joe, catching me up. “_I_ am glad I think so, Pip.\\nA little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does\\nit signify to Me?”\\n\\nI sagaciously observed, if it didn’t signify to him, to whom did it\\nsignify?\\n\\n“Certainly!” assented Joe. “That’s it. You’re right, old chap! When I\\ngot acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringing\\nyou up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,\\nalong with all the folks. As to you,” Joe pursued with a countenance\\nexpressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, “if you could have\\nbeen aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you’d have\\nformed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!”\\n\\nNot exactly relishing this, I said, “Never mind me, Joe.”\\n\\n“But I did mind you, Pip,” he returned with tender simplicity. “When I\\noffered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at\\nsuch times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to\\nher, ‘And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little\\nchild,’ I said to your sister, ‘there’s room for _him_ at the forge!’”\\n\\nI broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:\\nwho dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, “Ever the best of friends;\\nan’t us, Pip? Don’t cry, old chap!”\\n\\nWhen this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:—\\n\\n“Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That’s about where it lights;\\nhere we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I\\ntell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn’t\\nsee too much of what we’re up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the\\nsly. And why on the sly? I’ll tell you why, Pip.”\\n\\nHe had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could\\nhave proceeded in his demonstration.\\n\\n“Your sister is given to government.”\\n\\n“Given to government, Joe?” I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea\\n(and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a\\nfavour of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.\\n\\n“Given to government,” said Joe. “Which I meantersay the government of\\nyou and myself.”\\n\\n“Oh!”\\n\\n“And she an’t over partial to having scholars on the premises,” Joe\\ncontinued, “and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a\\nscholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don’t you\\nsee?”\\n\\nI was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as “Why—”\\nwhen Joe stopped me.\\n\\n“Stay a bit. I know what you’re a-going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I\\ndon’t deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I\\ndon’t deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down\\nupon us heavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page,\\nPip,” Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, “candour\\ncompels fur to admit that she is a Buster.”\\n\\nJoe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital\\nBs.\\n\\n“Why don’t I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off,\\nPip?”\\n\\n“Yes, Joe.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he might\\nfeel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that\\nplacid occupation; “your sister’s a master-mind. A master-mind.”\\n\\n“What’s that?” I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But\\nJoe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely\\nstopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,\\n“Her.”\\n\\n“And I ain’t a master-mind,” Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,\\nand got back to his whisker. “And last of all, Pip,—and this I want to\\nsay very serious to you, old chap,—I see so much in my poor mother, of\\na woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never\\ngetting no peace in her mortal days, that I’m dead afeerd of going\\nwrong in the way of not doing what’s right by a woman, and I’d fur\\nrather of the two go wrong the t’other way, and be a little\\nill-conwenienced myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I\\nwish there warn’t no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it\\nall on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and\\nI hope you’ll overlook shortcomings.”\\n\\nYoung as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from\\nthat night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but,\\nafterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about\\nhim, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up\\nto Joe in my heart.\\n\\n“However,” said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; “here’s the\\nDutch-clock a-working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of ’em,\\nand she’s not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook’s mare mayn’t\\nhave set a forefoot on a piece o’ ice, and gone down.”\\n\\nMrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,\\nto assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a\\nwoman’s judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no\\nconfidences in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe\\nwas out on one of these expeditions.\\n\\nJoe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to\\nlisten for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew\\nkeenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of\\nlying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars,\\nand considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to\\nthem as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the\\nglittering multitude.\\n\\n“Here comes the mare,” said Joe, “ringing like a peal of bells!”\\n\\nThe sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as\\nshe came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out,\\nready for Mrs. Joe’s alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might\\nsee a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that\\nnothing might be out of its place. When we had completed these\\npreparations, they drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon\\nlanded, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with\\na cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air\\nin with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.\\n\\n“Now,” said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and\\nthrowing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,\\n“if this boy ain’t grateful this night, he never will be!”\\n\\nI looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly\\nuninformed why he ought to assume that expression.\\n\\n“It’s only to be hoped,” said my sister, “that he won’t be Pompeyed.\\nBut I have my fears.”\\n\\n“She ain’t in that line, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “She knows\\nbetter.”\\n\\nShe? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,\\n“She?” Joe looked at me, making the motion with _his_ lips and\\neyebrows, “She?” My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of\\nhis hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such\\noccasions, and looked at her.\\n\\n“Well?” said my sister, in her snappish way. “What are you staring at?\\nIs the house afire?”\\n\\n“—Which some individual,” Joe politely hinted, “mentioned—she.”\\n\\n“And she is a she, I suppose?” said my sister. “Unless you call Miss\\nHavisham a he. And I doubt if even you’ll go so far as that.”\\n\\n“Miss Havisham, up town?” said Joe.\\n\\n“Is there any Miss Havisham down town?” returned my sister.\\n\\n“She wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he’s going. And\\nhe had better play there,” said my sister, shaking her head at me as an\\nencouragement to be extremely light and sportive, “or I’ll work him.”\\n\\nI had heard of Miss Havisham up town,—everybody for miles round had\\nheard of Miss Havisham up town,—as an immensely rich and grim lady who\\nlived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who\\nled a life of seclusion.\\n\\n“Well to be sure!” said Joe, astounded. “I wonder how she come to know\\nPip!”\\n\\n“Noodle!” cried my sister. “Who said she knew him?”\\n\\n“—Which some individual,” Joe again politely hinted, “mentioned that\\nshe wanted him to go and play there.”\\n\\n“And couldn’t she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and\\nplay there? Isn’t it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be\\na tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes—we won’t say quarterly or\\nhalf-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you—but\\nsometimes—go there to pay his rent? And couldn’t she then ask Uncle\\nPumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there? And couldn’t\\nUncle Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for\\nus—though you may not think it, Joseph,” in a tone of the deepest\\nreproach, as if he were the most callous of nephews, “then mention this\\nboy, standing Prancing here”—which I solemnly declare I was not\\ndoing—“that I have for ever been a willing slave to?”\\n\\n“Good again!” cried Uncle Pumblechook. “Well put! Prettily pointed!\\nGood indeed! Now Joseph, you know the case.”\\n\\n“No, Joseph,” said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe\\napologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose,\\n“you do not yet—though you may not think it—know the case. You may\\nconsider that you do, but you do _not_, Joseph. For you do not know\\nthat Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell,\\nthis boy’s fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham’s, has\\noffered to take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and to\\nkeep him to-night, and to take him with his own hands to Miss\\nHavisham’s to-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!” cried my sister,\\ncasting off her bonnet in sudden desperation, “here I stand talking to\\nmere Mooncalfs, with Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching\\ncold at the door, and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair\\nof his head to the sole of his foot!”\\n\\nWith that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face\\nwas squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps\\nof water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and\\nthumped, and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside\\nmyself. (I may here remark that I suppose myself to be better\\nacquainted than any living authority, with the ridgy effect of a\\nwedding-ring, passing unsympathetically over the human countenance.)\\n\\nWhen my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the\\nstiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was\\ntrussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered\\nover to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the\\nSheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been\\ndying to make all along: “Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, but\\nespecially unto them which brought you up by hand!”\\n\\n“Good-bye, Joe!”\\n\\n“God bless you, Pip, old chap!”\\n\\nI had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what\\nwith soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart. But\\nthey twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the\\nquestions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham’s, and what\\non earth I was expected to play at.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VIII.\\n\\n\\nMr. Pumblechook’s premises in the High Street of the market town, were\\nof a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a\\ncornchandler and seedsman should be. It appeared to me that he must be\\na very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop;\\nand I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and\\nsaw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds\\nand bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and\\nbloom.\\n\\nIt was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this\\nspeculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in\\nan attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the\\nbedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my\\neyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity\\nbetween seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did\\nhis shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavour about the\\ncorduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and\\nflavour about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I\\nhardly knew which was which. The same opportunity served me for\\nnoticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by\\nlooking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact\\n_his_ business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to\\nget on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating\\nthe baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer,\\nwho stood at his door and yawned at the chemist. The watchmaker, always\\nporing over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye, and\\nalways inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through the\\nglass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the\\nHigh Street whose trade engaged his attention.\\n\\nMr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o’clock in the parlour\\nbehind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of\\nbread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered\\nMr. Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my\\nsister’s idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be\\nimparted to my diet,—besides giving me as much crumb as possible in\\ncombination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm\\nwater into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the\\nmilk out altogether,—his conversation consisted of nothing but\\narithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good-morning, he said,\\npompously, “Seven times nine, boy?” And how should _I_ be able to\\nanswer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! I\\nwas hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum\\nthat lasted all through the breakfast. “Seven?” “And four?” “And\\neight?” “And six?” “And two?” “And ten?” And so on. And after each\\nfigure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a\\nsup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing,\\nand eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression)\\na gorging and gormandizing manner.\\n\\nFor such reasons, I was very glad when ten o’clock came and we started\\nfor Miss Havisham’s; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the\\nmanner in which I should acquit myself under that lady’s roof. Within a\\nquarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham’s house, which was of old\\nbrick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the\\nwindows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were\\nrustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so\\nwe had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come to\\nopen it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.\\nPumblechook said, “And fourteen?” but I pretended not to hear him), and\\nsaw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing\\nwas going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long\\ntime.\\n\\nA window was raised, and a clear voice demanded “What name?” To which\\nmy conductor replied, “Pumblechook.” The voice returned, “Quite right,”\\nand the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the\\ncourt-yard, with keys in her hand.\\n\\n“This,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “is Pip.”\\n\\n“This is Pip, is it?” returned the young lady, who was very pretty and\\nseemed very proud; “come in, Pip.”\\n\\nMr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.\\n\\n“Oh!” she said. “Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?”\\n\\n“If Miss Havisham wished to see me,” returned Mr. Pumblechook,\\ndiscomfited.\\n\\n“Ah!” said the girl; “but you see she don’t.”\\n\\nShe said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.\\nPumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not\\nprotest. But he eyed me severely,—as if _I_ had done anything to\\nhim!—and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: “Boy! Let\\nyour behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up by\\nhand!” I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to\\npropound through the gate, “And sixteen?” But he didn’t.\\n\\nMy young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.\\nIt was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The\\nbrewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the\\nwooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood\\nopen, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.\\nThe cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and it\\nmade a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the\\nbrewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.\\n\\nShe saw me looking at it, and she said, “You could drink without hurt\\nall the strong beer that’s brewed there now, boy.”\\n\\n“I should think I could, miss,” said I, in a shy way.\\n\\n“Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;\\ndon’t you think so?”\\n\\n“It looks like it, miss.”\\n\\n“Not that anybody means to try,” she added, “for that’s all done with,\\nand the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong\\nbeer, there’s enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor\\nHouse.”\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“Is that the name of this house, miss?”\\n\\n“One of its names, boy.”\\n\\n“It has more than one, then, miss?”\\n\\n“One more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or\\nHebrew, or all three—or all one to me—for enough.”\\n\\n“Enough House,” said I; “that’s a curious name, miss.”\\n\\n“Yes,” she replied; “but it meant more than it said. It meant, when it\\nwas given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They\\nmust have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But\\ndon’t loiter, boy.”\\n\\nThough she called me “boy” so often, and with a carelessness that was\\nfar from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed much\\nolder than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and\\nself-possessed; and she was as scornful of me as if she had been\\none-and-twenty, and a queen.\\n\\nWe went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two\\nchains across it outside,—and the first thing I noticed was, that the\\npassages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.\\nShe took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,\\nand still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.\\n\\nAt last we came to the door of a room, and she said, “Go in.”\\n\\nI answered, more in shyness than politeness, “After you, miss.”\\n\\nTo this she returned: “Don’t be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.”\\nAnd scornfully walked away, and—what was worse—took the candle with\\nher.\\n\\nThis was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only\\nthing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told\\nfrom within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a\\npretty large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of\\ndaylight was to be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed\\nfrom the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite\\nunknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded\\nlooking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady’s\\ndressing-table.\\n\\nWhether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no\\nfine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an elbow\\nresting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the\\nstrangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.\\n\\nShe was dressed in rich materials,—satins, and lace, and silks,—all of\\nwhite. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent\\nfrom her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was\\nwhite. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and\\nsome other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid\\nthan the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.\\nShe had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,—the\\nother was on the table near her hand,—her veil was but half arranged,\\nher watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay\\nwith those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some\\nflowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the\\nlooking-glass.\\n\\nIt was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though\\nI saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I\\nsaw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been\\nwhite long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw\\nthat the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and\\nlike the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her\\nsunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure\\nof a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had\\nshrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly\\nwaxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage\\nlying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches\\nto see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of\\na vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to\\nhave dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if\\nI could.\\n\\n“Who is it?” said the lady at the table.\\n\\n“Pip, ma’am.”\\n\\n“Pip?”\\n\\n“Mr. Pumblechook’s boy, ma’am. Come—to play.”\\n\\n“Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close.”\\n\\nIt was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of\\nthe surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped\\nat twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at\\ntwenty minutes to nine.\\n\\n“Look at me,” said Miss Havisham. “You are not afraid of a woman who\\nhas never seen the sun since you were born?”\\n\\nI regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie\\ncomprehended in the answer “No.”\\n\\n“Do you know what I touch here?” she said, laying her hands, one upon\\nthe other, on her left side.\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am.” (It made me think of the young man.)\\n\\n“What do I touch?”\\n\\n“Your heart.”\\n\\n“Broken!”\\n\\nShe uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and\\nwith a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept\\nher hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if\\nthey were heavy.\\n\\n“I am tired,” said Miss Havisham. “I want diversion, and I have done\\nwith men and women. Play.”\\n\\nI think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she\\ncould hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the\\nwide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.\\n\\n“I sometimes have sick fancies,” she went on, “and I have a sick fancy\\nthat I want to see some play. There, there!” with an impatient movement\\nof the fingers of her right hand; “play, play, play!”\\n\\nFor a moment, with the fear of my sister’s working me before my eyes, I\\nhad a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed\\ncharacter of Mr. Pumblechook’s chaise-cart. But I felt myself so\\nunequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss\\nHavisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as\\nshe said, when we had taken a good look at each other,—\\n\\n“Are you sullen and obstinate?”\\n\\n“No, ma’am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can’t play just\\nnow. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so\\nI would do it if I could; but it’s so new here, and so strange, and so\\nfine,—and melancholy—.” I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had\\nalready said it, and we took another look at each other.\\n\\nBefore she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the\\ndress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in\\nthe looking-glass.\\n\\n“So new to him,” she muttered, “so old to me; so strange to him, so\\nfamiliar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.”\\n\\nAs she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she\\nwas still talking to herself, and kept quiet.\\n\\n“Call Estella,” she repeated, flashing a look at me. “You can do that.\\nCall Estella. At the door.”\\n\\nTo stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,\\nbawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor\\nresponsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name,\\nwas almost as bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, and\\nher light came along the dark passage like a star.\\n\\nMiss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the\\ntable, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her\\npretty brown hair. “Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it\\nwell. Let me see you play cards with this boy.”\\n\\n“With this boy? Why, he is a common labouring-boy!”\\n\\nI thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,—only it seemed so\\nunlikely,—“Well? You can break his heart.”\\n\\n“What do you play, boy?” asked Estella of myself, with the greatest\\ndisdain.\\n\\n“Nothing but beggar my neighbour, miss.”\\n\\n“Beggar him,” said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.\\n\\nIt was then I began to understand that everything in the room had\\nstopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that\\nMiss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had\\ntaken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the\\ndressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now\\nyellow, had never been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the\\nshoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now\\nyellow, had been trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything,\\nthis standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the\\nwithered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like\\ngrave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.\\n\\nSo she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and\\ntrimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew\\nnothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies\\nburied in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being\\ndistinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have\\nlooked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have\\nstruck her to dust.\\n\\n“He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!” said Estella with disdain,\\nbefore our first game was out. “And what coarse hands he has! And what\\nthick boots!”\\n\\nI had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to\\nconsider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so\\nstrong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.\\n\\nShe won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I\\nknew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for\\na stupid, clumsy labouring-boy.\\n\\n“You say nothing of her,” remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked\\non. “She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. What\\ndo you think of her?”\\n\\n“I don’t like to say,” I stammered.\\n\\n“Tell me in my ear,” said Miss Havisham, bending down.\\n\\n“I think she is very proud,” I replied, in a whisper.\\n\\n“Anything else?”\\n\\n“I think she is very pretty.”\\n\\n“Anything else?”\\n\\n“I think she is very insulting.” (She was looking at me then with a\\nlook of supreme aversion.)\\n\\n“Anything else?”\\n\\n“I think I should like to go home.”\\n\\n“And never see her again, though she is so pretty?”\\n\\n“I am not sure that I shouldn’t like to see her again, but I should\\nlike to go home now.”\\n\\n“You shall go soon,” said Miss Havisham, aloud. “Play the game out.”\\n\\nSaving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure\\nthat Miss Havisham’s face could not smile. It had dropped into a\\nwatchful and brooding expression,—most likely when all the things about\\nher had become transfixed,—and it looked as if nothing could ever lift\\nit up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice\\nhad dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;\\naltogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,\\nwithin and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.\\n\\nI played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. She\\nthrew the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she\\ndespised them for having been won of me.\\n\\n“When shall I have you here again?” said Miss Havisham. “Let me think.”\\n\\nI was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when she\\nchecked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her\\nright hand.\\n\\n“There, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of\\nweeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am.”\\n\\n“Estella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let him\\nroam and look about him while he eats. Go, Pip.”\\n\\nI followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she\\nstood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the side\\nentrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must\\nnecessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded\\nme, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange\\nroom many hours.\\n\\n“You are to wait here, you boy,” said Estella; and disappeared and\\nclosed the door.\\n\\nI took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my\\ncoarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was\\nnot favourable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled me\\nnow, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had ever\\ntaught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called\\nknaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and\\nthen I should have been so too.\\n\\nShe came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She\\nput the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and\\nmeat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in\\ndisgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,—I\\ncannot hit upon the right name for the smart—God knows what its name\\nwas,—that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the\\ngirl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of\\nthem. This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she\\ngave a contemptuous toss—but with a sense, I thought, of having made\\ntoo sure that I was so wounded—and left me.\\n\\nBut when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face\\nin, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my\\nsleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.\\nAs I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so\\nbitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name,\\nthat needed counteraction.\\n\\nMy sister’s bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in\\nwhich children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is\\nnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be\\nonly small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child is\\nsmall, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many\\nhands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within\\nmyself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with\\ninjustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my\\nsister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had\\ncherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave\\nher no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments,\\ndisgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had\\nnursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a\\nsolitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was\\nmorally timid and very sensitive.\\n\\nI got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the\\nbrewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my\\nface with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat\\nwere acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon\\nin spirits to look about me.\\n\\nTo be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the\\nbrewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high\\nwind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there\\nhad been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no\\npigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty,\\nno malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper\\nor the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might have\\nevaporated with its last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a\\nwilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of\\nbetter days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as\\na sample of the beer that was gone,—and in this respect I remember\\nthose recluses as being like most others.\\n\\nBehind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old\\nwall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough\\nto look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the\\nhouse, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was\\na track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes\\nwalked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But\\nshe seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation\\npresented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walking\\non them at the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me,\\nand held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never\\nlooked round, and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery\\nitself,—by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used\\nto make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were. When I\\nfirst went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the\\ndoor looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and\\nascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead,\\nas if she were going out into the sky.\\n\\nIt was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened\\nto my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a\\nstranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes—a little dimmed by\\nlooking up at the frosty light—towards a great wooden beam in a low\\nnook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure\\nhanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but one\\nshoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded\\ntrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was\\nMiss Havisham’s, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if\\nshe were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure, and\\nin the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment\\nbefore, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror\\nwas greatest of all when I found no figure there.\\n\\nNothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of\\npeople passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving\\ninfluence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have\\nbrought me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself\\nas soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to\\nlet me out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I\\nthought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.\\n\\nShe gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that\\nmy hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the\\ngate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her,\\nwhen she touched me with a taunting hand.\\n\\n“Why don’t you cry?”\\n\\n“Because I don’t want to.”\\n\\n“You do,” said she. “You have been crying till you are half blind, and\\nyou are near crying again now.”\\n\\nShe laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.\\nI went straight to Mr. Pumblechook’s, and was immensely relieved to\\nfind him not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I\\nwas wanted at Miss Havisham’s again, I set off on the four-mile walk to\\nour forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply\\nrevolving that I was a common labouring-boy; that my hands were coarse;\\nthat my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of\\ncalling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had\\nconsidered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived\\nbad way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IX.\\n\\n\\nWhen I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss\\nHavisham’s, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself\\ngetting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the\\nsmall of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the\\nkitchen wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient\\nlength.\\n\\nIf a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other\\nyoung people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden\\nin mine,—which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason to\\nsuspect myself of having been a monstrosity,—it is the key to many\\nreservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham’s as\\nmy eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I\\nfelt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and\\nalthough she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an\\nimpression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my\\ndragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before\\nthe contemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as I\\ncould, and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.\\n\\nThe worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by\\na devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came\\ngaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details\\ndivulged to him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes\\nand mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat\\nheaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.\\n\\n“Well, boy,” Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the\\nchair of honour by the fire. “How did you get on up town?”\\n\\nI answered, “Pretty well, sir,” and my sister shook her fist at me.\\n\\n“Pretty well?” Mr. Pumblechook repeated. “Pretty well is no answer.\\nTell us what you mean by pretty well, boy?”\\n\\nWhitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy\\nperhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my\\nobstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered\\nas if I had discovered a new idea, “I mean pretty well.”\\n\\nMy sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,—I\\nhad no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,—when Mr.\\nPumblechook interposed with “No! Don’t lose your temper. Leave this lad\\nto me, ma’am; leave this lad to me.” Mr. Pumblechook then turned me\\ntowards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,—\\n\\n“First (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?”\\n\\nI calculated the consequences of replying “Four Hundred Pound,” and\\nfinding them against me, went as near the answer as I could—which was\\nsomewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my\\npence-table from “twelve pence make one shilling,” up to “forty pence\\nmake three and fourpence,” and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had\\ndone for me, “_Now!_ How much is forty-three pence?” To which I\\nreplied, after a long interval of reflection, “I don’t know.” And I was\\nso aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.\\n\\nMr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me, and\\nsaid, “Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for\\ninstance?”\\n\\n“Yes!” said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was\\nhighly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and\\nbrought him to a dead stop.\\n\\n“Boy! What like is Miss Havisham?” Mr. Pumblechook began again when he\\nhad recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the\\nscrew.\\n\\n“Very tall and dark,” I told him.\\n\\n“Is she, uncle?” asked my sister.\\n\\nMr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he\\nhad never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.\\n\\n“Good!” said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. (“This is the way to have\\nhim! We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?”)\\n\\n“I am sure, uncle,” returned Mrs. Joe, “I wish you had him always; you\\nknow so well how to deal with him.”\\n\\n“Now, boy! What was she a-doing of, when you went in today?” asked Mr.\\nPumblechook.\\n\\n“She was sitting,” I answered, “in a black velvet coach.”\\n\\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another—as they well\\nmight—and both repeated, “In a black velvet coach?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said I. “And Miss Estella—that’s her niece, I think—handed her\\nin cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had\\ncake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat\\nmine, because she told me to.”\\n\\n“Was anybody else there?” asked Mr. Pumblechook.\\n\\n“Four dogs,” said I.\\n\\n“Large or small?”\\n\\n“Immense,” said I. “And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver\\nbasket.”\\n\\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter\\namazement. I was perfectly frantic,—a reckless witness under the\\ntorture,—and would have told them anything.\\n\\n“Where _was_ this coach, in the name of gracious?” asked my sister.\\n\\n“In Miss Havisham’s room.” They stared again. “But there weren’t any\\nhorses to it.” I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting\\nfour richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of\\nharnessing.\\n\\n“Can this be possible, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe. “What can the boy mean?”\\n\\n“I’ll tell you, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “My opinion is, it’s a\\nsedan-chair. She’s flighty, you know,—very flighty,—quite flighty\\nenough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.”\\n\\n“Did you ever see her in it, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe.\\n\\n“How could I,” he returned, forced to the admission, “when I never see\\nher in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!”\\n\\n“Goodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?”\\n\\n“Why, don’t you know,” said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, “that when I have\\nbeen there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the\\ndoor has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don’t say you\\ndon’t know _that_, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did\\nyou play at, boy?”\\n\\n“We played with flags,” I said. (I beg to observe that I think of\\nmyself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)\\n\\n“Flags!” echoed my sister.\\n\\n“Yes,” said I. “Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and\\nMiss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out\\nat the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.”\\n\\n“Swords!” repeated my sister. “Where did you get swords from?”\\n\\n“Out of a cupboard,” said I. “And I saw pistols in it,—and jam,—and\\npills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up\\nwith candles.”\\n\\n“That’s true, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. “That’s the\\nstate of the case, for that much I’ve seen myself.” And then they both\\nstared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my\\ncountenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers\\nwith my right hand.\\n\\nIf they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have\\nbetrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that\\nthere was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement\\nbut for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear\\nin the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the\\nmarvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I\\nescaped. The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to\\nhave a cup of tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own\\nmind than for the gratification of his, related my pretended\\nexperiences.\\n\\nNow, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the\\nkitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only\\nas regarded him,—not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards\\nJoe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat\\ndebating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham’s\\nacquaintance and favour. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would “do\\nsomething” for me; their doubts related to the form that something\\nwould take. My sister stood out for “property.” Mr. Pumblechook was in\\nfavour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel\\ntrade,—say, the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the\\ndeepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I\\nmight only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the\\nveal-cutlets. “If a fool’s head can’t express better opinions than\\nthat,” said my sister, “and you have got any work to do, you had better\\ngo and do it.” So he went.\\n\\nAfter Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing\\nup, I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had\\ndone for the night. Then I said, “Before the fire goes out, Joe, I\\nshould like to tell you something.”\\n\\n“Should you, Pip?” said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.\\n“Then tell us. What is it, Pip?”\\n\\n“Joe,” said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting\\nit between my finger and thumb, “you remember all that about Miss\\nHavisham’s?”\\n\\n“Remember?” said Joe. “I believe you! Wonderful!”\\n\\n“It’s a terrible thing, Joe; it ain’t true.”\\n\\n“What are you telling of, Pip?” cried Joe, falling back in the greatest\\namazement. “You don’t mean to say it’s—”\\n\\n“Yes I do; it’s lies, Joe.”\\n\\n“But not all of it? Why sure you don’t mean to say, Pip, that there was\\nno black welwet co—eh?” For, I stood shaking my head. “But at least\\nthere was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,” said Joe, persuasively, “if there\\nwarn’t no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?”\\n\\n“No, Joe.”\\n\\n“A dog?” said Joe. “A puppy? Come?”\\n\\n“No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.”\\n\\nAs I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.\\n“Pip, old chap! This won’t do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect\\nto go to?”\\n\\n“It’s terrible, Joe; ain’t it?”\\n\\n“Terrible?” cried Joe. “Awful! What possessed you?”\\n\\n“I don’t know what possessed me, Joe,” I replied, letting his shirt\\nsleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;\\n“but I wish you hadn’t taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I\\nwish my boots weren’t so thick nor my hands so coarse.”\\n\\nAnd then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn’t been\\nable to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to\\nme, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’s\\nwho was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that\\nI knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the\\nlies had come of it somehow, though I didn’t know how.\\n\\nThis was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal\\nwith as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of\\nmetaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.\\n\\n“There’s one thing you may be sure of, Pip,” said Joe, after some\\nrumination, “namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn’t\\nought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to\\nthe same. Don’t you tell no more of ’em, Pip. _That_ ain’t the way to\\nget out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don’t make\\nit out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You’re oncommon\\nsmall. Likewise you’re a oncommon scholar.”\\n\\n“No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.”\\n\\n“Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I’ve\\nseen letters—Ah! and from gentlefolks!—that I’ll swear weren’t wrote in\\nprint,” said Joe.\\n\\n“I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It’s only\\nthat.”\\n\\n“Well, Pip,” said Joe, “be it so or be it son’t, you must be a common\\nscholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon\\nhis throne, with his crown upon his ed, can’t sit and write his acts of\\nParliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted\\nPrince, with the alphabet.—Ah!” added Joe, with a shake of the head\\nthat was full of meaning, “and begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.\\nAnd _I_ know what that is to do, though I can’t say I’ve exactly done\\nit.”\\n\\nThere was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged\\nme.\\n\\n“Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,” pursued Joe,\\nreflectively, “mightn’t be the better of continuing for to keep company\\nwith common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon\\nones,—which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?”\\n\\n“No, Joe.”\\n\\n“(I’m sorry there weren’t a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or\\nmightn’t be, is a thing as can’t be looked into now, without putting\\nyour sister on the Rampage; and that’s a thing not to be thought of as\\nbeing done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a\\ntrue friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can’t get to\\nbe oncommon through going straight, you’ll never get to do it through\\ngoing crooked. So don’t tell no more on ’em, Pip, and live well and die\\nhappy.”\\n\\n“You are not angry with me, Joe?”\\n\\n“No, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of\\na stunning and outdacious sort,—alluding to them which bordered on\\nweal-cutlets and dog-fighting,—a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,\\ntheir being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.\\nThat’s all, old chap, and don’t never do it no more.”\\n\\nWhen I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget\\nJoe’s recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and\\nunthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common\\nEstella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his boots, and\\nhow coarse his hands. I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting\\nin the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how\\nMiss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above\\nthe level of such common doings. I fell asleep recalling what I “used\\nto do” when I was at Miss Havisham’s; as though I had been there weeks\\nor months, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject\\nof remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.\\n\\nThat was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it\\nis the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it,\\nand think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read\\nthis, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of\\nthorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the\\nformation of the first link on one memorable day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter X.\\n\\n\\nThe felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,\\nthat the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to\\nget out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous\\nconception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle’s\\ngreat-aunt’s at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to\\nget on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she\\nwould impart all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging\\nof girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her\\npromise within five minutes.\\n\\nThe Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt\\nmay be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and\\nput straws down one another’s backs, until Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt\\ncollected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with\\na birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,\\nthe pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand\\nto hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a\\nlittle spelling,—that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this\\nvolume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt fell into a state of\\ncoma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils\\nthen entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the\\nsubject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the\\nhardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a\\nrush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they\\nhad been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more\\nillegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have\\nsince met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various\\nspecimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This part\\nof the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between\\nBiddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave\\nout the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,—or\\nwhat we couldn’t—in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,\\nshrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or\\nreverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had\\nlasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt,\\nwho staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was\\nunderstood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into\\nthe air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that\\nthere was no prohibition against any pupil’s entertaining himself with\\na slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not\\neasy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of\\nthe little general shop in which the classes were holden—and which was\\nalso Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s sitting-room and bedchamber—being but\\nfaintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle\\nand no snuffers.\\n\\nIt appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under\\nthese circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very\\nevening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some\\ninformation from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of\\nmoist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D\\nwhich she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I\\nsupposed, until she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.\\n\\nOf course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe\\nliked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders\\nfrom my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that\\nevening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the\\nThree Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.\\n\\nThere was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk\\nscores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to\\nbe never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and\\nhad grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our\\ncountry, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it\\nto account.\\n\\nIt being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly at\\nthese records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I\\nmerely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the\\nend of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, and\\nwhere Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a\\nstranger. Joe greeted me as usual with “Halloa, Pip, old chap!” and the\\nmoment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.\\n\\nHe was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was\\nall on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were\\ntaking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his\\nmouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away\\nand looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he\\nnodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit\\ndown there.\\n\\nBut as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of\\nresort, I said “No, thank you, sir,” and fell into the space Joe made\\nfor me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,\\nand seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again\\nwhen I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg—in a very odd way, as\\nit struck me.\\n\\n“You was saying,” said the strange man, turning to Joe, “that you was a\\nblacksmith.”\\n\\n“Yes. I said it, you know,” said Joe.\\n\\n“What’ll you drink, Mr.—? You didn’t mention your name, by the bye.”\\n\\nJoe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. “What’ll\\nyou drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?”\\n\\n“Well,” said Joe, “to tell you the truth, I ain’t much in the habit of\\ndrinking at anybody’s expense but my own.”\\n\\n“Habit? No,” returned the stranger, “but once and away, and on a\\nSaturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.”\\n\\n“I wouldn’t wish to be stiff company,” said Joe. “Rum.”\\n\\n“Rum,” repeated the stranger. “And will the other gentleman originate a\\nsentiment.”\\n\\n“Rum,” said Mr. Wopsle.\\n\\n“Three Rums!” cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. “Glasses\\nround!”\\n\\n“This other gentleman,” observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,\\n“is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at\\nchurch.”\\n\\n“Aha!” said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. “The\\nlonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!”\\n\\n“That’s it,” said Joe.\\n\\nThe stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put his\\nlegs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping\\nbroad-brimmed traveller’s hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over\\nhis head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he\\nlooked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a\\nhalf-laugh, come into his face.\\n\\n“I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a\\nsolitary country towards the river.”\\n\\n“Most marshes is solitary,” said Joe.\\n\\n“No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or\\nvagrants of any sort, out there?”\\n\\n“No,” said Joe; “none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don’t\\nfind _them_, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?”\\n\\nMr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;\\nbut not warmly.\\n\\n“Seems you have been out after such?” asked the stranger.\\n\\n“Once,” returned Joe. “Not that we wanted to take them, you understand;\\nwe went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn’t us,\\nPip?”\\n\\n“Yes, Joe.”\\n\\nThe stranger looked at me again,—still cocking his eye, as if he were\\nexpressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,—and said, “He’s a\\nlikely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?”\\n\\n“Pip,” said Joe.\\n\\n“Christened Pip?”\\n\\n“No, not christened Pip.”\\n\\n“Surname Pip?”\\n\\n“No,” said Joe, “it’s a kind of family name what he gave himself when a\\ninfant, and is called by.”\\n\\n“Son of yours?”\\n\\n“Well,” said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in\\nanywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at\\nthe Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was\\ndiscussed over pipes,—“well—no. No, he ain’t.”\\n\\n“Nevvy?” said the strange man.\\n\\n“Well,” said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, “he\\nis not—no, not to deceive you, he is _not_—my nevvy.”\\n\\n“What the Blue Blazes is he?” asked the stranger. Which appeared to me\\nto be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.\\n\\nMr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about\\nrelationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female\\nrelations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and\\nJoe. Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most\\nterrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to\\nthink he had done quite enough to account for it when he added, “—as\\nthe poet says.”\\n\\nAnd here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he\\nconsidered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and\\npoke it into my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing\\nwho visited at our house should always have put me through the same\\ninflammatory process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to\\nmind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our\\nsocial family circle, but some large-handed person took some such\\nophthalmic steps to patronise me.\\n\\nAll this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at\\nme as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me\\ndown. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,\\nuntil the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his\\nshot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.\\n\\nIt was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was\\npointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at\\nme, and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it\\nand he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but _with a\\nfile_.\\n\\nHe did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it\\nhe wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe’s\\nfile, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the\\ninstrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on\\nhis settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally\\nabout turnips.\\n\\nThere was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause\\nbefore going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights,\\nwhich stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on\\nSaturdays than at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water\\nrunning out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.\\n\\n“Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,” said the strange man. “I think I’ve\\ngot a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the\\nboy shall have it.”\\n\\nHe looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some\\ncrumpled paper, and gave it to me. “Yours!” said he. “Mind! Your own.”\\n\\nI thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,\\nand holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr.\\nWopsle good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look\\nwith his aiming eye,—no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may\\nbe done with an eye by hiding it.\\n\\nOn the way home, if I had been in a humour for talking, the talk must\\nhave been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of\\nthe Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide\\nopen, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in a\\nmanner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old\\nacquaintance, and could think of nothing else.\\n\\nMy sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in\\nthe kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to\\ntell her about the bright shilling. “A bad un, I’ll be bound,” said\\nMrs. Joe triumphantly, “or he wouldn’t have given it to the boy! Let’s\\nlook at it.”\\n\\nI took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. “But what’s\\nthis?” said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the\\npaper. “Two One-Pound notes?”\\n\\nNothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to\\nhave been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets\\nin the county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the\\nJolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I sat\\ndown on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty\\nsure that the man would not be there.\\n\\nPresently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,\\nJoe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.\\nThen my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under\\nsome dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in\\nthe state parlour. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and\\nmany a night and day.\\n\\nI had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the\\nstrange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the\\nguiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of\\nconspiracy with convicts,—a feature in my low career that I had\\npreviously forgotten. I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed\\nme that when I least expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed\\nmyself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham’s, next Wednesday; and in\\nmy sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who\\nheld it, and I screamed myself awake.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XI.\\n\\n\\nAt the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham’s, and my hesitating\\nring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting me,\\nas she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage\\nwhere her candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had the\\ncandle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously\\nsaying, “You are to come this way to-day,” and took me to quite another\\npart of the house.\\n\\nThe passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square\\nbasement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,\\nhowever, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and\\nopened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in a\\nsmall paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a\\ndetached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the\\nmanager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the\\nouter wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham’s room, and\\nlike Miss Havisham’s watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.\\n\\nWe went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a\\nlow ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in\\nthe room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, “You are to go and\\nstand there boy, till you are wanted.” “There”, being the window, I\\ncrossed to it, and stood “there,” in a very uncomfortable state of\\nmind, looking out.\\n\\nIt opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the\\nneglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree\\nthat had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new\\ngrowth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different colour, as if\\nthat part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This\\nwas my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been\\nsome light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;\\nbut, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of\\ngarden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the\\nwindow, as if it pelted me for coming there.\\n\\nI divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that\\nits other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room\\nexcept the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in\\nall my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.\\n\\nThere were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had\\nbeen standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me\\nthat they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended\\nnot to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the\\nadmission that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to\\nbe a toady and humbug.\\n\\nThey all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody’s pleasure,\\nand the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to\\nrepress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded\\nme of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I\\nfound when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.\\nIndeed, when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had\\nany features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her\\nface.\\n\\n“Poor dear soul!” said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my\\nsister’s. “Nobody’s enemy but his own!”\\n\\n“It would be much more commendable to be somebody else’s enemy,” said\\nthe gentleman; “far more natural.”\\n\\n“Cousin Raymond,” observed another lady, “we are to love our\\nneighbour.”\\n\\n“Sarah Pocket,” returned Cousin Raymond, “if a man is not his own\\nneighbour, who is?”\\n\\nMiss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),\\n“The idea!” But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea\\ntoo. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and\\nemphatically, “_Very_ true!”\\n\\n“Poor soul!” Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been\\nlooking at me in the mean time), “he is so very strange! Would anyone\\nbelieve that when Tom’s wife died, he actually could not be induced to\\nsee the importance of the children’s having the deepest of trimmings to\\ntheir mourning? ‘Good Lord!’ says he, ‘Camilla, what can it signify so\\nlong as the poor bereaved little things are in black?’ So like Matthew!\\nThe idea!”\\n\\n“Good points in him, good points in him,” said Cousin Raymond; “Heaven\\nforbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never\\nwill have, any sense of the proprieties.”\\n\\n“You know I was obliged,” said Camilla,—“I was obliged to be firm. I\\nsaid, ‘It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.’ I told him that,\\nwithout deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from\\nbreakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out\\nin his violent way, and said, with a D, ‘Then do as you like.’ Thank\\nGoodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly\\nwent out in a pouring rain and bought the things.”\\n\\n“_He_ paid for them, did he not?” asked Estella.\\n\\n“It’s not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,” returned\\nCamilla. “_I_ bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,\\nwhen I wake up in the night.”\\n\\nThe ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or\\ncall along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the\\nconversation and caused Estella to say to me, “Now, boy!” On my turning\\nround, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went\\nout, I heard Sarah Pocket say, “Well I am sure! What next!” and Camilla\\nadd, with indignation, “Was there ever such a fancy! The i-d_e_-a!”\\n\\nAs we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella\\nstopped all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting\\nmanner, with her face quite close to mine,—\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“Well, miss?” I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.\\n\\nShe stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.\\n\\n“Am I pretty?”\\n\\n“Yes; I think you are very pretty.”\\n\\n“Am I insulting?”\\n\\n“Not so much so as you were last time,” said I.\\n\\n“Not so much so?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\nShe fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my face\\nwith such force as she had, when I answered it.\\n\\n“Now?” said she. “You little coarse monster, what do you think of me\\nnow?”\\n\\n“I shall not tell you.”\\n\\n“Because you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?”\\n\\n“No,” said I, “that’s not it.”\\n\\n“Why don’t you cry again, you little wretch?”\\n\\n“Because I’ll never cry for you again,” said I. Which was, I suppose,\\nas false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for\\nher then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.\\n\\nWe went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going\\nup, we met a gentleman groping his way down.\\n\\n“Whom have we here?” asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.\\n\\n“A boy,” said Estella.\\n\\nHe was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an\\nexceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. He took my chin\\nin his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the\\nlight of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head,\\nand had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn’t lie down but stood up\\nbristling. His eyes were set very deep in his head, and were\\ndisagreeably sharp and suspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and\\nstrong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he\\nhad let them. He was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresight\\nthen, that he ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I had\\nthis opportunity of observing him well.\\n\\n“Boy of the neighbourhood? Hey?” said he.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said I.\\n\\n“How do _you_ come here?”\\n\\n“Miss Havisham sent for me, sir,” I explained.\\n\\n“Well! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and\\nyou’re a bad set of fellows. Now mind!” said he, biting the side of his\\ngreat forefinger as he frowned at me, “you behave yourself!”\\n\\nWith those words, he released me—which I was glad of, for his hand\\nsmelt of scented soap—and went his way downstairs. I wondered whether\\nhe could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn’t be a doctor, or he\\nwould have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much\\ntime to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham’s room,\\nwhere she and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella\\nleft me standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham\\ncast her eyes upon me from the dressing-table.\\n\\n“So!” she said, without being startled or surprised: “the days have\\nworn away, have they?”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am. To-day is—”\\n\\n“There, there, there!” with the impatient movement of her fingers. “I\\ndon’t want to know. Are you ready to play?”\\n\\nI was obliged to answer in some confusion, “I don’t think I am, ma’am.”\\n\\n“Not at cards again?” she demanded, with a searching look.\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am; I could do that, if I was wanted.”\\n\\n“Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy,” said Miss Havisham,\\nimpatiently, “and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?”\\n\\nI could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to\\nfind for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.\\n\\n“Then go into that opposite room,” said she, pointing at the door\\nbehind me with her withered hand, “and wait there till I come.”\\n\\nI crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.\\nFrom that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had\\nan airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in\\nthe damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than\\nto burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed\\ncolder than the clearer air,—like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry\\nbranches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the\\nchamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its\\ndarkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but\\nevery discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and\\ndropping to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with a\\ntablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the\\nhouse and the clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece\\nof some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily\\noverhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and,\\nas I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its\\nseeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with\\nblotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some\\ncircumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in\\nthe spider community.\\n\\nI heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same\\noccurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles\\ntook no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a\\nponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of\\nhearing, and not on terms with one another.\\n\\nThese crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching\\nthem from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.\\nIn her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned,\\nand she looked like the Witch of the place.\\n\\n“This,” said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, “is where\\nI will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.”\\n\\nWith some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and\\nthere and die at once, the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork\\nat the Fair, I shrank under her touch.\\n\\n“What do you think that is?” she asked me, again pointing with her\\nstick; “that, where those cobwebs are?”\\n\\n“I can’t guess what it is, ma’am.”\\n\\n“It’s a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!”\\n\\nShe looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,\\nleaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, “Come, come, come!\\nWalk me, walk me!”\\n\\nI made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss\\nHavisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and\\nshe leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have\\nbeen an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.\\nPumblechook’s chaise-cart.\\n\\nShe was not physically strong, and after a little time said, “Slower!”\\nStill, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she\\ntwitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to\\nbelieve that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a\\nwhile she said, “Call Estella!” so I went out on the landing and roared\\nthat name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light\\nappeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round\\nand round the room.\\n\\nIf only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should\\nhave felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the\\nthree ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn’t know\\nwhat to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss Havisham\\ntwitched my shoulder, and we posted on,—with a shame-faced\\nconsciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.\\n\\n“Dear Miss Havisham,” said Miss Sarah Pocket. “How well you look!”\\n\\n“I do not,” returned Miss Havisham. “I am yellow skin and bone.”\\n\\nCamilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she\\nmurmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, “Poor dear\\nsoul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!”\\n\\n“And how are _you_?” said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to\\nCamilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss\\nHavisham wouldn’t stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly\\nobnoxious to Camilla.\\n\\n“Thank you, Miss Havisham,” she returned, “I am as well as can be\\nexpected.”\\n\\n“Why, what’s the matter with you?” asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding\\nsharpness.\\n\\n“Nothing worth mentioning,” replied Camilla. “I don’t wish to make a\\ndisplay of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in\\nthe night than I am quite equal to.”\\n\\n“Then don’t think of me,” retorted Miss Havisham.\\n\\n“Very easily said!” remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a\\nhitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. “Raymond is a\\nwitness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.\\nRaymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings\\nand nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with\\nanxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,\\nI should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure I\\nwish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night—The\\nidea!” Here, a burst of tears.\\n\\nThe Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and\\nhim I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this\\npoint, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, “Camilla, my\\ndear, it is well known that your family feelings are gradually\\nundermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than\\nthe other.”\\n\\n“I am not aware,” observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but\\nonce, “that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that\\nperson, my dear.”\\n\\nMiss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated\\nold woman, with a small face that might have been made of\\nwalnut-shells, and a large mouth like a cat’s without the whiskers,\\nsupported this position by saying, “No, indeed, my dear. Hem!”\\n\\n“Thinking is easy enough,” said the grave lady.\\n\\n“What is easier, you know?” assented Miss Sarah Pocket.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, yes!” cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to\\nrise from her legs to her bosom. “It’s all very true! It’s a weakness\\nto be so affectionate, but I can’t help it. No doubt my health would be\\nmuch better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn’t change my disposition\\nif I could. It’s the cause of much suffering, but it’s a consolation to\\nknow I posses it, when I wake up in the night.” Here another burst of\\nfeeling.\\n\\nMiss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going\\nround and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the\\nvisitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.\\n\\n“There’s Matthew!” said Camilla. “Never mixing with any natural ties,\\nnever coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa\\nwith my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my\\nhead over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don’t know\\nwhere—”\\n\\n(“Much higher than your head, my love,” said Mr. Camilla.)\\n\\n“I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of\\nMatthew’s strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.”\\n\\n“Really I must say I should think not!” interposed the grave lady.\\n\\n“You see, my dear,” added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious\\npersonage), “the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to\\nthank you, my love?”\\n\\n“Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,” resumed\\nCamilla, “I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond\\nis a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total\\ninefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte\\ntuner’s across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even\\nsupposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,—and now to be told—”\\nHere Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemical\\nas to the formation of new combinations there.\\n\\nWhen this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and\\nherself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great\\ninfluence in bringing Camilla’s chemistry to a sudden end.\\n\\n“Matthew will come and see me at last,” said Miss Havisham, sternly,\\n“when I am laid on that table. That will be his place,—there,” striking\\nthe table with her stick, “at my head! And yours will be there! And\\nyour husband’s there! And Sarah Pocket’s there! And Georgiana’s there!\\nNow you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast\\nupon me. And now go!”\\n\\nAt the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick in\\na new place. She now said, “Walk me, walk me!” and we went on again.\\n\\n“I suppose there’s nothing to be done,” exclaimed Camilla, “but comply\\nand depart. It’s something to have seen the object of one’s love and\\nduty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy\\nsatisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could have\\nthat comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a\\ndisplay of my feelings, but it’s very hard to be told one wants to\\nfeast on one’s relations,—as if one was a Giant,—and to be told to go.\\nThe bare idea!”\\n\\nMr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving\\nbosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I\\nsupposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of\\nview, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah\\nPocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was\\ntoo knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful\\nslipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sarah\\nPocket then made her separate effect of departing with, “Bless you,\\nMiss Havisham dear!” and with a smile of forgiving pity on her\\nwalnut-shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest.\\n\\nWhile Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked\\nwith her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she\\nstopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it\\nsome seconds,—\\n\\n“This is my birthday, Pip.”\\n\\nI was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.\\n\\n“I don’t suffer it to be spoken of. I don’t suffer those who were here\\njust now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but\\nthey dare not refer to it.”\\n\\nOf course _I_ made no further effort to refer to it.\\n\\n“On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of\\ndecay,” stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the\\ntable, but not touching it, “was brought here. It and I have worn away\\ntogether. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of\\nmice have gnawed at me.”\\n\\nShe held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking\\nat the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; the\\nonce white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state\\nto crumble under a touch.\\n\\n“When the ruin is complete,” said she, with a ghastly look, “and when\\nthey lay me dead, in my bride’s dress on the bride’s table,—which shall\\nbe done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,—so much the\\nbetter if it is done on this day!”\\n\\nShe stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own\\nfigure lying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she too\\nremained quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time.\\nIn the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in\\nits remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I\\nmight presently begin to decay.\\n\\nAt length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an\\ninstant, Miss Havisham said, “Let me see you two play cards; why have\\nyou not begun?” With that, we returned to her room, and sat down as\\nbefore; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham\\nwatched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella’s beauty, and\\nmade me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella’s breast and\\nhair.\\n\\nEstella, for her part, likewise treated me as before, except that she\\ndid not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games,\\na day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard\\nto be fed in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again left\\nto wander about as I liked.\\n\\nIt is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which\\nI had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last\\noccasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I saw\\none now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let the\\nvisitors out,—for she had returned with the keys in her hand,—I\\nstrolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a\\nwilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,\\nwhich seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of\\nweak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a\\nweedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.\\n\\nWhen I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but\\na fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal\\ncorner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for\\na moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window,\\nand found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a\\npale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.\\n\\nThis pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside\\nme. He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him,\\nand I now saw that he was inky.\\n\\n“Halloa!” said he, “young fellow!”\\n\\nHalloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be\\nbest answered by itself, _I_ said, “Halloa!” politely omitting young\\nfellow.\\n\\n“Who let _you_ in?” said he.\\n\\n“Miss Estella.”\\n\\n“Who gave you leave to prowl about?”\\n\\n“Miss Estella.”\\n\\n“Come and fight,” said the pale young gentleman.\\n\\nWhat could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question\\nsince; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was so\\nastonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a\\nspell.\\n\\n“Stop a minute, though,” he said, wheeling round before we had gone\\nmany paces. “I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it\\nis!” In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against\\none another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my\\nhair, slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my\\nstomach.\\n\\nThe bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was\\nunquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was\\nparticularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit\\nout at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, “Aha! Would\\nyou?” and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite\\nunparalleled within my limited experience.\\n\\n“Laws of the game!” said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to\\nhis right. “Regular rules!” Here, he skipped from his right leg on to\\nhis left. “Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!” Here,\\nhe dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I\\nlooked helplessly at him.\\n\\nI was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt\\nmorally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have\\nhad no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to\\nconsider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I\\nfollowed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by\\nthe junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking\\nme if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he\\nbegged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned\\nwith a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. “Available for\\nboth,” he said, placing these against the wall. And then fell to\\npulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a\\nmanner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.\\n\\nAlthough he did not look very healthy,—having pimples on his face, and\\na breaking out at his mouth,—these dreadful preparations quite appalled\\nme. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he\\nhad a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For\\nthe rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit (when not denuded for\\nbattle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in\\nadvance of the rest of him as to development.\\n\\nMy heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every\\ndemonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were\\nminutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,\\nas I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back,\\nlooking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly\\nfore-shortened.\\n\\nBut, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with a\\ngreat show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest\\nsurprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,\\nlooking up at me out of a black eye.\\n\\nHis spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no\\nstrength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked\\ndown; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or\\ndrinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in\\nseconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air\\nand a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at\\nlast. He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I\\nhit him, the harder I hit him; but he came up again and again and\\nagain, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head\\nagainst the wall. Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up and\\nturned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was;\\nbut finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at the\\nsame time panting out, “That means you have won.”\\n\\nHe seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the\\ncontest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go\\nso far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of\\nsavage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly\\nwiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, “Can I help you?”\\nand he said “No thankee,” and I said “Good afternoon,” and _he_ said\\n“Same to you.”\\n\\nWhen I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.\\nBut she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her\\nwaiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though\\nsomething had happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to the\\ngate, too, she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.\\n\\n“Come here! You may kiss me, if you like.”\\n\\nI kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone\\nthrough a great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was\\ngiven to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and\\nthat it was worth nothing.\\n\\nWhat with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with\\nthe fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the\\nlight on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming\\nagainst a black night-sky, and Joe’s furnace was flinging a path of\\nfire across the road.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XII.\\n\\n\\nMy mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman.\\nThe more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman\\non his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the\\nmore certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt\\nthat the pale young gentleman’s blood was on my head, and that the Law\\nwould avenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I\\nhad incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go\\nstalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and\\npitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselves\\nopen to severe punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home,\\nand looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and\\ntrepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the County\\nJail should pounce upon me. The pale young gentleman’s nose had stained\\nmy trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the\\ndead of night. I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman’s\\nteeth, and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as I\\ndevised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance\\nwhen I should be haled before the Judges.\\n\\nWhen the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of\\nviolence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of\\nJustice, especially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush\\nbehind the gate;—whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal\\nvengeance for an outrage done to her house, might rise in those\\ngrave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:—whether\\nsuborned boys—a numerous band of mercenaries—might be engaged to fall\\nupon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more;—it was high\\ntestimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman,\\nthat I never imagined _him_ accessory to these retaliations; they\\nalways came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his,\\ngoaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the\\nfamily features.\\n\\nHowever, go to Miss Havisham’s I must, and go I did. And behold!\\nnothing came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way,\\nand no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I\\nfound the same gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in\\nat the windows of the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped\\nby the closed shutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner\\nwhere the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the\\nyoung gentleman’s existence. There were traces of his gore in that\\nspot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.\\n\\nOn the broad landing between Miss Havisham’s own room and that other\\nroom in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,—a\\nlight chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed\\nthere since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular\\noccupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired\\nof walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and\\nacross the landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over\\nagain, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as\\nlong as three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general\\nmention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled\\nthat I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes,\\nand because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten\\nmonths.\\n\\nAs we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more\\nto me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I\\ngoing to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I\\nbelieved; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know\\neverything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that\\ndesirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer\\nmy being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,—or anything\\nbut my daily dinner,—nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my\\nservices.\\n\\nEstella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told\\nme I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;\\nsometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite\\nfamiliar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she\\nhated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we\\nwere alone, “Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?” And when I said\\nyes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when\\nwe played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish\\nof Estella’s moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods\\nwere so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled\\nwhat to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish\\nfondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like “Break their\\nhearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!”\\n\\nThere was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which\\nthe burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of\\nrendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in\\nthat relation towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure\\nof beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the\\nintroduction of Old Clem’s respected name. Thus, you were to hammer\\nboys round—Old Clem! With a thump and a sound—Old Clem! Beat it out,\\nbeat it out—Old Clem! With a clink for the stout—Old Clem! Blow the\\nfire, blow the fire—Old Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher—Old Clem!\\nOne day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly\\nsaying to me, with the impatient movement of her fingers, “There,\\nthere, there! Sing!” I was surprised into crooning this ditty as I\\npushed her over the floor. It happened so to catch her fancy that she\\ntook it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep.\\nAfter that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about,\\nand Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was so\\nsubdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise in\\nthe grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.\\n\\nWhat could I become with these surroundings? How could my character\\nfail to be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts\\nwere dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light\\nfrom the misty yellow rooms?\\n\\nPerhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had\\nnot previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I\\nhad confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly\\nfail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger\\nto be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of\\nhim. Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella\\ndiscussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more\\npotent as time went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but\\nBiddy; but I told poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to\\ndo so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her, I did\\nnot know then, though I think I know now.\\n\\nMeanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almost\\ninsupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,\\nPumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of\\ndiscussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to\\nthis hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these\\nhands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would\\nhave done it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of\\nmind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before\\nhim,—as it were, to operate upon,—and he would drag me up from my stool\\n(usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me\\nbefore the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying,\\n“Now, Mum, here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by\\nhand. Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which\\nso did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!” And then he would\\nrumple my hair the wrong way,—which from my earliest remembrance, as\\nalready hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of any\\nfellow-creature to do,—and would hold me before him by the sleeve,—a\\nspectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself.\\n\\nThen, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations\\nabout Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,\\nthat I used to want—quite painfully—to burst into spiteful tears, fly\\nat Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister\\nspoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at\\nevery reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,\\nwould sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of\\nmy fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.\\n\\nIn these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,\\nwhile they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe’s perceiving that he\\nwas not favourable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old\\nenough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on\\nhis knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my\\nsister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into\\nopposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out\\nof his hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating\\nend to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to\\nlead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching\\nsight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, “Come!\\nthere’s enough of _you_! _You_ get along to bed; _you_’ve given trouble\\nenough for one night, I hope!” As if I had besought them as a favour to\\nbother my life out.\\n\\nWe went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we\\nshould continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss\\nHavisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my\\nshoulder; and said with some displeasure,—\\n\\n“You are growing tall, Pip!”\\n\\nI thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look,\\nthat this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no\\ncontrol.\\n\\nShe said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked at\\nme again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and\\nmoody. On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was\\nover, and I had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with a\\nmovement of her impatient fingers:—\\n\\n“Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.”\\n\\n“Joe Gargery, ma’am.”\\n\\n“Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?”\\n\\n“Yes, Miss Havisham.”\\n\\n“You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with\\nyou, and bring your indentures, do you think?”\\n\\nI signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honour to be\\nasked.\\n\\n“Then let him come.”\\n\\n“At any particular time, Miss Havisham?”\\n\\n“There, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and come\\nalong with you.”\\n\\nWhen I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister\\n“went on the Rampage,” in a more alarming degree than at any previous\\nperiod. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats\\nunder our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we\\ngraciously thought she _was_ fit for? When she had exhausted a torrent\\nof such inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud\\nsobbing, got out the dustpan,—which was always a very bad sign,—put on\\nher coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not\\nsatisfied with a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush,\\nand cleaned us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the\\nback-yard. It was ten o’clock at night before we ventured to creep in\\nagain, and then she asked Joe why he hadn’t married a Negress Slave at\\nonce? Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker\\nand looking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have\\nbeen a better speculation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIII.\\n\\n\\nIt was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joe\\narraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss\\nHavisham’s. However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to the\\noccasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in\\nhis working-dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself so\\ndreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for\\nme he pulled up his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the\\nhair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.\\n\\nAt breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town\\nwith us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook’s and called for “when we\\nhad done with our fine ladies”—a way of putting the case, from which\\nJoe appeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the\\nday, and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom to\\ndo on the very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllable\\nHOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the\\ndirection he had taken.\\n\\nWe walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver\\nbonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited\\nStraw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it was\\na fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles were\\ncarried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were\\ndisplayed as articles of property,—much as Cleopatra or any other\\nsovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or\\nprocession.\\n\\nWhen we came to Pumblechook’s, my sister bounced in and left us. As it\\nwas almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham’s house.\\nEstella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe\\ntook his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands;\\nas if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to\\nhalf a quarter of an ounce.\\n\\nEstella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew\\nso well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I looked back\\nat Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the\\ngreatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of\\nhis toes.\\n\\nEstella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff\\nand conducted him into Miss Havisham’s presence. She was seated at her\\ndressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.\\n\\n“Oh!” said she to Joe. “You are the husband of the sister of this boy?”\\n\\nI could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or\\nso like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, with\\nhis tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted a\\nworm.\\n\\n“You are the husband,” repeated Miss Havisham, “of the sister of this\\nboy?”\\n\\nIt was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted\\nin addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.\\n\\n“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe now observed in a manner that was at\\nonce expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great\\npoliteness, “as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time\\nwhat you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man.”\\n\\n“Well!” said Miss Havisham. “And you have reared the boy, with the\\nintention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?”\\n\\n“You know, Pip,” replied Joe, “as you and me were ever friends, and it\\nwere looked for’ard to betwixt us, as being calc’lated to lead to\\nlarks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the\\nbusiness,—such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,—not\\nbut what they would have been attended to, don’t you see?”\\n\\n“Has the boy,” said Miss Havisham, “ever made any objection? Does he\\nlike the trade?”\\n\\n“Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,” returned Joe,\\nstrengthening his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and\\npoliteness, “that it were the wish of your own hart.” (I saw the idea\\nsuddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the\\noccasion, before he went on to say) “And there weren’t no objection on\\nyour part, and Pip it were the great wish of your hart!”\\n\\nIt was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that he\\nought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures to\\nhim to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he\\npersisted in being to Me.\\n\\n“Have you brought his indentures with you?” asked Miss Havisham.\\n\\n“Well, Pip, you know,” replied Joe, as if that were a little\\nunreasonable, “you yourself see me put ’em in my ’at, and therefore you\\nknow as they are here.” With which he took them out, and gave them, not\\nto Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good\\nfellow,—I _know_ I was ashamed of him,—when I saw that Estella stood at\\nthe back of Miss Havisham’s chair, and that her eyes laughed\\nmischievously. I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to\\nMiss Havisham.\\n\\n“You expected,” said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, “no\\npremium with the boy?”\\n\\n“Joe!” I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all. “Why don’t you\\nanswer—”\\n\\n“Pip,” returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, “which I\\nmeantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself\\nand me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know it\\nto be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?”\\n\\nMiss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was\\nbetter than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and took\\nup a little bag from the table beside her.\\n\\n“Pip has earned a premium here,” she said, “and here it is. There are\\nfive-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip.”\\n\\nAs if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in\\nhim by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,\\npersisted in addressing me.\\n\\n“This is wery liberal on your part, Pip,” said Joe, “and it is as such\\nreceived and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near,\\nnor nowheres. And now, old chap,” said Joe, conveying to me a\\nsensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that\\nfamiliar expression were applied to Miss Havisham,—“and now, old chap,\\nmay we do our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and\\nanother, and by them which your liberal present—have-conweyed—to be—for\\nthe satisfaction of mind-of—them as never—” here Joe showed that he\\nfelt he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly\\nrescued himself with the words, “and from myself far be it!” These\\nwords had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them\\ntwice.\\n\\n“Good-bye, Pip!” said Miss Havisham. “Let them out, Estella.”\\n\\n“Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?” I asked.\\n\\n“No. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!”\\n\\nThus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe\\nin a distinct emphatic voice, “The boy has been a good boy here, and\\nthat is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no\\nother and no more.”\\n\\nHow Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I\\nknow that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs\\ninstead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went\\nafter him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the\\ngate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the\\ndaylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,\\n“Astonishing!” And there he remained so long saying, “Astonishing” at\\nintervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming\\nback. At length he prolonged his remark into “Pip, I do assure _you_\\nthis is as-TON-ishing!” and so, by degrees, became conversational and\\nable to walk away.\\n\\nI have reason to think that Joe’s intellects were brightened by the\\nencounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook’s\\nhe invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in what\\ntook place in Mr. Pumblechook’s parlour: where, on our presenting\\nourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.\\n\\n“Well?” cried my sister, addressing us both at once. “And what’s\\nhappened to _you_? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor\\nsociety as this, I am sure I do!”\\n\\n“Miss Havisham,” said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of\\nremembrance, “made it wery partick’ler that we should give her—were it\\ncompliments or respects, Pip?”\\n\\n“Compliments,” I said.\\n\\n“Which that were my own belief,” answered Joe; “her compliments to Mrs.\\nJ. Gargery—”\\n\\n“Much good they’ll do me!” observed my sister; but rather gratified\\ntoo.\\n\\n“And wishing,” pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another\\neffort of remembrance, “that the state of Miss Havisham’s elth were\\nsitch as would have—allowed, were it, Pip?”\\n\\n“Of her having the pleasure,” I added.\\n\\n“Of ladies’ company,” said Joe. And drew a long breath.\\n\\n“Well!” cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.\\n“She might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but\\nit’s better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipole\\nhere?”\\n\\n“She giv’ him,” said Joe, “nothing.”\\n\\nMrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.\\n\\n“What she giv’,” said Joe, “she giv’ to his friends. ‘And by his\\nfriends,’ were her explanation, ‘I mean into the hands of his sister\\nMrs. J. Gargery.’ Them were her words; ‘Mrs. J. Gargery.’ She mayn’t\\nhave know’d,” added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, “whether it\\nwere Joe, or Jorge.”\\n\\nMy sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden\\narm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all\\nabout it beforehand.\\n\\n“And how much have you got?” asked my sister, laughing. Positively\\nlaughing!\\n\\n“What would present company say to ten pound?” demanded Joe.\\n\\n“They’d say,” returned my sister, curtly, “pretty well. Not too much,\\nbut pretty well.”\\n\\n“It’s more than that, then,” said Joe.\\n\\nThat fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he\\nrubbed the arms of his chair, “It’s more than that, Mum.”\\n\\n“Why, you don’t mean to say—” began my sister.\\n\\n“Yes I do, Mum,” said Pumblechook; “but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good\\nin you! Go on!”\\n\\n“What would present company say,” proceeded Joe, “to twenty pound?”\\n\\n“Handsome would be the word,” returned my sister.\\n\\n“Well, then,” said Joe, “It’s more than twenty pound.”\\n\\nThat abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a\\npatronizing laugh, “It’s more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her\\nup, Joseph!”\\n\\n“Then to make an end of it,” said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to\\nmy sister; “it’s five-and-twenty pound.”\\n\\n“It’s five-and-twenty pound, Mum,” echoed that basest of swindlers,\\nPumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; “and it’s no more than\\nyour merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy\\nof the money!”\\n\\nIf the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently\\nawful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into\\ncustody, with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality\\nfar behind.\\n\\n“Now you see, Joseph and wife,” said Pumblechook, as he took me by the\\narm above the elbow, “I am one of them that always go right through\\nwith what they’ve begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. That’s\\n_my_ way. Bound out of hand.”\\n\\n“Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,” said my sister (grasping the\\nmoney), “we’re deeply beholden to you.”\\n\\n“Never mind me, Mum,” returned that diabolical cornchandler. “A\\npleasure’s a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know; we\\nmust have him bound. I said I’d see to it—to tell you the truth.”\\n\\nThe Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at once\\nwent over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial\\npresence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,\\nexactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick;\\nindeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken\\nred-handed; for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd,\\nI heard some people say, “What’s he done?” and others, “He’s a young\\n’un, too, but looks bad, don’t he?” One person of mild and benevolent\\naspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent\\nyoung man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and\\nentitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL.\\n\\nThe Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a\\nchurch,—and with people hanging over the pews looking on,—and with\\nmighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with\\nfolded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading\\nthe newspapers,—and with some shining black portraits on the walls,\\nwhich my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and\\nsticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and\\nattested, and I was “bound”; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while\\nas if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little\\npreliminaries disposed of.\\n\\nWhen we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been\\nput into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly\\ntortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were\\nmerely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook’s. And there my\\nsister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would\\nserve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue\\nBoar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring\\nthe Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle.\\n\\nIt was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For, it\\ninscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole\\ncompany, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it\\nworse, they all asked me from time to time,—in short, whenever they had\\nnothing else to do,—why I didn’t enjoy myself? And what could I\\npossibly do then, but say I _was_ enjoying myself,—when I wasn’t!\\n\\nHowever, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the\\nmost of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent\\ncontriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;\\nand, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had\\nfiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I\\nplayed at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,\\nor indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared\\nto contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair\\nbeside him to illustrate his remarks.\\n\\nMy only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they\\nwouldn’t let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off,\\nwoke me up and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the\\nevening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins’s ode, and threw his bloodstained\\nsword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and\\nsaid, “The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and it\\nwasn’t the Tumblers’ Arms.” That, they were all in excellent spirits on\\nthe road home, and sang, O Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and\\nasserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive\\nbore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by\\nwanting to know all about everybody’s private affairs) that _he_ was\\nthe man with his white locks flowing, and that he was upon the whole\\nthe weakest pilgrim going.\\n\\nFinally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly\\nwretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like\\nJoe’s trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIV.\\n\\n\\nIt is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be\\nblack ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive\\nand well deserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.\\n\\nHome had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister’s\\ntemper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I had\\nbelieved in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon; I had believed\\nin the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose\\nsolemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had\\nbelieved in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; I\\nhad believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and\\nindependence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all\\ncoarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella\\nsee it on any account.\\n\\nHow much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,\\nhow much Miss Havisham’s, how much my sister’s, is now of no moment to\\nme or to any one. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Well\\nor ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.\\n\\nOnce, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my\\nshirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe’s ’prentice, I should be\\ndistinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt\\nthat I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weight\\nupon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There have\\nbeen occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when I\\nhave felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its\\ninterest and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance\\nany more. Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my\\nway in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly\\nentered road of apprenticeship to Joe.\\n\\nI remember that at a later period of my “time,” I used to stand about\\nthe churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my\\nown perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness\\nbetween them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both\\nthere came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quite\\nas dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that\\nafter-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe\\nwhile my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I _am_ glad to\\nknow of myself in that connection.\\n\\nFor, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I\\nproceed to add was Joe’s. It was not because I was faithful, but\\nbecause Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier\\nor a sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of\\nindustry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,\\nthat I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible\\nto know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing\\nman flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it\\nhas touched one’s self in going by, and I know right well that any good\\nthat intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented\\nJoe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.\\n\\nWhat I wanted, who can say? How can _I_ say, when I never knew? What I\\ndreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and\\ncommonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one of\\nthe wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that she\\nwould, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing\\nthe coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.\\nOften after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were\\nsinging Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss\\nHavisham’s would seem to show me Estella’s face in the fire, with her\\npretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,—often at\\nsuch a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the\\nwall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her\\njust drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at\\nlast.\\n\\nAfter that, when we went in to supper, the place and the meal would\\nhave a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of\\nhome than ever, in my own ungracious breast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XV.\\n\\n\\nAs I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s room, my\\neducation under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however,\\nuntil Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the little\\ncatalogue of prices, to a comic song she had once bought for a\\nhalf-penny. Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of\\nliterature were the opening lines,\\n\\n     When I went to Lunnon town sirs,\\n     Too rul loo rul\\n     Too rul loo rul\\n     Wasn’t I done very brown sirs?\\n     Too rul loo rul\\n     Too rul loo rul\\n\\n\\n—still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with\\nthe utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit,\\nexcept that I thought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat in\\nexcess of the poetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to\\nMr. Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which he\\nkindly complied. As it turned out, however, that he only wanted me for\\na dramatic lay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over\\nand bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of\\nways, I soon declined that course of instruction; though not until Mr.\\nWopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me.\\n\\nWhatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe. This statement sounds so\\nwell, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. I wanted\\nto make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of my\\nsociety and less open to Estella’s reproach.\\n\\nThe old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken\\nslate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational\\nimplements: to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knew\\nJoe to remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire,\\nunder my tuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet he would smoke\\nhis pipe at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere\\nelse,—even with a learned air,—as if he considered himself to be\\nadvancing immensely. Dear fellow, I hope he did.\\n\\nIt was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river\\npassing beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low,\\nlooking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on\\nat the bottom of the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing out\\nto sea with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss\\nHavisham and Estella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off,\\nupon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just the\\nsame.—Miss Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange\\nlife appeared to have something to do with everything that was\\npicturesque.\\n\\nOne Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself\\non being “most awful dull,” that I had given him up for the day, I lay\\non the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying\\ntraces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky\\nand in the water, until at last I resolved to mention a thought\\nconcerning them that had been much in my head.\\n\\n“Joe,” said I; “don’t you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?”\\n\\n“Well, Pip,” returned Joe, slowly considering. “What for?”\\n\\n“What for, Joe? What is any visit made for?”\\n\\n“There is some wisits p’r’aps,” said Joe, “as for ever remains open to\\nthe question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might\\nthink you wanted something,—expected something of her.”\\n\\n“Don’t you think I might say that I did not, Joe?”\\n\\n“You might, old chap,” said Joe. “And she might credit it. Similarly\\nshe mightn’t.”\\n\\nJoe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard\\nat his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.\\n\\n“You see, Pip,” Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, “Miss\\nHavisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the\\nhandsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were\\nall.”\\n\\n“Yes, Joe. I heard her.”\\n\\n“ALL,” Joe repeated, very emphatically.\\n\\n“Yes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her.”\\n\\n“Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,—Make a end\\non it!—As you was!—Me to the North, and you to the South!—Keep in\\nsunders!”\\n\\nI had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to\\nfind that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more\\nprobable.\\n\\n“But, Joe.”\\n\\n“Yes, old chap.”\\n\\n“Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day\\nof my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after\\nher, or shown that I remember her.”\\n\\n“That’s true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes\\nall four round,—and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four\\nround might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of\\nhoofs—”\\n\\n“I don’t mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don’t mean a present.”\\n\\nBut Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon\\nit. “Or even,” said he, “if you was helped to knocking her up a new\\nchain for the front door,—or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws\\nfor general use,—or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork\\nwhen she took her muffins,—or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such\\nlike—”\\n\\n“I don’t mean any present at all, Joe,” I interposed.\\n\\n“Well,” said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly\\npressed it, “if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn’t. No, I would _not_. For\\nwhat’s a door-chain when she’s got one always up? And shark-headers is\\nopen to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you’d go\\ninto brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can’t\\nshow himself oncommon in a gridiron,—for a gridiron IS a gridiron,”\\nsaid Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring\\nto rouse me from a fixed delusion, “and you may haim at what you like,\\nbut a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your\\nleave, and you can’t help yourself—”\\n\\n“My dear Joe,” I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, “don’t\\ngo on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any\\npresent.”\\n\\n“No, Pip,” Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all\\nalong; “and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.”\\n\\n“Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack\\njust now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I\\nwould go uptown and make a call on Miss Est—Havisham.”\\n\\n“Which her name,” said Joe, gravely, “ain’t Estavisham, Pip, unless she\\nhave been rechris’ened.”\\n\\n“I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,\\nJoe?”\\n\\nIn brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of\\nit. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received\\nwith cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a\\nvisit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for\\na favour received, then this experimental trip should have no\\nsuccessor. By these conditions I promised to abide.\\n\\nNow, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick. He\\npretended that his Christian name was Dolge,—a clear Impossibility,—but\\nhe was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him to\\nhave been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but wilfully to\\nhave imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its\\nunderstanding. He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of\\ngreat strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even\\nseemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by\\nmere accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his\\ndinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the\\nWandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention\\nof ever coming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper’s out on the marshes,\\nand on working-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his\\nhands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his\\nneck and dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the\\nsluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,\\nlocomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or\\notherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,\\nhalf-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it\\nwas rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.\\n\\nThis morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and\\ntimid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner\\nof the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was\\nnecessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy,\\nand that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe’s ’prentice,\\nOrlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace\\nhim; howbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything,\\nor did anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he\\nalways beat his sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old\\nClem, he came in out of time.\\n\\nDolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of\\nmy half-holiday. He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had just\\ngot a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by\\nand by he said, leaning on his hammer,—\\n\\n“Now, master! Sure you’re not a-going to favour only one of us. If\\nYoung Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.” I suppose he\\nwas about five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an\\nancient person.\\n\\n“Why, what’ll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?” said Joe.\\n\\n“What’ll _I_ do with it! What’ll _he_ do with it? I’ll do as much with\\nit as _him_,” said Orlick.\\n\\n“As to Pip, he’s going up town,” said Joe.\\n\\n“Well then, as to Old Orlick, _he_’s a-going up town,” retorted that\\nworthy. “Two can go up town. Tain’t only one wot can go up town.\\n\\n“Don’t lose your temper,” said Joe.\\n\\n“Shall if I like,” growled Orlick. “Some and their uptowning! Now,\\nmaster! Come. No favouring in this shop. Be a man!”\\n\\nThe master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was\\nin a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot\\nbar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body,\\nwhisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,—as if\\nit were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,—and\\nfinally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and\\nhe again leaned on his hammer,—\\n\\n“Now, master!”\\n\\n“Are you all right now?” demanded Joe.\\n\\n“Ah! I am all right,” said gruff Old Orlick.\\n\\n“Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,” said\\nJoe, “let it be a half-holiday for all.”\\n\\nMy sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,—she was\\na most unscrupulous spy and listener,—and she instantly looked in at\\none of the windows.\\n\\n“Like you, you fool!” said she to Joe, “giving holidays to great idle\\nhulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in\\nthat way. I wish _I_ was his master!”\\n\\n“You’d be everybody’s master, if you durst,” retorted Orlick, with an\\nill-favoured grin.\\n\\n(“Let her alone,” said Joe.)\\n\\n“I’d be a match for all noodles and all rogues,” returned my sister,\\nbeginning to work herself into a mighty rage. “And I couldn’t be a\\nmatch for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who’s the\\ndunder-headed king of the noodles. And I couldn’t be a match for the\\nrogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and\\nthe worst rogue between this and France. Now!”\\n\\n“You’re a foul shrew, Mother Gargery,” growled the journeyman. “If that\\nmakes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good’un.”\\n\\n(“Let her alone, will you?” said Joe.)\\n\\n“What did you say?” cried my sister, beginning to scream. “What did you\\nsay? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he call me,\\nwith my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!” Each of these exclamations\\nwas a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of\\nall the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for\\nher, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she\\nconsciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself\\ninto it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; “what was the\\nname he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold\\nme! Oh!”\\n\\n“Ah-h-h!” growled the journeyman, between his teeth, “I’d hold you, if\\nyou was my wife. I’d hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.”\\n\\n(“I tell you, let her alone,” said Joe.)\\n\\n“Oh! To hear him!” cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a\\nscream together,—which was her next stage. “To hear the names he’s\\ngiving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With my\\nhusband standing by! Oh! Oh!” Here my sister, after a fit of clappings\\nand screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and\\nthrew her cap off, and pulled her hair down,—which were the last stages\\non her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete\\nsuccess, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.\\n\\nWhat could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical\\ninterruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he\\nmeant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether\\nhe was man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation\\nadmitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on his defence\\nstraightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt\\naprons, they went at one another, like two giants. But, if any man in\\nthat neighbourhood could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man.\\nOrlick, as if he had been of no more account than the pale young\\ngentleman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come\\nout of it. Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had\\ndropped insensible at the window (but who had seen the fight first, I\\nthink), and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who was\\nrecommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench her\\nhands in Joe’s hair. Then came that singular calm and silence which\\nsucceed all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation which I have\\nalways connected with such a lull,—namely, that it was Sunday, and\\nsomebody was dead,—I went upstairs to dress myself.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhen I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any\\nother traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick’s nostrils,\\nwhich was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared\\nfrom the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a\\npeaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence\\non Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting\\nobservation that might do me good, “On the Rampage, Pip, and off the\\nRampage, Pip:—such is Life!”\\n\\nWith what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are very\\nserious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going to\\nMiss Havisham’s, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed\\nthe gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how I\\ndebated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should\\nundoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.\\n\\nMiss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.\\n\\n“How, then? You here again?” said Miss Pocket. “What do you want?”\\n\\nWhen I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah\\nevidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my\\nbusiness. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in,\\nand presently brought the sharp message that I was to “come up.”\\n\\nEverything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.\\n\\n“Well?” said she, fixing her eyes upon me. “I hope you want nothing?\\nYou’ll get nothing.”\\n\\n“No indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing\\nvery well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.”\\n\\n“There, there!” with the old restless fingers. “Come now and then; come\\non your birthday.—Ay!” she cried suddenly, turning herself and her\\nchair towards me, “You are looking round for Estella? Hey?”\\n\\nI had been looking round,—in fact, for Estella,—and I stammered that I\\nhoped she was well.\\n\\n“Abroad,” said Miss Havisham; “educating for a lady; far out of reach;\\nprettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that you\\nhave lost her?”\\n\\nThere was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last\\nwords, and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a\\nloss what to say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by\\ndismissing me. When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the\\nwalnut-shell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my\\nhome and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by\\n_that_ motion.\\n\\nAs I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at\\nthe shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,\\nwho should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had in\\nhis hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that\\nmoment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on\\nthe head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner\\ndid he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence\\nhad put a ’prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,\\nand insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlour. As I\\nknew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the\\nway was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better\\nthan none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into\\nPumblechook’s just as the street and the shops were lighting up.\\n\\nAs I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I\\ndon’t know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it\\ntook until half-past nine o’ clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle\\ngot into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he\\nbecame so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful\\ncareer. I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being\\ncut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been running to\\nseed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was\\na mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the\\nidentification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When\\nBarnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively\\napologetic, Pumblechook’s indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle,\\ntoo, took pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and\\nmaudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating\\ncircumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on every\\noccasion; it became sheer monomania in my master’s daughter to care a\\nbutton for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating\\nconduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general\\nfeebleness of my character. Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle\\nhad closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his\\nhead, and saying, “Take warning, boy, take warning!” as if it were a\\nwell-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided\\nI could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.\\n\\nIt was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with\\nMr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out,\\nand it fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of\\nthe lamp’s usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance\\non the fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose\\nwith a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we\\ncame upon a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.\\n\\n“Halloa!” we said, stopping. “Orlick there?”\\n\\n“Ah!” he answered, slouching out. “I was standing by a minute, on the\\nchance of company.”\\n\\n“You are late,” I remarked.\\n\\nOrlick not unnaturally answered, “Well? And _you_’re late.”\\n\\n“We have been,” said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,—“we\\nhave been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.”\\n\\nOld Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all\\nwent on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spending\\nhis half-holiday up and down town?\\n\\n“Yes,” said he, “all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn’t see\\nyou, but I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns\\nis going again.”\\n\\n“At the Hulks?” said I.\\n\\n“Ay! There’s some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been\\ngoing since dark, about. You’ll hear one presently.”\\n\\nIn effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the\\nwell-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily\\nrolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing\\nand threatening the fugitives.\\n\\n“A good night for cutting off in,” said Orlick. “We’d be puzzled how to\\nbring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.”\\n\\nThe subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in\\nsilence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening’s\\ntragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick,\\nwith his hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very\\ndark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the\\nsound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled\\nsulkily along the course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my\\nthoughts. Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game\\non Bosworth Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick\\nsometimes growled, “Beat it out, beat it out,—Old Clem! With a clink\\nfor the stout,—Old Clem!” I thought he had been drinking, but he was\\nnot drunk.\\n\\nThus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us\\npast the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find—it being\\neleven o’clock—in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and\\nunwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered\\nabout. Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter (surmising that\\na convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.\\n\\n“There’s something wrong,” said he, without stopping, “up at your\\nplace, Pip. Run all!”\\n\\n“What is it?” I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my side.\\n\\n“I can’t quite understand. The house seems to have been violently\\nentered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has\\nbeen attacked and hurt.”\\n\\nWe were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no\\nstop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole\\nvillage was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there\\nwas Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst\\nof the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,\\nand so I became aware of my sister,—lying without sense or movement on\\nthe bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on\\nthe back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was\\nturned towards the fire,—destined never to be on the Rampage again,\\nwhile she was the wife of Joe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVI.\\n\\n\\nWith my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to\\nbelieve that _I_ must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister,\\nor at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under\\nobligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than\\nany one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began\\nto reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all\\nsides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.\\n\\nJoe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a\\nquarter after eight o’clock to a quarter before ten. While he was\\nthere, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had\\nexchanged Good Night with a farm-labourer going home. The man could not\\nbe more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into\\ndense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been\\nbefore nine. When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found\\nher struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The\\nfire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle\\nvery long; the candle, however, had been blown out.\\n\\nNothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond\\nthe blowing out of the candle,—which stood on a table between the door\\nand my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and\\nwas struck,—was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such\\nas she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one\\nremarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with\\nsomething blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were\\ndealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable\\nviolence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when\\nJoe picked her up, was a convict’s leg-iron which had been filed\\nasunder.\\n\\nNow, Joe, examining this iron with a smith’s eye, declared it to have\\nbeen filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the\\nHulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe’s opinion was\\ncorroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the\\nprison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they\\nclaimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been\\nworn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further,\\none of those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his\\niron.\\n\\nKnowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed\\nthe iron to be my convict’s iron,—the iron I had seen and heard him\\nfiling at, on the marshes,—but my mind did not accuse him of having put\\nit to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have\\nbecome possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.\\nEither Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.\\n\\nNow, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we\\npicked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the\\nevening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and\\nhe had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against\\nhim, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with\\neverybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if\\nhe had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no\\ndispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore\\nthem. Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in\\nso silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could\\nlook round.\\n\\nIt was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however\\nundesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered\\nunspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I\\nshould at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the\\nstory. For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally\\nin the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The\\ncontention came, after all, to this;—the secret was such an old one\\nnow, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not\\ntear it away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much\\nmischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me\\nif he believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not\\nbelieve it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets\\nas a monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of\\ncourse—for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing\\nis always done?—and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see\\nany such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of\\nthe assailant.\\n\\nThe Constables and the Bow Street men from London—for, this happened in\\nthe days of the extinct red-waistcoated police—were about the house for\\na week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like\\nauthorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously\\nwrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,\\nand persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead\\nof trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood\\nabout the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks\\nthat filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration; and they had a\\nmysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as\\ntaking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.\\n\\nLong after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay\\nvery ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects\\nmultiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of\\nthe realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and\\nher speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as\\nto be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always\\nby her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate\\nin speech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than\\nindifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader,\\nextraordinary complications arose between them which I was always\\ncalled in to solve. The administration of mutton instead of medicine,\\nthe substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among\\nthe mildest of my own mistakes.\\n\\nHowever, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A\\ntremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part\\nof her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three\\nmonths, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then\\nremain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We\\nwere at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a\\ncircumstance happened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle’s\\ngreat-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had\\nfallen, and Biddy became a part of our establishment.\\n\\nIt may have been about a month after my sister’s reappearance in the\\nkitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the\\nwhole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.\\nAbove all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly\\ncut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had\\nbeen accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me\\nevery now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, “Such a fine\\nfigure of a woman as she once were, Pip!” Biddy instantly taking the\\ncleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe\\nbecame able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,\\nand to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that\\ndid him good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had\\nall more or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and that\\nthey had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest\\nspirits they had ever encountered.\\n\\nBiddy’s first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty that\\nhad completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made\\nnothing of it. Thus it was:—\\n\\nAgain and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a\\ncharacter that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost\\neagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly\\nwanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,\\nfrom tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the\\nsign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my\\nsister’s ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a\\nqualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one\\nafter another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the\\nshape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and\\ndisplayed it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook\\nher head to that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified\\nlest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.\\n\\nWhen my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this\\nmysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully at\\nit, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked\\nthoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his\\ninitial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.\\n\\n“Why, of course!” cried Biddy, with an exultant face. “Don’t you see?\\nIt’s _him_!”\\n\\nOrlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signify\\nhim by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into the\\nkitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his\\narm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching out,\\nwith a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly\\ndistinguished him.\\n\\nI confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I was\\ndisappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest\\nanxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his\\nbeing at length produced, and motioned that she would have him given\\nsomething to drink. She watched his countenance as if she were\\nparticularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his\\nreception, she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and\\nthere was an air of humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have\\nseen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master. After that\\nday, a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate,\\nand without Orlick’s slouching in and standing doggedly before her, as\\nif he knew no more than I did what to make of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVII.\\n\\n\\nI now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was\\nvaried beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more\\nremarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying\\nanother visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty\\nat the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and she\\nspoke of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words.\\nThe interview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when I\\nwas going, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mention\\nat once that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline taking\\nthe guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than\\ncausing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after\\nthat, I took it.\\n\\nSo unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened\\nroom, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that\\nI felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that\\nmysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew\\nolder, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my\\nthoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact.\\nIt bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate\\nmy trade and to be ashamed of home.\\n\\nImperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Her\\nshoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands\\nwere always clean. She was not beautiful,—she was common, and could not\\nbe like Estella,—but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.\\nShe had not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newly\\nout of mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myself\\none evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes\\nthat were very pretty and very good.\\n\\nIt came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring\\nat—writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at\\nonce by a sort of stratagem—and seeing Biddy observant of what I was\\nabout. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without\\nlaying it down.\\n\\n“Biddy,” said I, “how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you\\nare very clever.”\\n\\n“What is it that I manage? I don’t know,” returned Biddy, smiling.\\n\\nShe managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not\\nmean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.\\n\\n“How do you manage, Biddy,” said I, “to learn everything that I learn,\\nand always to keep up with me?” I was beginning to be rather vain of my\\nknowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the\\ngreater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have\\nno doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.\\n\\n“I might as well ask you,” said Biddy, “how _you_ manage?”\\n\\n“No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see\\nme turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.”\\n\\n“I suppose I must catch it like a cough,” said Biddy, quietly; and went\\non with her sewing.\\n\\nPursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at\\nBiddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her\\nrather an extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was\\nequally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our\\ndifferent sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I\\nknew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith\\nas I, or better.\\n\\n“You are one of those, Biddy,” said I, “who make the most of every\\nchance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how\\nimproved you are!”\\n\\nBiddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. “I was\\nyour first teacher though; wasn’t I?” said she, as she sewed.\\n\\n“Biddy!” I exclaimed, in amazement. “Why, you are crying!”\\n\\n“No I am not,” said Biddy, looking up and laughing. “What put that in\\nyour head?”\\n\\nWhat could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it\\ndropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been\\nuntil Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of\\nliving, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled\\nthe hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the\\nmiserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,\\nwith that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and\\nshouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must\\nhave been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first\\nuneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of\\ncourse. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I\\nlooked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps\\nI had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too\\nreserved, and should have patronised her more (though I did not use\\nthat precise word in my meditations) with my confidence.\\n\\n“Yes, Biddy,” I observed, when I had done turning it over, “you were my\\nfirst teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being\\ntogether like this, in this kitchen.”\\n\\n“Ah, poor thing!” replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness to\\ntransfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,\\nmaking her more comfortable; “that’s sadly true!”\\n\\n“Well!” said I, “we must talk together a little more, as we used to do.\\nAnd I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a\\nquiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.”\\n\\nMy sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook\\nthe care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out\\ntogether. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed\\nthe village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the\\nmarshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I\\nbegan to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my\\nusual way. When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank,\\nwith the water rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it\\nwould have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time\\nand place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.\\n\\n“Biddy,” said I, after binding her to secrecy, “I want to be a\\ngentleman.”\\n\\n“O, I wouldn’t, if I was you!” she returned. “I don’t think it would\\nanswer.”\\n\\n“Biddy,” said I, with some severity, “I have particular reasons for\\nwanting to be a gentleman.”\\n\\n“You know best, Pip; but don’t you think you are happier as you are?”\\n\\n“Biddy,” I exclaimed, impatiently, “I am not at all happy as I am. I am\\ndisgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to\\neither, since I was bound. Don’t be absurd.”\\n\\n“Was I absurd?” said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; “I am sorry\\nfor that; I didn’t mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be\\ncomfortable.”\\n\\n“Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be\\ncomfortable—or anything but miserable—there, Biddy!—unless I can lead a\\nvery different sort of life from the life I lead now.”\\n\\n“That’s a pity!” said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.\\n\\nNow, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind\\nof quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half\\ninclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave\\nutterance to her sentiment and my own. I told her she was right, and I\\nknew it was much to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.\\n\\n“If I could have settled down,” I said to Biddy, plucking up the short\\ngrass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings\\nout of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,—“if I could have\\nsettled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was\\nlittle, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joe\\nwould have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone\\npartners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to\\nkeep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a\\nfine Sunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for\\n_you_; shouldn’t I, Biddy?”\\n\\nBiddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for\\nanswer, “Yes; I am not over-particular.” It scarcely sounded\\nflattering, but I knew she meant well.\\n\\n“Instead of that,” said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade\\nor two, “see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable,\\nand—what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had\\ntold me so!”\\n\\nBiddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more\\nattentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.\\n\\n“It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,” she\\nremarked, directing her eyes to the ships again. “Who said it?”\\n\\nI was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where I\\nwas going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I\\nanswered, “The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’s, and she’s more\\nbeautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I\\nwant to be a gentleman on her account.” Having made this lunatic\\nconfession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I\\nhad some thoughts of following it.\\n\\n“Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?”\\nBiddy quietly asked me, after a pause.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” I moodily answered.\\n\\n“Because, if it is to spite her,” Biddy pursued, “I should think—but\\nyou know best—that might be better and more independently done by\\ncaring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should\\nthink—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.”\\n\\nExactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was\\nperfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed\\nvillage lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and\\nwisest of men fall every day?\\n\\n“It may be all quite true,” said I to Biddy, “but I admire her\\ndreadfully.”\\n\\nIn short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good\\ngrasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All\\nthe while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and\\nmisplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my face\\nright, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the\\npebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.\\n\\nBiddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.\\nShe put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by\\nwork, upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my\\nhair. Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with\\nmy face upon my sleeve I cried a little,—exactly as I had done in the\\nbrewery yard,—and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used\\nby somebody, or by everybody; I can’t say which.\\n\\n“I am glad of one thing,” said Biddy, “and that is, that you have felt\\nyou could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing,\\nand that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it\\nand always so far deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such a\\npoor one, and so much in need of being taught herself!) had been your\\nteacher at the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she would\\nset. But it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her,\\nand it’s of no use now.” So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from\\nthe bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, “Shall\\nwe walk a little farther, or go home?”\\n\\n“Biddy,” I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving\\nher a kiss, “I shall always tell you everything.”\\n\\n“Till you’re a gentleman,” said Biddy.\\n\\n“You know I never shall be, so that’s always. Not that I have any\\noccasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,—as I\\ntold you at home the other night.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.\\nAnd then repeated, with her former pleasant change, “shall we walk a\\nlittle farther, or go home?”\\n\\nI said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the\\nsummer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very\\nbeautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and\\nwholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing\\nbeggar my neighbour by candle-light in the room with the stopped\\nclocks, and being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good\\nfor me if I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those\\nremembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish\\nwhat I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked\\nmyself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were\\nbeside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable?\\nI was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said\\nto myself, “Pip, what a fool you are!”\\n\\nWe talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed\\nright. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and\\nsomebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no\\npleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her\\nown breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her\\nmuch the better of the two?\\n\\n“Biddy,” said I, when we were walking homeward, “I wish you could put\\nme right.”\\n\\n“I wish I could!” said Biddy.\\n\\n“If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,—you don’t mind my\\nspeaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?”\\n\\n“Oh dear, not at all!” said Biddy. “Don’t mind me.”\\n\\n“If I could only get myself to do it, _that_ would be the thing for\\nme.”\\n\\n“But you never will, you see,” said Biddy.\\n\\nIt did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would\\nhave done if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore\\nobserved I was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she _was_, and\\nshe said it decisively. In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet\\nI took it rather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.\\n\\nWhen we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and\\nget over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate,\\nor from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant\\nway), Old Orlick.\\n\\n“Halloa!” he growled, “where are you two going?”\\n\\n“Where should we be going, but home?”\\n\\n“Well, then,” said he, “I’m jiggered if I don’t see you home!”\\n\\nThis penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case of\\nhis. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of,\\nbut used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind,\\nand convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger,\\nI had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he\\nwould have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.\\n\\nBiddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,\\n“Don’t let him come; I don’t like him.” As I did not like him either, I\\ntook the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn’t want\\nseeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of\\nlaughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little\\ndistance.\\n\\nCurious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in\\nthat murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give\\nany account, I asked her why she did not like him.\\n\\n“Oh!” she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,\\n“because I—I am afraid he likes me.”\\n\\n“Did he ever tell you he liked you?” I asked indignantly.\\n\\n“No,” said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, “he never told me\\nso; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.”\\n\\nHowever novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not\\ndoubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon\\nOld Orlick’s daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on\\nmyself.\\n\\n“But it makes no difference to you, you know,” said Biddy, calmly.\\n\\n“No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don’t like it; I don’t\\napprove of it.”\\n\\n“Nor I neither,” said Biddy. “Though _that_ makes no difference to\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Exactly,” said I; “but I must tell you I should have no opinion of\\nyou, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.”\\n\\nI kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances\\nwere favourable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that\\ndemonstration. He had struck root in Joe’s establishment, by reason of\\nmy sister’s sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him\\ndismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as\\nI had reason to know thereafter.\\n\\nAnd now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated\\nits confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I\\nwas clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the\\nplain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be\\nashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and\\nhappiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my\\ndisaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was\\ngrowing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company\\nwith Biddy,—when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the\\nHavisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and\\nscatter my wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and\\noften before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in\\nall directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss\\nHavisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out.\\n\\nIf my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my\\nperplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was\\nbrought to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVIII.\\n\\n\\nIt was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a\\nSaturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three\\nJolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.\\nOf that group I was one.\\n\\nA highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued\\nin blood to the eyebrows. He gloated over every abhorrent adjective in\\nthe description, and identified himself with every witness at the\\nInquest. He faintly moaned, “I am done for,” as the victim, and he\\nbarbarously bellowed, “I’ll serve you out,” as the murderer. He gave\\nthe medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner;\\nand he piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard\\nblows, to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding\\nthe mental competency of that witness. The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle’s\\nhands, became Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus. He enjoyed\\nhimself thoroughly, and we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully\\ncomfortable. In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful\\nMurder.\\n\\nThen, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning\\nover the back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was an\\nexpression of contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a great\\nforefinger as he watched the group of faces.\\n\\n“Well!” said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done,\\n“you have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?”\\n\\nEverybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He looked\\nat everybody coldly and sarcastically.\\n\\n“Guilty, of course?” said he. “Out with it. Come!”\\n\\n“Sir,” returned Mr. Wopsle, “without having the honour of your\\nacquaintance, I do say Guilty.” Upon this we all took courage to unite\\nin a confirmatory murmur.\\n\\n“I know you do,” said the stranger; “I knew you would. I told you so.\\nBut now I’ll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know, that\\nthe law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is\\nproved—proved—to be guilty?”\\n\\n“Sir,” Mr. Wopsle began to reply, “as an Englishman myself, I—”\\n\\n“Come!” said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. “Don’t evade\\nthe question. Either you know it, or you don’t know it. Which is it to\\nbe?”\\n\\nHe stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a\\nbullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.\\nWopsle,—as it were to mark him out—before biting it again.\\n\\n“Now!” said he. “Do you know it, or don’t you know it?”\\n\\n“Certainly I know it,” replied Mr. Wopsle.\\n\\n“Certainly you know it. Then why didn’t you say so at first? Now, I’ll\\nask you another question,”—taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he\\nhad a right to him,—“_do_ you know that none of these witnesses have\\nyet been cross-examined?”\\n\\nMr. Wopsle was beginning, “I can only say—” when the stranger stopped\\nhim.\\n\\n“What? You won’t answer the question, yes or no? Now, I’ll try you\\nagain.” Throwing his finger at him again. “Attend to me. Are you aware,\\nor are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been\\ncross-examined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?”\\n\\nMr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor\\nopinion of him.\\n\\n“Come!” said the stranger, “I’ll help you. You don’t deserve help, but\\nI’ll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?”\\n\\n“What is it?” repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.\\n\\n“Is it,” pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious\\nmanner, “the printed paper you have just been reading from?”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly.”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it\\ndistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal\\nadvisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?”\\n\\n“I read that just now,” Mr. Wopsle pleaded.\\n\\n“Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don’t ask you what you read\\njust now. You may read the Lord’s Prayer backwards, if you like,—and,\\nperhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my\\nfriend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to the\\nbottom, to the bottom.” (We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of\\nsubterfuge.) “Well? Have you found it?”\\n\\n“Here it is,” said Mr. Wopsle.\\n\\n“Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it\\ndistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was\\ninstructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come!\\nDo you make that of it?”\\n\\nMr. Wopsle answered, “Those are not the exact words.”\\n\\n“Not the exact words!” repeated the gentleman bitterly. “Is that the\\nexact substance?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Mr. Wopsle.\\n\\n“Yes,” repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company\\nwith his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. “And now I\\nask you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that\\npassage before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having\\npronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?”\\n\\nWe all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought\\nhim, and that he was beginning to be found out.\\n\\n“And that same man, remember,” pursued the gentleman, throwing his\\nfinger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,—“that same man might be summoned as a\\njuryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed\\nhimself, might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon\\nhis pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly\\ntry the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the\\nprisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to the\\nevidence, so help him God!”\\n\\nWe were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too\\nfar, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet\\ntime.\\n\\nThe strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and\\nwith a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of\\nus that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to\\ndisclose it, left the back of the settle, and came into the space\\nbetween the two settles, in front of the fire, where he remained\\nstanding, his left hand in his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of\\nhis right.\\n\\n“From information I have received,” said he, looking round at us as we\\nall quailed before him, “I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith\\namong you, by name Joseph—or Joe—Gargery. Which is the man?”\\n\\n“Here is the man,” said Joe.\\n\\nThe strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went.\\n\\n“You have an apprentice,” pursued the stranger, “commonly known as Pip?\\nIs he here?”\\n\\n“I am here!” I cried.\\n\\nThe stranger did not recognise me, but I recognised him as the\\ngentleman I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit\\nto Miss Havisham. I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the\\nsettle, and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my\\nshoulder, I checked off again in detail his large head, his dark\\ncomplexion, his deep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large\\nwatch-chain, his strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the\\nsmell of scented soap on his great hand.\\n\\n“I wish to have a private conference with you two,” said he, when he\\nhad surveyed me at his leisure. “It will take a little time. Perhaps we\\nhad better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my\\ncommunication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you\\nplease to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.”\\n\\nAmidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen,\\nand in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strange\\ngentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of\\nhis finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion\\nas an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front\\ndoor. Our conference was held in the state parlour, which was feebly\\nlighted by one candle.\\n\\nIt began with the strange gentleman’s sitting down at the table,\\ndrawing the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his\\npocket-book. He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little\\naside, after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to\\nascertain which was which.\\n\\n“My name,” he said, “is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am\\npretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I\\ncommence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice\\nhad been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you\\nsee me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I\\ndo. No less, no more.”\\n\\nFinding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got\\nup, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus\\nhaving one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.\\n\\n“Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of\\nthis young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his\\nindentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for\\nso doing?”\\n\\n“Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip’s\\nway,” said Joe, staring.\\n\\n“Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,” returned Mr.\\nJaggers. “The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want\\nanything?”\\n\\n“The answer is,” returned Joe, sternly, “No.”\\n\\nI thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool\\nfor his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between\\nbreathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.\\n\\n“Very well,” said Mr. Jaggers. “Recollect the admission you have made,\\nand don’t try to go from it presently.”\\n\\n“Who’s a-going to try?” retorted Joe.\\n\\n“I don’t say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?”\\n\\n“Yes, I do keep a dog.”\\n\\n“Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.\\nBear that in mind, will you?” repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes\\nand nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.\\n“Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got\\nto make is, that he has great expectations.”\\n\\nJoe and I gasped, and looked at one another.\\n\\n“I am instructed to communicate to him,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\\nfinger at me sideways, “that he will come into a handsome property.\\nFurther, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that\\nproperty, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of\\nlife and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,—in a word,\\nas a young fellow of great expectations.”\\n\\nMy dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss\\nHavisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.\\n\\n“Now, Mr. Pip,” pursued the lawyer, “I address the rest of what I have\\nto say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request of\\nthe person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the\\nname of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great\\nexpectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have\\nany objection, this is the time to mention it.”\\n\\nMy heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,\\nthat I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.\\n\\n“I should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that\\nthe name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a\\nprofound secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered\\nto mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first\\nhand by word of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be\\ncarried out, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now,\\nyou are distinctly to understand that you are most positively\\nprohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or\\nreference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as _the_\\nindividual, in all the communications you may have with me. If you have\\na suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast.\\nIt is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition\\nare; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere\\nwhim. This is not for you to inquire into. The condition is laid down.\\nYour acceptance of it, and your observance of it as binding, is the\\nonly remaining condition that I am charged with, by the person from\\nwhom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not otherwise\\nresponsible. That person is the person from whom you derive your\\nexpectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me.\\nAgain, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a\\nrise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it, this is the time\\nto mention it. Speak out.”\\n\\nOnce more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.\\n\\n“I should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations.”\\nThough he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he\\nstill could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and\\neven now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while\\nhe spoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my\\ndisparagement, if he only chose to mention them. “We come next, to mere\\ndetails of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used the\\nterm ‘expectations’ more than once, you are not endowed with\\nexpectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money\\namply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will\\nplease consider me your guardian. Oh!” for I was going to thank him, “I\\ntell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn’t render\\nthem. It is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance\\nwith your altered position, and that you will be alive to the\\nimportance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage.”\\n\\nI said I had always longed for it.\\n\\n“Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,” he retorted;\\n“keep to the record. If you long for it now, that’s enough. Am I\\nanswered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper\\ntutor? Is that it?”\\n\\nI stammered yes, that was it.\\n\\n“Good. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don’t think that\\nwise, mind, but it’s my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whom\\nyou would prefer to another?”\\n\\nI had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt;\\nso, I replied in the negative.\\n\\n“There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think\\nmight suit the purpose,” said Mr. Jaggers. “I don’t recommend him,\\nobserve; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is\\none Mr. Matthew Pocket.”\\n\\nAh! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham’s relation. The\\nMatthew whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew whose\\nplace was to be at Miss Havisham’s head, when she lay dead, in her\\nbride’s dress on the bride’s table.\\n\\n“You know the name?” said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then\\nshutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.\\n\\nMy answer was, that I had heard of the name.\\n\\n“Oh!” said he. “You have heard of the name. But the question is, what\\ndo you say of it?”\\n\\nI said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for his\\nrecommendation—\\n\\n“No, my young friend!” he interrupted, shaking his great head very\\nslowly. “Recollect yourself!”\\n\\nNot recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him\\nfor his recommendation—\\n\\n“No, my young friend,” he interrupted, shaking his head and frowning\\nand smiling both at once,—“no, no, no; it’s very well done, but it\\nwon’t do; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not\\nthe word, Mr. Pip. Try another.”\\n\\nCorrecting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his\\nmention of Mr. Matthew Pocket—\\n\\n“_That_’s more like it!” cried Mr. Jaggers.—And (I added), I would\\ngladly try that gentleman.\\n\\n“Good. You had better try him in his own house. The way shall be\\nprepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London. When\\nwill you come to London?”\\n\\nI said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that I\\nsupposed I could come directly.\\n\\n“First,” said Mr. Jaggers, “you should have some new clothes to come\\nin, and they should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You’ll\\nwant some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?”\\n\\nHe produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them\\nout on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time he\\nhad taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the chair when he\\nhad pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.\\n\\n“Well, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?”\\n\\n“I _am_!” said Joe, in a very decided manner.\\n\\n“It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?”\\n\\n“It were understood,” said Joe. “And it are understood. And it ever\\nwill be similar according.”\\n\\n“But what,” said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,—“what if it was in my\\ninstructions to make you a present, as compensation?”\\n\\n“As compensation what for?” Joe demanded.\\n\\n“For the loss of his services.”\\n\\nJoe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I have\\noften thought him since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or\\npat an egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. “Pip\\nis that hearty welcome,” said Joe, “to go free with his services, to\\nhonour and fortun’, as no words can tell him. But if you think as Money\\ncan make compensation to me for the loss of the little child—what come\\nto the forge—and ever the best of friends!—”\\n\\nO dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I\\nsee you again, with your muscular blacksmith’s arm before your eyes,\\nand your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good\\nfaithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my\\narm, as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel’s\\nwing!\\n\\nBut I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future\\nfortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. I\\nbegged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the best\\nof friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Joe scooped his eyes\\nwith his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but\\nsaid not another word.\\n\\nMr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognised in Joe the\\nvillage idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said,\\nweighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:—\\n\\n“Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half\\nmeasures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in\\ncharge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the\\ncontrary you mean to say—” Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped\\nby Joe’s suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell\\npugilistic purpose.\\n\\n“Which I meantersay,” cried Joe, “that if you come into my place\\nbull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if\\nyou’re a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay\\nand stand or fall by!”\\n\\nI drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to\\nme, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any\\none whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a-going to be\\nbull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when\\nJoe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing any\\ninclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory\\nremarks. They were these.\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here—as you are to be a\\ngentleman—the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall\\nreceive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a\\nhackney-coach at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to\\nme. Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the\\ntrust I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now,\\nunderstand that, finally. Understand that!”\\n\\nHe was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone\\non, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.\\n\\nSomething came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he\\nwas going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired\\ncarriage.\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.”\\n\\n“Halloa!” said he, facing round, “what’s the matter?”\\n\\n“I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;\\nso I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my\\ntaking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?”\\n\\n“No,” said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.\\n\\n“I don’t mean in the village only, but up town?”\\n\\n“No,” said he. “No objection.”\\n\\nI thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had\\nalready locked the front door and vacated the state parlour, and was\\nseated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at\\nthe burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the\\ncoals, and nothing was said for a long time.\\n\\nMy sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at\\nher needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next\\nJoe in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the\\nglowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the\\nlonger the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.\\n\\nAt length I got out, “Joe, have you told Biddy?”\\n\\n“No, Pip,” returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his\\nknees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to\\nmake off somewhere, “which I left it to yourself, Pip.”\\n\\n“I would rather you told, Joe.”\\n\\n“Pip’s a gentleman of fortun’ then,” said Joe, “and God bless him in\\nit!”\\n\\nBiddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked\\nat me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily\\ncongratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their\\ncongratulations that I rather resented.\\n\\nI took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with\\nthe grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and\\nsay nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in\\ngood time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said,\\nsave that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.\\nBiddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work\\nagain, and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining\\nhis knees, said, “Ay, ay, I’ll be ekervally partickler, Pip;” and then\\nthey congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at\\nthe notion of my being a gentleman that I didn’t half like it.\\n\\nInfinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some\\nidea of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts\\nentirely failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times,\\nand even repeated after Biddy, the words “Pip” and “Property.” But I\\ndoubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I\\ncannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind.\\n\\nI never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddy\\nbecame more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.\\nDissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is\\npossible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied\\nwith myself.\\n\\nAnyhow, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,\\nlooking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and\\nabout what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I\\ncaught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they\\noften looked at me,—particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they\\nwere expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did\\nby word or sign.\\n\\nAt those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen\\ndoor opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings\\nto air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am\\nafraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the\\nrustic objects among which I had passed my life.\\n\\n“Saturday night,” said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese\\nand beer. “Five more days, and then the day before _the_ day! They’ll\\nsoon go.”\\n\\n“Yes, Pip,” observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.\\n“They’ll soon go.”\\n\\n“Soon, soon go,” said Biddy.\\n\\n“I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and\\norder my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I’ll come and put\\nthem on there, or that I’ll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook’s. It\\nwould be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.”\\n\\n“Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure\\ntoo, Pip,” said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese\\non it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper\\nas if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. “So might\\nWopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.”\\n\\n“That’s just what I don’t want, Joe. They would make such a business of\\nit,—such a coarse and common business,—that I couldn’t bear myself.”\\n\\n“Ah, that indeed, Pip!” said Joe. “If you couldn’t abear yourself—”\\n\\nBiddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister’s plate, “Have you\\nthought about when you’ll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister\\nand me? You will show yourself to us; won’t you?”\\n\\n“Biddy,” I returned with some resentment, “you are so exceedingly quick\\nthat it’s difficult to keep up with you.”\\n\\n(“She always were quick,” observed Joe.)\\n\\n“If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say\\nthat I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,—most likely\\non the evening before I go away.”\\n\\nBiddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an\\naffectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I\\ngot into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a\\nmean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above,\\nfor ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even\\nat the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind\\nbetween it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in\\nso often between the forge and Miss Havisham’s, and Biddy and Estella.\\n\\nThe sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and\\nthe room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I\\nsaw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or\\ntwo in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and\\nlight it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me\\nthat he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.\\n\\nHe presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his\\npipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew\\nthat they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing\\ntone by both of them more than once. I would not have listened for\\nmore, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and\\nsat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and\\nstrange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the\\nloneliest I had ever known.\\n\\nLooking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe’s pipe\\nfloating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,—not\\nobtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared\\ntogether. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy\\nbed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIX.\\n\\n\\nMorning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,\\nand brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay\\nheaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened\\nbetween me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of a\\nmisgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and\\nthat, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or\\nclean gone.\\n\\nJoe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our\\napproaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After\\nbreakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best\\nparlour, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With\\nall the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe,\\nand thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn’t have read that about the\\nrich man and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.\\n\\nAfter our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off\\nthe marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I\\nfelt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion\\nfor the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after\\nSunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the\\nlow green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them\\none of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner\\nof roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of\\ncondescension, upon everybody in the village.\\n\\nIf I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my\\ncompanionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among\\nthose graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place\\nrecalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and\\nbadge! My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he\\nhad doubtless been transported a long way off, and that he was dead to\\nme, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.\\n\\nNo more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these\\ngrazing cattle,—though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a\\nmore respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might\\nstare as long as possible at the possessor of such great\\nexpectations,—farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,\\nhenceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith’s work in\\ngeneral, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,\\nlying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham\\nintended me for Estella, fell asleep.\\n\\nWhen I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,\\nsmoking his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my\\neyes, and said,—\\n\\n“As being the last time, Pip, I thought I’d foller.”\\n\\n“And Joe, I am very glad you did so.”\\n\\n“Thankee, Pip.”\\n\\n“You may be sure, dear Joe,” I went on, after we had shaken hands,\\n“that I shall never forget you.”\\n\\n“No, no, Pip!” said Joe, in a comfortable tone, “_I_’m sure of that.\\nAy, ay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well\\nround in a man’s mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time\\nto get it well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn’t it?”\\n\\nSomehow, I was not best pleased with Joe’s being so mightily secure of\\nme. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,\\n“It does you credit, Pip,” or something of that sort. Therefore, I made\\nno remark on Joe’s first head; merely saying as to his second, that the\\ntidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a\\ngentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I\\nwere one.\\n\\n“Have you though?” said Joe. “Astonishing!”\\n\\n“It’s a pity now, Joe,” said I, “that you did not get on a little more,\\nwhen we had our lessons here; isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Well, I don’t know,” returned Joe. “I’m so awful dull. I’m only master\\nof my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it’s\\nno more of a pity now, than it was—this day twelvemonth—don’t you see?”\\n\\nWhat I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to\\ndo something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he had\\nbeen better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectly\\ninnocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to\\nBiddy in preference.\\n\\nSo, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our\\nlittle garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a\\ngeneral way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never\\nforget her, said I had a favour to ask of her.\\n\\n“And it is, Biddy,” said I, “that you will not omit any opportunity of\\nhelping Joe on, a little.”\\n\\n“How helping him on?” asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.\\n\\n“Well! Joe is a dear good fellow,—in fact, I think he is the dearest\\nfellow that ever lived,—but he is rather backward in some things. For\\ninstance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.”\\n\\nAlthough I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her\\neyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.\\n\\n“O, his manners! won’t his manners do then?” asked Biddy, plucking a\\nblack-currant leaf.\\n\\n“My dear Biddy, they do very well here—”\\n\\n“O! they _do_ very well here?” interrupted Biddy, looking closely at\\nthe leaf in her hand.\\n\\n“Hear me out,—but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I\\nshall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would\\nhardly do him justice.”\\n\\n“And don’t you think he knows that?” asked Biddy.\\n\\nIt was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most\\ndistant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,—\\n\\n“Biddy, what do you mean?”\\n\\nBiddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,—and the\\nsmell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that\\nevening in the little garden by the side of the lane,—said, “Have you\\nnever considered that he may be proud?”\\n\\n“Proud?” I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.\\n\\n“O! there are many kinds of pride,” said Biddy, looking full at me and\\nshaking her head; “pride is not all of one kind—”\\n\\n“Well? What are you stopping for?” said I.\\n\\n“Not all of one kind,” resumed Biddy. “He may be too proud to let any\\none take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills\\nwell and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it\\nsounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I\\ndo.”\\n\\n“Now, Biddy,” said I, “I am very sorry to see this in you. I did not\\nexpect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You\\nare dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can’t help\\nshowing it.”\\n\\n“If you have the heart to think so,” returned Biddy, “say so. Say so\\nover and over again, if you have the heart to think so.”\\n\\n“If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,” said I, in a\\nvirtuous and superior tone; “don’t put it off upon me. I am very sorry\\nto see it, and it’s a—it’s a bad side of human nature. I did intend to\\nask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was\\ngone, of improving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am\\nextremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy,” I repeated. “It’s a—it’s a\\nbad side of human nature.”\\n\\n“Whether you scold me or approve of me,” returned poor Biddy, “you may\\nequally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, at\\nall times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make no\\ndifference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be\\nunjust neither,” said Biddy, turning away her head.\\n\\nI again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in\\nwhich sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to\\nthink I was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy,\\nand Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and\\ntook a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very\\nsorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright\\nfortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.\\n\\nBut, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency\\nto Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I\\nhad, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,\\nand presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his\\nbreakfast in the parlour behind his shop, and who did not think it\\nworth his while to come out to me, but called me in to him.\\n\\n“Well!” said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. “How are\\nyou, and what can I do for you?”\\n\\nMr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds, and was\\nslipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was a\\nprosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous\\nlittle garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let\\ninto the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that\\nheaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags.\\n\\n“Mr. Trabb,” said I, “it’s an unpleasant thing to have to mention,\\nbecause it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome\\nproperty.”\\n\\nA change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up\\nfrom the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming,\\n“Lord bless my soul!”\\n\\n“I am going up to my guardian in London,” said I, casually drawing some\\nguineas out of my pocket and looking at them; “and I want a fashionable\\nsuit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,” I added—otherwise I\\nthought he might only pretend to make them, “with ready money.”\\n\\n“My dear sir,” said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened\\nhis arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each\\nelbow, “don’t hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate\\nyou? Would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop?”\\n\\nMr. Trabb’s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.\\nWhen I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his\\nlabours by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into\\nthe shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible\\ncorners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with\\nany blacksmith, alive or dead.\\n\\n“Hold that noise,” said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, “or\\nI’ll knock your head off!—Do me the favour to be seated, sir. Now,\\nthis,” said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out\\nin a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand\\nunder it to show the gloss, “is a very sweet article. I can recommend\\nit for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you\\nshall see some others. Give me Number Four, you!” (To the boy, and with\\na dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant’s\\nbrushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)\\n\\nMr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had\\ndeposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.\\nThen he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. “And let\\nme have none of your tricks here,” said Mr. Trabb, “or you shall repent\\nit, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.”\\n\\nMr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential\\nconfidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an\\narticle much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it\\nwould ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished\\nfellow-townsman’s (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having\\nworn. “Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,” said Mr.\\nTrabb to the boy after that, “or shall I kick you out of the shop and\\nbring them myself?”\\n\\nI selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb’s\\njudgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured. For although Mr.\\nTrabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented\\nwith it, he said apologetically that it “wouldn’t do under existing\\ncircumstances, sir,—wouldn’t do at all.” So, Mr. Trabb measured and\\ncalculated me in the parlour, as if I were an estate and he the finest\\nspecies of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I\\nfelt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his\\npains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles\\nto Mr. Pumblechook’s on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand\\nupon the parlour lock, “I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be\\nexpected to patronise local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a\\nturn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem\\nit. Good-morning, sir, much obliged.—Door!”\\n\\nThe last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what\\nit meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his\\nhands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money\\nwas, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb’s boy.\\n\\nAfter this memorable event, I went to the hatter’s, and the\\nbootmaker’s, and the hosier’s, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard’s\\ndog whose outfit required the services of so many trades. I also went\\nto the coach-office and took my place for seven o’clock on Saturday\\nmorning. It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come\\ninto a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect,\\nit followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention\\ndiverted through the window by the High Street, and concentrated his\\nmind upon me. When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my\\nsteps towards Pumblechook’s, and, as I approached that gentleman’s\\nplace of business, I saw him standing at his door.\\n\\nHe was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out early with\\nthe chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He had\\nprepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlour, and he too ordered\\nhis shopman to “come out of the gangway” as my sacred person passed.\\n\\n“My dear friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when\\nhe and I and the collation were alone, “I give you joy of your good\\nfortune. Well deserved, well deserved!”\\n\\nThis was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of\\nexpressing himself.\\n\\n“To think,” said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for\\nsome moments, “that I should have been the humble instrument of leading\\nup to this, is a proud reward.”\\n\\nI begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said\\nor hinted, on that point.\\n\\n“My dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook; “if you will allow me to\\ncall you so—”\\n\\nI murmured “Certainly,” and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands\\nagain, and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an\\nemotional appearance, though it was rather low down, “My dear young\\nfriend, rely upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping\\nthe fact before the mind of Joseph.—Joseph!” said Mr. Pumblechook, in\\nthe way of a compassionate adjuration. “Joseph!! Joseph!!!” Thereupon\\nhe shook his head and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in\\nJoseph.\\n\\n“But my dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “you must be hungry,\\nyou must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the\\nBoar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here’s one or two\\nlittle things had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise.\\nBut do I,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he\\nhad sat down, “see afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times of\\nhappy infancy? And may I—_may_ I—?”\\n\\nThis May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he was\\nfervent, and then sat down again.\\n\\n“Here is wine,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune,\\nand may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment! And yet I\\ncannot,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, “see afore me One—and\\nlikewise drink to One—without again expressing—May I—_may_ I—?”\\n\\nI said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his\\nglass and turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turned\\nmyself upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more\\ndirect to my head.\\n\\nMr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of\\ntongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and\\ntook, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. “Ah! poultry,\\npoultry! You little thought,” said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophising the\\nfowl in the dish, “when you was a young fledgling, what was in store\\nfor you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this\\nhumble roof for one as—Call it a weakness, if you will,” said Mr.\\nPumblechook, getting up again, “but may I? _may_ I—?”\\n\\nIt began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so he\\ndid it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself\\nwith my knife, I don’t know.\\n\\n“And your sister,” he resumed, after a little steady eating, “which had\\nthe honour of bringing you up by hand! It’s a sad picter, to reflect\\nthat she’s no longer equal to fully understanding the honour. May—”\\n\\nI saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.\\n\\n“We’ll drink her health,” said I.\\n\\n“Ah!” cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid\\nwith admiration, “that’s the way you know ’em, sir!” (I don’t know who\\nSir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person\\npresent); “that’s the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever\\nforgiving and ever affable. It might,” said the servile Pumblechook,\\nputting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, “to a\\ncommon person, have the appearance of repeating—but _may_ I—?”\\n\\nWhen he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. “Let\\nus never be blind,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “to her faults of temper, but\\nit is to be hoped she meant well.”\\n\\nAt about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in\\nthe face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.\\n\\nI mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes\\nsent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. I\\nmentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,\\nand he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he\\nintimated, worthy of my confidence, and—in short, might he? Then he\\nasked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we\\nhad gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he\\nhad ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken\\nten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he\\nnever had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of\\nhearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling\\nconvinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was a\\nsensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.\\n\\nBy degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask\\nmy advice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was\\nan opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and\\nseed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred\\nbefore in that or any other neighbourhood. What alone was wanting to\\nthe realisation of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.\\nThose were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him\\n(Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through\\na sleeping partner, sir,—which sleeping partner would have nothing to\\ndo but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine the\\nbooks,—and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his\\npocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,—it appeared to him that that\\nmight be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with\\nproperty, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?\\nHe had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it\\nas my opinion. “Wait a bit!” The united vastness and distinctness of\\nthis view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake\\nhands with me, but said he really must,—and did.\\n\\nWe drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and\\nover again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don’t know what mark), and\\nto render me efficient and constant service (I don’t know what\\nservice). He also made known to me for the first time in my life, and\\ncertainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had\\nalways said of me, “That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun’\\nwill be no common fortun’.” He said with a tearful smile that it was a\\nsingular thing to think of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out\\ninto the air, with a dim perception that there was something unwonted\\nin the conduct of the sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got\\nto the turnpike without having taken any account of the road.\\n\\nThere, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook’s hailing me. He was a long way\\ndown the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to\\nstop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.\\n\\n“No, my dear friend,” said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.\\n“Not if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without\\nthat affability on your part.—May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?\\n_May_ I?”\\n\\nWe shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young\\ncarter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed me\\nand stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the\\nroad; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge\\nbefore I pursued my way home.\\n\\nI had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little\\nI possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that\\nsame afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want\\nnext morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.\\n\\nSo, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I\\nwent to Mr. Pumblechook’s, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to\\nMiss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook’s own room was given up to me to dress\\nin, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My\\nclothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new and\\neagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell a\\ntrifle short of the wearer’s expectation. But after I had had my new\\nsuit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of\\nposturing with Mr. Pumblechook’s very limited dressing-glass, in the\\nfutile endeavour to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being\\nmarket morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off, Mr.\\nPumblechook was not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant to\\nleave, and was not likely to shake hands with him again before\\ndeparting. This was all as it should be, and I went out in my new\\narray, fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman, and suspicious\\nafter all that I was at a personal disadvantage, something like Joe’s\\nin his Sunday suit.\\n\\nI went circuitously to Miss Havisham’s by all the back ways, and rang\\nat the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my\\ngloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when\\nshe saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned\\nfrom brown to green and yellow.\\n\\n“You?” said she. “You? Good gracious! What do you want?”\\n\\n“I am going to London, Miss Pocket,” said I, “and want to say good-bye\\nto Miss Havisham.”\\n\\nI was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went\\nto ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returned\\nand took me up, staring at me all the way.\\n\\nMiss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread\\ntable, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore,\\nand at the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was then\\njust abreast of the rotted bride-cake.\\n\\n“Don’t go, Sarah,” she said. “Well, Pip?”\\n\\n“I start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,” I was exceedingly\\ncareful what I said, “and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking\\nleave of you.”\\n\\n“This is a gay figure, Pip,” said she, making her crutch stick play\\nround me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were\\nbestowing the finishing gift.\\n\\n“I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss\\nHavisham,” I murmured. “And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!”\\n\\n“Ay, ay!” said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with\\ndelight. “I have seen Mr. Jaggers. _I_ have heard about it, Pip. So you\\ngo to-morrow?”\\n\\n“Yes, Miss Havisham.”\\n\\n“And you are adopted by a rich person?”\\n\\n“Yes, Miss Havisham.”\\n\\n“Not named?”\\n\\n“No, Miss Havisham.”\\n\\n“And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?”\\n\\n“Yes, Miss Havisham.”\\n\\nShe quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her\\nenjoyment of Sarah Pocket’s jealous dismay. “Well!” she went on; “you\\nhave a promising career before you. Be good—deserve it—and abide by Mr.\\nJaggers’s instructions.” She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and\\nSarah’s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile.\\n“Good-bye, Pip!—you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.”\\n\\n“Yes, Miss Havisham.”\\n\\n“Good-bye, Pip!”\\n\\nShe stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to my\\nlips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came\\nnaturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket\\nwith triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with\\nboth her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly\\nlighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.\\n\\nSarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen\\nout. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree\\nconfounded. I said “Good-bye, Miss Pocket;” but she merely stared, and\\ndid not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the\\nhouse, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook’s, took off my new\\nclothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,\\ncarrying it—to speak the truth—much more at my ease too, though I had\\nthe bundle to carry.\\n\\nAnd now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had run\\nout fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more\\nsteadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled\\naway, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more\\nappreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I\\ndressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my\\nsplendour\\t until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion,\\ngraced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish\\nwith. We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in\\nspirits.\\n\\nI was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little\\nhand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all\\nalone. I am afraid—sore afraid—that this purpose originated in my sense\\nof the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to the\\ncoach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of\\nthis taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on\\nthis last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had\\nan impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in\\nthe morning. I did not.\\n\\nAll night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places\\ninstead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now\\npigs, now men,—never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me\\nuntil the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and\\npartly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in\\ntaking it fell asleep.\\n\\nBiddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not\\nsleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when\\nI started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the\\nafternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking\\nof the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go\\ndownstairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and\\nunstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again,\\nuntil Biddy called to me that I was late.\\n\\nIt was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,\\nsaying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,\\n“Well! I suppose I must be off!” and then I kissed my sister who was\\nlaughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy,\\nand threw my arms around Joe’s neck. Then I took up my little\\nportmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I\\npresently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing\\nan old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped\\nthen, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above\\nhis head, crying huskily “Hooroar!” and Biddy put her apron to her\\nface.\\n\\nI walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had\\nsupposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to\\nhave had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High\\nStreet. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very\\npeaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to\\nshow me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all\\nbeyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave\\nand sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the\\nvillage, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, “Good-bye, O my dear,\\ndear friend!”\\n\\nHeaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain\\nupon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was\\nbetter after I had cried than before,—more sorry, more aware of my own\\ningratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe\\nwith me then.\\n\\nSo subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the\\ncourse of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was\\nclear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would\\nnot get down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another\\nevening at home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made\\nup my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite\\npracticable to get down and walk back, when we changed again. And while\\nI was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact\\nresemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us, and my\\nheart would beat high.—As if he could possibly be there!\\n\\nWe changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to\\ngo back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and\\nthe world lay spread before me.\\n\\nThis is the end of the first stage of Pip’s expectations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XX.\\n\\n\\nThe journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five\\nhours. It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by\\nwhich I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about\\nthe Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.\\n\\nWe Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was\\ntreasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything:\\notherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I\\nmight have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly,\\ncrooked, narrow, and dirty.\\n\\nMr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and\\nhe had written after it on his card, “just out of Smithfield, and close\\nby the coach-office.” Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to\\nhave as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed\\nme up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier\\nof steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on\\nhis box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old\\nweather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a\\nwork of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets\\noutside, and ragged things behind for I don’t know how many footmen to\\nhold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from\\nyielding to the temptation.\\n\\nI had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a\\nstraw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the\\nhorses’ nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman\\nbeginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop\\nwe presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open\\ndoor, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.\\n\\n“How much?” I asked the coachman.\\n\\nThe coachman answered, “A shilling—unless you wish to make it more.”\\n\\nI naturally said I had no wish to make it more.\\n\\n“Then it must be a shilling,” observed the coachman. “I don’t want to\\nget into trouble. _I_ know _him_!” He darkly closed an eye at Mr.\\nJaggers’s name, and shook his head.\\n\\nWhen he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the\\nascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his\\nmind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my\\nhand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?\\n\\n“He is not,” returned the clerk. “He is in Court at present. Am I\\naddressing Mr. Pip?”\\n\\nI signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.\\n\\n“Mr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn’t say how\\nlong he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time\\nbeing valuable, that he won’t be longer than he can help.”\\n\\nWith those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner\\nchamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a\\nvelveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on\\nbeing interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.\\n\\n“Go and wait outside, Mike,” said the clerk.\\n\\nI began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk\\nshoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,\\nand tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.\\n\\nMr. Jaggers’s room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most\\ndismal place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head,\\nand the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted\\nthemselves to peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers\\nabout, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd\\nobjects about, that I should not have expected to see,—such as an old\\nrusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and\\npackages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly\\nswollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers’s own high-backed\\nchair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,\\nlike a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and\\nbit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the\\nclients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the\\nwall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers’s chair, being greasy with\\nshoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled\\nforth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being\\nturned out.\\n\\nI sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers’s\\nchair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I\\ncalled to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to\\neverybody else’s disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many\\nother clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have\\nthe same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what\\nwas the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came\\nthere. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers’s\\nfamily, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such\\nill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the\\nblacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.\\nOf course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits\\nmay have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and\\ngrit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in\\nMr. Jaggers’s close room, until I really could not bear the two casts\\non the shelf above Mr. Jaggers’s chair, and got up and went out.\\n\\nWhen I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I\\nwaited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into\\nSmithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being\\nall asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to\\nme. So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a\\nstreet where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul’s bulging at me\\nfrom behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate\\nPrison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered\\nwith straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and\\nfrom the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits\\nand beer, I inferred that the trials were on.\\n\\nWhile I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk\\nminister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a\\ntrial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half\\na crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice\\nin his wig and robes,—mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and\\npresently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I\\ndeclined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as\\nto take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also\\nwhere people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors’\\nDoor, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest\\nof that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that “four on ’em”\\nwould come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the\\nmorning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a\\nsickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice’s\\nproprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his\\npocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently not\\nbelonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had\\nbought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought\\nmyself well rid of him for a shilling.\\n\\nI dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I\\nfound he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour\\nof Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became\\naware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as\\nI. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew\\nClose, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the\\npavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when\\nthey first passed me, that “Jaggers would do it if it was to be done.”\\nThere was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and\\none of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted\\nher by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, “Jaggers\\nis for him, ’Melia, and what more _could_ you have?” There was a\\nred-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering\\nthere, in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand;\\nand while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a\\nhighly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a\\nlamp-post and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the\\nwords, “O Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth,\\ngive me Jaggerth!” These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian\\nmade a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than\\never.\\n\\nAt length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close\\ninto Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards\\nme. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there\\nwas quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder and\\nwalking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed\\nhimself to his followers.\\n\\nFirst, he took the two secret men.\\n\\n“Now, I have nothing to say to _you_,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\\nfinger at them. “I want to know no more than I know. As to the result,\\nit’s a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you\\npaid Wemmick?”\\n\\n“We made the money up this morning, sir,” said one of the men,\\nsubmissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers’s face.\\n\\n“I don’t ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it\\nup at all. Has Wemmick got it?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said both the men together.\\n\\n“Very well; then you may go. Now, I won’t have it!” said Mr Jaggers,\\nwaving his hand at them to put them behind him. “If you say a word to\\nme, I’ll throw up the case.”\\n\\n“We thought, Mr. Jaggers—” one of the men began, pulling off his hat.\\n\\n“That’s what I told you not to do,” said Mr. Jaggers. “_You_ thought! I\\nthink for you; that’s enough for you. If I want you, I know where to\\nfind you; I don’t want you to find me. Now I won’t have it. I won’t\\nhear a word.”\\n\\nThe two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind\\nagain, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.\\n\\n“And now _you_!” said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on\\nthe two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly\\nseparated,—“Oh! Amelia, is it?”\\n\\n“Yes, Mr. Jaggers.”\\n\\n“And do you remember,” retorted Mr. Jaggers, “that but for me you\\nwouldn’t be here and couldn’t be here?”\\n\\n“O yes, sir!” exclaimed both women together. “Lord bless you, sir, well\\nwe knows that!”\\n\\n“Then why,” said Mr. Jaggers, “do you come here?”\\n\\n“My Bill, sir!” the crying woman pleaded.\\n\\n“Now, I tell you what!” said Mr. Jaggers. “Once for all. If you don’t\\nknow that your Bill’s in good hands, I know it. And if you come here\\nbothering about your Bill, I’ll make an example of both your Bill and\\nyou, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?”\\n\\n“O yes, sir! Every farden.”\\n\\n“Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another\\nword—one single word—and Wemmick shall give you your money back.”\\n\\nThis terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately. No\\none remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the\\nskirts of Mr. Jaggers’s coat to his lips several times.\\n\\n“I don’t know this man!” said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating\\nstrain: “What does this fellow want?”\\n\\n“Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?”\\n\\n“Who’s he?” said Mr. Jaggers. “Let go of my coat.”\\n\\nThe suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing\\nit, replied, “Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.”\\n\\n“You’re too late,” said Mr. Jaggers. “I am over the way.”\\n\\n“Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!” cried my excitable acquaintance,\\nturning white, “don’t thay you’re again Habraham Latharuth!”\\n\\n“I am,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and there’s an end of it. Get out of the\\nway.”\\n\\n“Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen’th gone to Mithter\\nWemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter\\nJaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you’d have the condethenthun\\nto be bought off from the t’other thide—at hany thuperior prithe!—money\\nno object!—Mithter Jaggerth—Mithter—!”\\n\\nMy guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and\\nleft him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without further\\ninterruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and\\nthe man in velveteen with the fur cap.\\n\\n“Here’s Mike,” said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and\\napproaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.\\n\\n“Oh!” said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of\\nhair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling\\nat the bell-rope; “your man comes on this afternoon. Well?”\\n\\n“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a\\nconstitutional cold; “arter a deal o’ trouble, I’ve found one, sir, as\\nmight do.”\\n\\n“What is he prepared to swear?”\\n\\n“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this\\ntime; “in a general way, anythink.”\\n\\nMr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. “Now, I warned you before,”\\nsaid he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, “that if you\\never presumed to talk in that way here, I’d make an example of you. You\\ninfernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?”\\n\\nThe client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious\\nwhat he had done.\\n\\n“Spooney!” said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his\\nelbow. “Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?”\\n\\n“Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,” said my guardian, very sternly,\\n“once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is\\nprepared to swear?”\\n\\nMike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson\\nfrom his face, and slowly replied, “Ayther to character, or to having\\nbeen in his company and never left him all the night in question.”\\n\\n“Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?”\\n\\nMike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the\\nceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before\\nbeginning to reply in a nervous manner, “We’ve dressed him up like—”\\nwhen my guardian blustered out,—\\n\\n“What? You WILL, will you?”\\n\\n(“Spooney!” added the clerk again, with another stir.)\\n\\nAfter some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:—\\n\\n“He is dressed like a ’spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.”\\n\\n“Is he here?” asked my guardian.\\n\\n“I left him,” said Mike, “a setting on some doorsteps round the\\ncorner.”\\n\\n“Take him past that window, and let me see him.”\\n\\nThe window indicated was the office window. We all three went to it,\\nbehind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an\\naccidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short\\nsuit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was\\nnot by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of\\nrecovery, which was painted over.\\n\\n“Tell him to take his witness away directly,” said my guardian to the\\nclerk, in extreme disgust, “and ask him what he means by bringing such\\na fellow as that.”\\n\\nMy guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,\\nstanding, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed\\nto bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements\\nhe had made for me. I was to go to “Barnard’s Inn,” to young Mr.\\nPocket’s rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I\\nwas to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go\\nwith him to his father’s house on a visit, that I might try how I liked\\nit. Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,—it was a very liberal\\none,—and had handed to me from one of my guardian’s drawers, the cards\\nof certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,\\nand such other things as I could in reason want. “You will find your\\ncredit good, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt\\nlike a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, “but I shall by\\nthis means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find\\nyou outrunning the constable. Of course you’ll go wrong somehow, but\\nthat’s no fault of mine.”\\n\\nAfter I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked\\nMr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth\\nwhile, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me,\\nif I pleased.\\n\\nI then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk\\nwas rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and I\\naccompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.\\nWe found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way\\namong them by saying coolly yet decisively, “I tell you it’s no use; he\\nwon’t have a word to say to one of you;” and we soon got clear of them,\\nand went on side by side.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXI.\\n\\n\\nCasting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was\\nlike in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in\\nstature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have\\nbeen imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some\\nmarks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been\\nsofter and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.\\nThe chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment\\nover his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them\\noff. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his\\nlinen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for\\nhe wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a\\nlady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too,\\nthat several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were\\nquite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering\\neyes,—small, keen, and black,—and thin wide mottled lips. He had had\\nthem, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.\\n\\n“So you were never in London before?” said Mr. Wemmick to me.\\n\\n“No,” said I.\\n\\n“_I_ was new here once,” said Mr. Wemmick. “Rum to think of now!”\\n\\n“You are well acquainted with it now?”\\n\\n“Why, yes,” said Mr. Wemmick. “I know the moves of it.”\\n\\n“Is it a very wicked place?” I asked, more for the sake of saying\\nsomething than for information.\\n\\n“You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are\\nplenty of people anywhere, who’ll do that for you.”\\n\\n“If there is bad blood between you and them,” said I, to soften it off\\na little.\\n\\n“O! I don’t know about bad blood,” returned Mr. Wemmick; “there’s not\\nmuch bad blood about. They’ll do it, if there’s anything to be got by\\nit.”\\n\\n“That makes it worse.”\\n\\n“You think so?” returned Mr. Wemmick. “Much about the same, I should\\nsay.”\\n\\nHe wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before\\nhim: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the\\nstreets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a\\nmouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the\\ntop of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical\\nappearance, and that he was not smiling at all.\\n\\n“Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?” I asked Mr. Wemmick.\\n\\n“Yes,” said he, nodding in the direction. “At Hammersmith, west of\\nLondon.”\\n\\n“Is that far?”\\n\\n“Well! Say five miles.”\\n\\n“Do you know him?”\\n\\n“Why, you’re a regular cross-examiner!” said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me\\nwith an approving air. “Yes, I know him. _I_ know him!”\\n\\nThere was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of\\nthese words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways\\nat his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,\\nwhen he said here we were at Barnard’s Inn. My depression was not\\nalleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment\\nto be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town\\nwas a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a\\ndisembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection\\nof shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club\\nfor Tom-cats.\\n\\nWe entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an\\nintroductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me\\nlike a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in\\nit, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the\\nmost dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever\\nseen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those\\nhouses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and\\ncurtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable\\nmakeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms,\\nas if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of\\nBarnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the\\npresent occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy\\nmourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard,\\nand it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and\\nhumiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry\\nrot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and\\ncellar,—rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand\\nbesides—addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned,\\n“Try Barnard’s Mixture.”\\n\\nSo imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great\\nexpectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. “Ah!” said he,\\nmistaking me; “the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does\\nme.”\\n\\nHe led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,—which\\nappeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of\\nthose days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find\\nthemselves without the means of coming down,—to a set of chambers on\\nthe top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was\\na label on the letter-box, “Return shortly.”\\n\\n“He hardly thought you’d come so soon,” Mr. Wemmick explained. “You\\ndon’t want me any more?”\\n\\n“No, thank you,” said I.\\n\\n“As I keep the cash,” Mr. Wemmick observed, “we shall most likely meet\\npretty often. Good day.”\\n\\n“Good day.”\\n\\nI put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he\\nthought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting\\nhimself,—\\n\\n“To be sure! Yes. You’re in the habit of shaking hands?”\\n\\nI was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,\\nbut said yes.\\n\\n“I have got so out of it!” said Mr. Wemmick,—“except at last. Very\\nglad, I’m sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!”\\n\\nWhen we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window\\nand had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it\\ncame down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not\\nput my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view\\nof the Inn through the window’s encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully\\nlooking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.\\n\\nMr. Pocket, Junior’s, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly\\nmaddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written my\\nname with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the\\nwindow, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose\\nbefore me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a\\nmember of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under\\neach arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of\\nbreath.\\n\\n“Mr. Pip?” said he.\\n\\n“Mr. Pocket?” said I.\\n\\n“Dear me!” he exclaimed. “I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a\\ncoach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would\\ncome by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,—not\\nthat that is any excuse,—for I thought, coming from the country, you\\nmight like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden\\nMarket to get it good.”\\n\\nFor a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my\\nhead. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think\\nthis was a dream.\\n\\n“Dear me!” said Mr. Pocket, Junior. “This door sticks so!”\\n\\nAs he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while\\nthe paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold\\nthem. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with\\nthe door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,\\nthat he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite\\ndoor, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start\\nout of my head, and as if this must be a dream.\\n\\n“Pray come in,” said Mr. Pocket, Junior. “Allow me to lead the way. I\\nam rather bare here, but I hope you’ll be able to make out tolerably\\nwell till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably\\nthrough to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk\\nabout London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As\\nto our table, you won’t find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied\\nfrom our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your\\nexpense, such being Mr. Jaggers’s directions. As to our lodging, it’s\\nnot by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my\\nfather hasn’t anything to give me, and I shouldn’t be willing to take\\nit, if he had. This is our sitting-room,—just such chairs and tables\\nand carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You\\nmustn’t give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors,\\nbecause they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my little\\nbedroom; rather musty, but Barnard’s _is_ musty. This is your bedroom;\\nthe furniture’s hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the\\npurpose; if you should want anything, I’ll go and fetch it. The\\nchambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan’t\\nfight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your pardon, you’re holding the\\nfruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quite\\nashamed.”\\n\\nAs I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags,\\nOne, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I\\nknew to be in mine, and he said, falling back,—\\n\\n“Lord bless me, you’re the prowling boy!”\\n\\n“And you,” said I, “are the pale young gentleman!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXII.\\n\\n\\nThe pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in\\nBarnard’s Inn, until we both burst out laughing. “The idea of its being\\nyou!” said he. “The idea of its being _you_!” said I. And then we\\ncontemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. “Well!” said the\\npale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humouredly, “it’s all\\nover now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you’ll forgive\\nme for having knocked you about so.”\\n\\nI derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the\\npale young gentleman’s name) still rather confounded his intention with\\nhis execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.\\n\\n“You hadn’t come into your good fortune at that time?” said Herbert\\nPocket.\\n\\n“No,” said I.\\n\\n“No,” he acquiesced: “I heard it had happened very lately. _I_ was\\nrather on the lookout for good fortune then.”\\n\\n“Indeed?”\\n\\n“Yes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy\\nto me. But she couldn’t,—at all events, she didn’t.”\\n\\nI thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.\\n\\n“Bad taste,” said Herbert, laughing, “but a fact. Yes, she had sent for\\nme on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I\\nsuppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been\\nwhat-you-may-called it to Estella.”\\n\\n“What’s that?” I asked, with sudden gravity.\\n\\nHe was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his\\nattention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.\\n“Affianced,” he explained, still busy with the fruit. “Betrothed.\\nEngaged. What’s-his-named. Any word of that sort.”\\n\\n“How did you bear your disappointment?” I asked.\\n\\n“Pooh!” said he, “I didn’t care much for it. _She’s_ a Tartar.”\\n\\n“Miss Havisham?”\\n\\n“I don’t say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl’s hard and\\nhaughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by\\nMiss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.”\\n\\n“What relation is she to Miss Havisham?”\\n\\n“None,” said he. “Only adopted.”\\n\\n“Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?”\\n\\n“Lord, Mr. Pip!” said he. “Don’t you know?”\\n\\n“No,” said I.\\n\\n“Dear me! It’s quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And\\nnow let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come\\nthere, that day?”\\n\\nI told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst\\nout laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn’t ask\\nhim if _he_ was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly\\nestablished.\\n\\n“Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?” he went on.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“You know he is Miss Havisham’s man of business and solicitor, and has\\nher confidence when nobody else has?”\\n\\nThis was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with\\na constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers\\nin Miss Havisham’s house on the very day of our combat, but never at\\nany other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having\\never seen me there.\\n\\n“He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he\\ncalled on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father\\nfrom his connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham’s\\ncousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he\\nis a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.”\\n\\nHerbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.\\nI had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who\\nmore strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural\\nincapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something\\nwonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the\\nsame time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I\\ndon’t know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first\\noccasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what\\nmeans.\\n\\nHe was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered\\nlanguor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did\\nnot seem indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face,\\nbut it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful.\\nHis figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had\\ntaken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be\\nlight and young. Whether Mr. Trabb’s local work would have sat more\\ngracefully on him than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious\\nthat he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carried\\noff my new suit.\\n\\nAs he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a\\nbad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story,\\nand laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.\\nI further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a\\ncountry place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would\\ntake it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever\\nhe saw me at a loss or going wrong.\\n\\n“With pleasure,” said he, “though I venture to prophesy that you’ll\\nwant very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I\\nshould like to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me\\nthe favour to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?”\\n\\nI thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my\\nChristian name was Philip.\\n\\n“I don’t take to Philip,” said he, smiling, “for it sounds like a moral\\nboy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,\\nor so fat that he couldn’t see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that\\nhe locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a\\nbird’s-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in\\nthe neighbourhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious,\\nand you have been a blacksmith,—would you mind it?”\\n\\n“I shouldn’t mind anything that you propose,” I answered, “but I don’t\\nunderstand you.”\\n\\n“Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There’s a charming piece of\\nmusic by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.”\\n\\n“I should like it very much.”\\n\\n“Then, my dear Handel,” said he, turning round as the door opened,\\n“here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the\\ntable, because the dinner is of your providing.”\\n\\nThis I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a\\nnice little dinner,—seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor’s Feast,—and it\\nacquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent\\ncircumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.\\nThis again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the\\nbanquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have\\nsaid, the lap of luxury,—being entirely furnished forth from the\\ncoffee-house,—the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a\\ncomparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter\\nthe wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell\\nover them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the\\nbookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into\\nmy bed in the next room,—where I found much of its parsley and butter\\nin a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made\\nthe feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my\\npleasure was without alloy.\\n\\nWe had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his\\npromise to tell me about Miss Havisham.\\n\\n“True,” he replied. “I’ll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the\\ntopic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put\\nthe knife in the mouth,—for fear of accidents,—and that while the fork\\nis reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It\\nis scarcely worth mentioning, only it’s as well to do as other people\\ndo. Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This\\nhas two advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is\\nthe object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening\\noysters, on the part of the right elbow.”\\n\\nHe offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we\\nboth laughed and I scarcely blushed.\\n\\n“Now,” he pursued, “concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must\\nknow, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her\\nfather denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in\\nyour part of the world, and was a brewer. I don’t know why it should be\\na crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you\\ncannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was\\nand brew. You see it every day.”\\n\\n“Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?” said I.\\n\\n“Not on any account,” returned Herbert; “but a public-house may keep a\\ngentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his\\ndaughter.”\\n\\n“Miss Havisham was an only child?” I hazarded.\\n\\n“Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child; she\\nhad a half-brother. Her father privately married again—his cook, I\\nrather think.”\\n\\n“I thought he was proud,” said I.\\n\\n“My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,\\nbecause he was proud, and in course of time _she_ died. When she was\\ndead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then\\nthe son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are\\nacquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,\\nextravagant, undutiful,—altogether bad. At last his father disinherited\\nhim; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though\\nnot nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.—Take another glass of wine,\\nand excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to\\nbe so strictly conscientious in emptying one’s glass, as to turn it\\nbottom upwards with the rim on one’s nose.”\\n\\nI had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I\\nthanked him, and apologised. He said, “Not at all,” and resumed.\\n\\n“Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after\\nas a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what\\nwith debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.\\nThere were stronger differences between him and her than there had been\\nbetween him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a\\ndeep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father’s\\nanger. Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,—merely breaking off,\\nmy dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a\\ntumbler.”\\n\\nWhy I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to\\nsay. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a\\nmuch better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it\\nwithin those limits. Again I thanked him and apologised, and again he\\nsaid in the cheerfullest manner, “Not at all, I am sure!” and resumed.\\n\\n“There appeared upon the scene—say at the races, or the public balls,\\nor anywhere else you like—a certain man, who made love to Miss\\nHavisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,\\nbefore you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that\\nhe was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he\\nwas not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a\\ngentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a\\nprinciple of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever\\nwas, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no\\nvarnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you\\nput on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued\\nMiss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believe\\nshe had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the\\nsusceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and she\\npassionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized\\nhim. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got\\ngreat sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out\\nof a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his\\nfather) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband\\nhe must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in\\nMiss Havisham’s counsels, and she was too haughty and too much in love\\nto be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and scheming, with\\nthe exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving or\\njealous. The only independent one among them, he warned her that she\\nwas doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too\\nunreservedly in his power. She took the first opportunity of angrily\\nordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father has\\nnever seen her since.”\\n\\nI thought of her having said, “Matthew will come and see me at last\\nwhen I am laid dead upon that table;” and I asked Herbert whether his\\nfather was so inveterate against her?\\n\\n“It’s not that,” said he, “but she charged him, in the presence of her\\nintended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon\\nher for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would\\nlook true—even to him—and even to her. To return to the man and make an\\nend of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were\\nbought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were\\ninvited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter—”\\n\\n“Which she received,” I struck in, “when she was dressing for her\\nmarriage? At twenty minutes to nine?”\\n\\n“At the hour and minute,” said Herbert, nodding, “at which she\\nafterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it\\nmost heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can’t tell you, because I\\ndon’t know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she\\nlaid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never\\nsince looked upon the light of day.”\\n\\n“Is that all the story?” I asked, after considering it.\\n\\n“All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it\\nout for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss\\nHavisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was\\nabsolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one\\nthing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced\\nconfidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it\\nwas a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.”\\n\\n“I wonder he didn’t marry her and get all the property,” said I.\\n\\n“He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have\\nbeen a part of her half-brother’s scheme,” said Herbert. “Mind! I don’t\\nknow that.”\\n\\n“What became of the two men?” I asked, after again considering the\\nsubject.\\n\\n“They fell into deeper shame and degradation—if there can be deeper—and\\nruin.”\\n\\n“Are they alive now?”\\n\\n“I don’t know.”\\n\\n“You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but\\nadopted. When adopted?”\\n\\nHerbert shrugged his shoulders. “There has always been an Estella,\\nsince I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now,\\nHandel,” said he, finally throwing off the story as it were, “there is\\na perfectly open understanding between us. All that I know about Miss\\nHavisham, you know.”\\n\\n“And all that I know,” I retorted, “you know.”\\n\\n“I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity\\nbetween you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your\\nadvancement in life,—namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to\\nwhom you owe it,—you may be very sure that it will never be encroached\\nupon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.”\\n\\nIn truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject\\ndone with, even though I should be under his father’s roof for years\\nand years to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I\\nfelt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as\\nI understood the fact myself.\\n\\nIt had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for\\nthe purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the\\nlighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this to\\nbe the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the\\ncourse of conversation, what he was? He replied, “A capitalist,—an\\nInsurer of Ships.” I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in\\nsearch of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, “In the\\nCity.”\\n\\nI had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in\\nthe City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer\\non his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible\\nhead open. But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd\\nimpression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.\\n\\n“I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in\\ninsuring ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut\\ninto the Direction. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of\\nthese things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on\\nmy own account. I think I shall trade,” said he, leaning back in his\\nchair, “to the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and\\nprecious woods. It’s an interesting trade.”\\n\\n“And the profits are large?” said I.\\n\\n“Tremendous!” said he.\\n\\nI wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than\\nmy own.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“I think I shall trade, also,” said he, putting his thumbs in his\\nwaist-coat pockets, “to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.\\nAlso to Ceylon, especially for elephants’ tusks.”\\n\\n“You will want a good many ships,” said I.\\n\\n“A perfect fleet,” said he.\\n\\nQuite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked\\nhim where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?\\n\\n“I haven’t begun insuring yet,” he replied. “I am looking about me.”\\n\\nSomehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard’s Inn. I said\\n(in a tone of conviction), “Ah-h!”\\n\\n“Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.”\\n\\n“Is a counting-house profitable?” I asked.\\n\\n“To—do you mean to the young fellow who’s in it?” he asked, in reply.\\n\\n“Yes; to you.”\\n\\n“Why, n-no; not to me.” He said this with the air of one carefully\\nreckoning up and striking a balance. “Not directly profitable. That is,\\nit doesn’t pay me anything, and I have to—keep myself.”\\n\\nThis certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as\\nif I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative\\ncapital from such a source of income.\\n\\n“But the thing is,” said Herbert Pocket, “that you look about you.\\n_That’s_ the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and\\nyou look about you.”\\n\\nIt struck me as a singular implication that you couldn’t be out of a\\ncounting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred\\nto his experience.\\n\\n“Then the time comes,” said Herbert, “when you see your opening. And\\nyou go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then\\nthere you are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing\\nto do but employ it.”\\n\\nThis was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden;\\nvery like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded\\nto his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took all\\nblows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then.\\nIt was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest\\nnecessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have\\nbeen sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.\\n\\nYet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so\\nunassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being\\npuffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways,\\nand we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the\\nstreets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to\\nchurch at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the\\nParks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe\\ndid.\\n\\nOn a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had\\nleft Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them\\npartook of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That\\nI could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on\\nthe very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of\\nimpossibilities, geographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the\\nLondon streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the\\ndusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I\\nhad put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of\\nnight, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning\\nabout Barnard’s Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my\\nheart.\\n\\nOn the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to the\\ncounting-house to report himself,—to look about him, too, I\\nsuppose,—and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or two\\nto attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It\\nappeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched\\nwere incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging\\nfrom the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday\\nmorning. Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my\\neyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard,\\nof a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into another\\nback second floor, rather than a look out.\\n\\nI waited about until it was noon, and I went upon ’Change, and I saw\\nfluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to\\nbe great merchants, though I couldn’t understand why they should all be\\nout of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a\\ncelebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have\\nbeen the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help\\nnoticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths\\nand knives and waiters’ clothes, than in the steaks. This collation\\ndisposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease, which was not\\ncharged for), we went back to Barnard’s Inn and got my little\\nportmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at\\ntwo or three o’clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk\\nto Mr. Pocket’s house. Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct\\ninto a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket’s children\\nwere playing about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my\\ninterests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr.\\nand Mrs. Pocket’s children were not growing up or being brought up, but\\nwere tumbling up.\\n\\nMrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with\\nher legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket’s two nurse-maids\\nwere looking about them while the children played. “Mamma,” said\\nHerbert, “this is young Mr. Pip.” Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me\\nwith an appearance of amiable dignity.\\n\\n“Master Alick and Miss Jane,” cried one of the nurses to two of the\\nchildren, “if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you’ll fall over\\ninto the river and be drownded, and what’ll your pa say then?”\\n\\nAt the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket’s handkerchief, and\\nsaid, “If that don’t make six times you’ve dropped it, Mum!” Upon which\\nMrs. Pocket laughed and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and settling\\nherself in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance\\nimmediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been\\nreading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines,\\nshe fixed her eyes upon me, and said, “I hope your mamma is quite\\nwell?” This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I\\nbegan saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such\\nperson I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have\\nbeen very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the\\nnurse came to my rescue.\\n\\n“Well!” she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, “if that don’t\\nmake seven times! What ARE you a-doing of this afternoon, Mum!” Mrs.\\nPocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable\\nsurprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of\\nrecognition, and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and forgot me, and went on\\nreading.\\n\\nI found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than\\nsix little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had\\nscarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the\\nregion of air, wailing dolefully.\\n\\n“If there ain’t Baby!” said Flopson, appearing to think it most\\nsurprising. “Make haste up, Millers.”\\n\\nMillers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by\\ndegrees the child’s wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a\\nyoung ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all\\nthe time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.\\n\\nWe were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any\\nrate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the\\nremarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed\\nnear Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and\\ntumbled over her,—always very much to her momentary astonishment, and\\ntheir own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for\\nthis surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to\\nspeculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,\\nwhich baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.\\nPocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby\\nand all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.\\n\\n“Gracious me, Flopson!” said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a\\nmoment, “everybody’s tumbling!”\\n\\n“Gracious you, indeed, Mum!” returned Flopson, very red in the face;\\n“what have you got there?”\\n\\n“_I_ got here, Flopson?” asked Mrs. Pocket.\\n\\n“Why, if it ain’t your footstool!” cried Flopson. “And if you keep it\\nunder your skirts like that, who’s to help tumbling? Here! Take the\\nbaby, Mum, and give me your book.”\\n\\nMrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a\\nlittle in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had\\nlasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders\\nthat they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made\\nthe second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the\\nlittle Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.\\n\\nUnder these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the\\nchildren into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket\\ncame out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to\\nfind that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression\\nof face, and with his very grey hair disordered on his head, as if he\\ndidn’t quite see his way to putting anything straight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXIII.\\n\\n\\nMr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to\\nsee him. “For, I really am not,” he added, with his son’s smile, “an\\nalarming personage.” He was a young-looking man, in spite of his\\nperplexities and his very grey hair, and his manner seemed quite\\nnatural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;\\nthere was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would\\nhave been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was\\nvery near being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to\\nMrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which\\nwere black and handsome, “Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?”\\nAnd she looked up from her book, and said, “Yes.” She then smiled upon\\nme in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of\\norange-flower water? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on\\nany foregone or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been\\nthrown out, like her previous approaches, in general conversational\\ncondescension.\\n\\nI found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.\\nPocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased\\nKnight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased\\nfather would have been made a Baronet but for somebody’s determined\\nopposition arising out of entirely personal motives,—I forget whose, if\\nI ever knew,—the Sovereign’s, the Prime Minister’s, the Lord\\nChancellor’s, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s, anybody’s,—and had tacked\\nhimself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite\\nsupposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for\\nstorming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate\\naddress engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first\\nstone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage\\neither the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed\\nMrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature\\nof things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the\\nacquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.\\n\\nSo successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady\\nby this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but\\nperfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,\\nin the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was\\nalso in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to\\nmount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing\\nthe one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket\\nhad taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it\\nwould seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the\\nknowledge of the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing\\nto bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that\\ndower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket\\nthat his wife was “a treasure for a Prince.” Mr. Pocket had invested\\nthe Prince’s treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was\\nsupposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs.\\nPocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity,\\nbecause she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of\\na queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.\\n\\nMr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a\\npleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for\\nmy own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other\\nsimilar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle\\nand Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of\\narchitecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,\\nwas reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of\\nexploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.\\n\\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody\\nelse’s hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house\\nand let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the\\nservants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of\\nsaving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the\\nservants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their\\neating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They\\nallowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always\\nappeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded\\nin would have been the kitchen,—always supposing the boarder capable of\\nself-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighbouring lady\\nwith whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that\\nshe had seen Millers slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs.\\nPocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said that it\\nwas an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldn’t mind their own\\nbusiness.\\n\\nBy degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been\\neducated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished\\nhimself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket\\nvery early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the\\ncalling of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,—of whom\\nit was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always\\ngoing to help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the\\nblades had left the Grindstone,—he had wearied of that poor work and\\nhad come to London. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he\\nhad “read” with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them,\\nand had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned\\nhis acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,\\nand on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still\\nmaintained the house I saw.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbour; a widow lady of that highly\\nsympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,\\nand shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances.\\nThis lady’s name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honour of taking her\\ndown to dinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand\\non the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr.\\nPocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read\\nwith him. That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and\\nconfidence (at that time, I had known her something less than five\\nminutes); if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.\\n\\n“But dear Mrs. Pocket,” said Mrs. Coiler, “after her early\\ndisappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that),\\nrequires so much luxury and elegance—”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am,” I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to\\ncry.\\n\\n“And she is of so aristocratic a disposition—”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am,” I said again, with the same object as before.\\n\\n“—That it _is_ hard,” said Mrs. Coiler, “to have dear Mr. Pocket’s time\\nand attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.”\\n\\nI could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher’s time\\nand attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,\\nand indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company\\nmanners.\\n\\nIt came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and\\nDrummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and\\nother instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian\\nname was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It\\nfurther appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the\\ngarden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which\\nher grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at\\nall. Drummle didn’t say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a\\nsulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognised Mrs.\\nPocket as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler\\nthe toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the\\nconversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but\\nit promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the\\nannouncement of a domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook\\nhad mislaid the beef. To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first\\ntime, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance\\nthat struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on\\nanybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He\\nlaid down the carving-knife and fork,—being engaged in carving, at the\\nmoment,—put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make\\nan extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done\\nthis, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with\\nwhat he was about.\\n\\nMrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked\\nit for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the\\npleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at me\\nwhen she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and\\nlocalities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and\\nwhen she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little\\nto her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for\\nbeing on the opposite side of the table.\\n\\nAfter dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made\\nadmiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,—a sagacious way of\\nimproving their minds. There were four little girls, and two little\\nboys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby’s next\\nsuccessor who was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and\\nMillers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been\\nrecruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs.\\nPocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she\\nrather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but\\ndidn’t quite know what to make of them.\\n\\n“Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,” said Flopson. “Don’t\\ntake it that way, or you’ll get its head under the table.”\\n\\nThus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head upon\\nthe table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious\\nconcussion.\\n\\n“Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,” said Flopson; “and Miss Jane, come\\nand dance to baby, do!”\\n\\nOne of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely\\ntaken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place\\nby me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and\\nlaughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the\\nmeantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,\\nand we all laughed and were glad.\\n\\nFlopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,\\nthen got it safely into Mrs. Pocket’s lap, and gave it the nut-crackers\\nto play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice\\nthat the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its\\neyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the\\ntwo nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase\\nwith a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly\\nlost half his buttons at the gaming-table.\\n\\nI was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket’s falling into a\\ndiscussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a\\nsliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the\\nbaby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers.\\nAt length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled,\\nsoftly left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the\\ndangerous weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the\\nsame time, and not approving of this, said to Jane,—\\n\\n“You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!”\\n\\n“Mamma dear,” lisped the little girl, “baby ood have put hith eyeth\\nout.”\\n\\n“How dare you tell me so?” retorted Mrs. Pocket. “Go and sit down in\\nyour chair this moment!”\\n\\nMrs. Pocket’s dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if\\nI myself had done something to rouse it.\\n\\n“Belinda,” remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,\\n“how can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the\\nprotection of baby.”\\n\\n“I will not allow anybody to interfere,” said Mrs. Pocket. “I am\\nsurprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of\\ninterference.”\\n\\n“Good God!” cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.\\n“Are infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to\\nsave them?”\\n\\n“I will not be interfered with by Jane,” said Mrs. Pocket, with a\\nmajestic glance at that innocent little offender. “I hope I know my\\npoor grandpapa’s position. Jane, indeed!”\\n\\nMr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did\\nlift himself some inches out of his chair. “Hear this!” he helplessly\\nexclaimed to the elements. “Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for\\npeople’s poor grandpapa’s positions!” Then he let himself down again,\\nand became silent.\\n\\nWe all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A\\npause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a\\nseries of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the\\nonly member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had\\nany decided acquaintance.\\n\\n“Mr. Drummle,” said Mrs. Pocket, “will you ring for Flopson? Jane, you\\nundutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with\\nma!”\\n\\nThe baby was the soul of honour, and protested with all its might. It\\ndoubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket’s arm, exhibited a\\npair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its\\nsoft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it\\ngained its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a\\nfew minutes, being nursed by little Jane.\\n\\nIt happened that the other five children were left behind at the\\ndinner-table, through Flopson’s having some private engagement, and\\ntheir not being anybody else’s business. I thus became aware of the\\nmutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in\\nthe following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his\\nface heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes,\\nas if he couldn’t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in\\nthat establishment, and why they hadn’t been billeted by Nature on\\nsomebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain\\nquestions,—as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,\\nFlopson was going to mend it when she had time,—and how little Fanny\\ncame by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it\\nwhen she didn’t forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and\\ngave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as\\nthey went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the\\nhair he dismissed the hopeless subject.\\n\\nIn the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop\\nhad each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I\\nwas pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but\\nas I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,—not to\\nsay for other waters,—I at once engaged to place myself under the\\ntuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to\\nwhom I was introduced by my new allies. This practical authority\\nconfused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he\\ncould have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt\\nif he would have paid it.\\n\\nThere was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we\\nshould all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable\\ndomestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid\\ncame in, and said, “If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.”\\n\\n“Speak to your master?” said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused\\nagain. “How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or\\nspeak to me—at some other time.”\\n\\n“Begging your pardon, ma’am,” returned the housemaid, “I should wish to\\nspeak at once, and to speak to master.”\\n\\nHereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of\\nourselves until he came back.\\n\\n“This is a pretty thing, Belinda!” said Mr. Pocket, returning with a\\ncountenance expressive of grief and despair. “Here’s the cook lying\\ninsensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh\\nbutter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!”\\n\\nMrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, “This is\\nthat odious Sophia’s doing!”\\n\\n“What do you mean, Belinda?” demanded Mr. Pocket.\\n\\n“Sophia has told you,” said Mrs. Pocket. “Did I not see her with my own\\neyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask\\nto speak to you?”\\n\\n“But has she not taken me downstairs, Belinda,” returned Mr. Pocket,\\n“and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?”\\n\\n“And do you defend her, Matthew,” said Mrs. Pocket, “for making\\nmischief?”\\n\\nMr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.\\n\\n“Am I, grandpapa’s granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?” said\\nMrs. Pocket. “Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful\\nwoman, and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after\\nthe situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.”\\n\\nThere was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the\\nattitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude he said, with a\\nhollow voice, “Good night, Mr. Pip,” when I deemed it advisable to go\\nto bed and leave him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXIV.\\n\\n\\nAfter two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and\\nhad gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had\\nordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk\\ntogether. He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he\\nreferred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed\\nfor any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my\\ndestiny if I could “hold my own” with the average of young men in\\nprosperous circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to\\nthe contrary.\\n\\nHe advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition\\nof such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the\\nfunctions of explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that\\nwith intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me,\\nand should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his\\nway of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself\\non confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state\\nat once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his\\ncompact with me, that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling\\nmine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no\\ndoubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no\\nsuch excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever\\nregard him as having anything ludicrous about him—or anything but what\\nwas serious, honest, and good—in his tutor communication with me.\\n\\nWhen these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had\\nbegun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my\\nbedroom in Barnard’s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my\\nmanners would be none the worse for Herbert’s society. Mr. Pocket did\\nnot object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could\\npossibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt\\nthat this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would\\nsave Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted\\nmy wish to Mr. Jaggers.\\n\\n“If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,” said I, “and one or\\ntwo other little things, I should be quite at home there.”\\n\\n“Go it!” said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. “I told you you’d get\\non. Well! How much do you want?”\\n\\nI said I didn’t know how much.\\n\\n“Come!” retorted Mr. Jaggers. “How much? Fifty pounds?”\\n\\n“O, not nearly so much.”\\n\\n“Five pounds?” said Mr. Jaggers.\\n\\nThis was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, “O, more than\\nthat.”\\n\\n“More than that, eh!” retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with\\nhis hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the\\nwall behind me; “how much more?”\\n\\n“It is so difficult to fix a sum,” said I, hesitating.\\n\\n“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers. “Let’s get at it. Twice five; will that do?\\nThree times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?”\\n\\nI said I thought that would do handsomely.\\n\\n“Four times five will do handsomely, will it?” said Mr. Jaggers,\\nknitting his brows. “Now, what do you make of four times five?”\\n\\n“What do I make of it?”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Mr. Jaggers; “how much?”\\n\\n“I suppose you make it twenty pounds,” said I, smiling.\\n\\n“Never mind what _I_ make it, my friend,” observed Mr. Jaggers, with a\\nknowing and contradictory toss of his head. “I want to know what _you_\\nmake it.”\\n\\n“Twenty pounds, of course.”\\n\\n“Wemmick!” said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door. “Take Mr. Pip’s\\nwritten order, and pay him twenty pounds.”\\n\\nThis strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked\\nimpression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers never\\nlaughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising\\nhimself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows\\njoined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to\\ncreak, as if _they_ laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happened\\nto go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to\\nWemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers’s manner.\\n\\n“Tell him that, and he’ll take it as a compliment,” answered Wemmick;\\n“he don’t mean that you _should_ know what to make of it.—Oh!” for I\\nlooked surprised, “it’s not personal; it’s professional: only\\nprofessional.”\\n\\nWemmick was at his desk, lunching—and crunching—on a dry hard biscuit;\\npieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as\\nif he were posting them.\\n\\n“Always seems to me,” said Wemmick, “as if he had set a man-trap and\\nwas watching it. Suddenly—click—you’re caught!”\\n\\nWithout remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life,\\nI said I supposed he was very skilful?\\n\\n“Deep,” said Wemmick, “as Australia.” Pointing with his pen at the\\noffice floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the\\npurposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the\\nglobe. “If there was anything deeper,” added Wemmick, bringing his pen\\nto paper, “he’d be it.”\\n\\nThen, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said,\\n“Ca-pi-tal!” Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he\\nreplied,—\\n\\n“We don’t run much into clerks, because there’s only one Jaggers, and\\npeople won’t have him at second hand. There are only four of us. Would\\nyou like to see ’em? You are one of us, as I may say.”\\n\\nI accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the\\npost, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key of\\nwhich safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his\\ncoat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was dark\\nand shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.\\nJaggers’s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase\\nfor years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something\\nbetween a publican and a rat-catcher—a large pale, puffed, swollen\\nman—was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby\\nappearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to\\nbe treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers’s coffers. “Getting evidence\\ntogether,” said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, “for the Bailey.” In the\\nroom over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair\\n(his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was\\nsimilarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented\\nto me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt\\nme anything I pleased,—and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,\\nas if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a\\nhigh-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was\\ndressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been\\nwaxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of\\nthe other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers’s own use.\\n\\nThis was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmick\\nled me into my guardian’s room, and said, “This you’ve seen already.”\\n\\n“Pray,” said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them\\ncaught my sight again, “whose likenesses are those?”\\n\\n“These?” said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off\\nthe horrible heads before bringing them down. “These are two celebrated\\nones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap\\n(why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the\\ninkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered\\nhis master, and, considering that he wasn’t brought up to evidence,\\ndidn’t plan it badly.”\\n\\n“Is it like him?” I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat\\nupon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.\\n\\n“Like him? It’s himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,\\ndirectly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for me,\\nhadn’t you, Old Artful?” said Wemmick. He then explained this\\naffectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady\\nand the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,\\n“Had it made for me, express!”\\n\\n“Is the lady anybody?” said I.\\n\\n“No,” returned Wemmick. “Only his game. (You liked your bit of game,\\ndidn’t you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except\\none,—and she wasn’t of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn’t\\nhave caught _her_ looking after this urn, unless there was something to\\ndrink in it.” Wemmick’s attention being thus directed to his brooch, he\\nput down the cast, and polished the brooch with his\\npocket-handkerchief.\\n\\n“Did that other creature come to the same end?” I asked. “He has the\\nsame look.”\\n\\n“You’re right,” said Wemmick; “it’s the genuine look. Much as if one\\nnostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes, he\\ncame to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. He\\nforged wills, this blade did, if he didn’t also put the supposed\\ntestators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though” (Mr.\\nWemmick was again apostrophising), “and you said you could write Greek.\\nYah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!”\\nBefore putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the\\nlargest of his mourning rings and said, “Sent out to buy it for me,\\nonly the day before.”\\n\\nWhile he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,\\nthe thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived\\nfrom like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I\\nventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood\\nbefore me, dusting his hands.\\n\\n“O yes,” he returned, “these are all gifts of that kind. One brings\\nanother, you see; that’s the way of it. I always take ’em. They’re\\ncuriosities. And they’re property. They may not be worth much, but,\\nafter all, they’re property and portable. It don’t signify to you with\\nyour brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,\\n‘Get hold of portable property’.”\\n\\nWhen I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a\\nfriendly manner:—\\n\\n“If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn’t\\nmind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I\\nshould consider it an honour. I have not much to show you; but such two\\nor three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and I\\nam fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.”\\n\\nI said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.\\n\\n“Thankee,” said he; “then we’ll consider that it’s to come off, when\\nconvenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?”\\n\\n“Not yet.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Wemmick, “he’ll give you wine, and good wine. I’ll give\\nyou punch, and not bad punch. And now I’ll tell you something. When you\\ngo to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.”\\n\\n“Shall I see something very uncommon?”\\n\\n“Well,” said Wemmick, “you’ll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very\\nuncommon, you’ll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original\\nwildness of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won’t lower your\\nopinion of Mr. Jaggers’s powers. Keep your eye on it.”\\n\\nI told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his\\npreparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I\\nwould like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers “at it?”\\n\\nFor several reasons, and not least because I didn’t clearly know what\\nMr. Jaggers would be found to be “at,” I replied in the affirmative. We\\ndived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where a\\nblood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased, with the\\nfanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably\\nchewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or\\ncross-examination,—I don’t know which,—and was striking her, and the\\nbench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever\\ndegree, said a word that he didn’t approve of, he instantly required to\\nhave it “taken down.” If anybody wouldn’t make an admission, he said,\\n“I’ll have it out of you!” and if anybody made an admission, he said,\\n“Now I have got you!” The magistrates shivered under a single bite of\\nhis finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his\\nwords, and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their\\ndirection. Which side he was on I couldn’t make out, for he seemed to\\nme to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I\\nstole out on tiptoe, he was not on the side of the bench; for, he was\\nmaking the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive\\nunder the table, by his denunciations of his conduct as the\\nrepresentative of British law and justice in that chair that day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXV.\\n\\n\\nBentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book\\nas if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an\\nacquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement, and\\ncomprehension,—in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in the\\nlarge, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he\\nhimself lolled about in a room,—he was idle, proud, niggardly,\\nreserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,\\nwho had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the\\ndiscovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley\\nDrummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that\\ngentleman, and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.\\n\\nStartop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought\\nto have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and\\nadmired her beyond measure. He had a woman’s delicacy of feature, and\\nwas—“as you may see, though you never saw her,” said Herbert to\\nme—“exactly like his mother.” It was but natural that I should take to\\nhim much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest\\nevenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one\\nanother, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up in\\nour wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He\\nwould always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious\\ncreature, even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and\\nI always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the\\nback-water, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the\\nmoonlight in mid-stream.\\n\\nHerbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him with a\\nhalf-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down\\nto Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often\\ntook me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all\\nhours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so\\npleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of\\nuntried youth and hope.\\n\\nWhen I had been in Mr. Pocket’s family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.\\nCamilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket’s sister. Georgiana, whom I\\nhad seen at Miss Havisham’s on the same occasion, also turned up. She\\nwas a cousin,—an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity\\nreligion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of\\ncupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon me\\nin my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as a\\ngrown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the\\ncomplacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they held\\nin contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily\\ndisappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon\\nthemselves.\\n\\nThese were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied\\nmyself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began\\nto spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should\\nhave thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my\\nbooks. There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to\\nfeel my deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast;\\nand, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I\\nwanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as\\ngreat a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.\\n\\nI had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write\\nhim a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening. He\\nreplied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect\\nme at the office at six o’clock. Thither I went, and there I found him,\\nputting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.\\n\\n“Did you think of walking down to Walworth?” said he.\\n\\n“Certainly,” said I, “if you approve.”\\n\\n“Very much,” was Wemmick’s reply, “for I have had my legs under the\\ndesk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I’ll tell you\\nwhat I have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,—which\\nis of home preparation,—and a cold roast fowl,—which is from the\\ncook’s-shop. I think it’s tender, because the master of the shop was a\\nJuryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.\\nI reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, “Pick us out a\\ngood one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box\\nanother day or two, we could easily have done it.” He said to that,\\n“Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.” I let him, of\\ncourse. As far as it goes, it’s property and portable. You don’t object\\nto an aged parent, I hope?”\\n\\nI really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,\\n“Because I have got an aged parent at my place.” I then said what\\npoliteness required.\\n\\n“So, you haven’t dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?” he pursued, as we walked\\nalong.\\n\\n“Not yet.”\\n\\n“He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expect\\nyou’ll have an invitation to-morrow. He’s going to ask your pals, too.\\nThree of ’em; ain’t there?”\\n\\nAlthough I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my\\nintimate associates, I answered, “Yes.”\\n\\n“Well, he’s going to ask the whole gang,”—I hardly felt complimented by\\nthe word,—“and whatever he gives you, he’ll give you good. Don’t look\\nforward to variety, but you’ll have excellence. And there’s another rum\\nthing in his house,” proceeded Wemmick, after a moment’s pause, as if\\nthe remark followed on the housekeeper understood; “he never lets a\\ndoor or window be fastened at night.”\\n\\n“Is he never robbed?”\\n\\n“That’s it!” returned Wemmick. “He says, and gives it out publicly, “I\\nwant to see the man who’ll rob _me_.” Lord bless you, I have heard him,\\na hundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in\\nour front office, “You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn\\nthere; why don’t you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can’t I\\ntempt you?” Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on,\\nfor love or money.”\\n\\n“They dread him so much?” said I.\\n\\n“Dread him,” said Wemmick. “I believe you they dread him. Not but what\\nhe’s artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia\\nmetal, every spoon.”\\n\\n“So they wouldn’t have much,” I observed, “even if they—”\\n\\n“Ah! But _he_ would have much,” said Wemmick, cutting me short, “and\\nthey know it. He’d have their lives, and the lives of scores of ’em.\\nHe’d have all he could get. And it’s impossible to say what he couldn’t\\nget, if he gave his mind to it.”\\n\\nI was falling into meditation on my guardian’s greatness, when Wemmick\\nremarked:—\\n\\n“As to the absence of plate, that’s only his natural depth, you know. A\\nriver’s its natural depth, and he’s his natural depth. Look at his\\nwatch-chain. That’s real enough.”\\n\\n“It’s very massive,” said I.\\n\\n“Massive?” repeated Wemmick. “I think so. And his watch is a gold\\nrepeater, and worth a hundred pound if it’s worth a penny. Mr. Pip,\\nthere are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about\\nthat watch; there’s not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who\\nwouldn’t identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it\\nwas red hot, if inveigled into touching it.”\\n\\nAt first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a\\nmore general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the\\nroad, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the\\ndistrict of Walworth.\\n\\nIt appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little\\ngardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.\\nWemmick’s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of\\ngarden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery\\nmounted with guns.\\n\\n“My own doing,” said Wemmick. “Looks pretty; don’t it?”\\n\\nI highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw;\\nwith the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them\\nsham), and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.\\n\\n“That’s a real flagstaff, you see,” said Wemmick, “and on Sundays I run\\nup a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I\\nhoist it up—so—and cut off the communication.”\\n\\nThe bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and\\ntwo deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he\\nhoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and\\nnot merely mechanically.\\n\\n“At nine o’clock every night, Greenwich time,” said Wemmick, “the gun\\nfires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you’ll\\nsay he’s a Stinger.”\\n\\nThe piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,\\nconstructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an\\ningenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.\\n\\n“Then, at the back,” said Wemmick, “out of sight, so as not to impede\\nthe idea of fortifications,—for it’s a principle with me, if you have\\nan idea, carry it out and keep it up,—I don’t know whether that’s your\\nopinion—”\\n\\nI said, decidedly.\\n\\n“—At the back, there’s a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I\\nknock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and\\nyou’ll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,” said\\nWemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, “if\\nyou can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of\\na time in point of provisions.”\\n\\nThen, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was\\napproached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long\\ntime to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.\\nOur punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower\\nwas raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which\\nmight have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he\\nhad constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill\\ngoing and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent\\nthat it made the back of your hand quite wet.\\n\\n“I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my\\nown gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,” said Wemmick, in\\nacknowledging my compliments. “Well; it’s a good thing, you know. It\\nbrushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn’t\\nmind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn’t put\\nyou out?”\\n\\nI expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There we\\nfound, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean,\\ncheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.\\n\\n“Well aged parent,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial\\nand jocose way, “how am you?”\\n\\n“All right, John; all right!” replied the old man.\\n\\n“Here’s Mr. Pip, aged parent,” said Wemmick, “and I wish you could hear\\nhis name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that’s what he likes. Nod away at\\nhim, if you please, like winking!”\\n\\n“This is a fine place of my son’s, sir,” cried the old man, while I\\nnodded as hard as I possibly could. “This is a pretty pleasure-ground,\\nsir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept\\ntogether by the Nation, after my son’s time, for the people’s\\nenjoyment.”\\n\\n“You’re as proud of it as Punch; ain’t you, Aged?” said Wemmick,\\ncontemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened;\\n“_there’s_ a nod for you;” giving him a tremendous one; “_there’s_\\nanother for you;” giving him a still more tremendous one; “you like\\nthat, don’t you? If you’re not tired, Mr. Pip—though I know it’s tiring\\nto strangers—will you tip him one more? You can’t think how it pleases\\nhim.”\\n\\nI tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him\\nbestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in\\nthe arbour; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it had\\ntaken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present\\npitch of perfection.\\n\\n“Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?”\\n\\n“O yes,” said Wemmick, “I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It’s a\\nfreehold, by George!”\\n\\n“Is it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?”\\n\\n“Never seen it,” said Wemmick. “Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged.\\nNever heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is\\nanother. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and\\nwhen I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it’s not\\nin any way disagreeable to you, you’ll oblige me by doing the same. I\\ndon’t wish it professionally spoken about.”\\n\\nOf course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his\\nrequest. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and\\ntalking, until it was almost nine o’clock. “Getting near gun-fire,”\\nsaid Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; “it’s the Aged’s treat.”\\n\\nProceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,\\nwith expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great\\nnightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the\\nmoment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and\\nrepair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the\\nStinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a\\ncottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup\\nin it ring. Upon this, the Aged—who I believe would have been blown out\\nof his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows—cried out exultingly,\\n“He’s fired! I heerd him!” and I nodded at the old gentleman until it\\nis no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.\\n\\nThe interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me\\nhis collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious\\ncharacter; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been\\ncommitted, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and\\nseveral manuscript confessions written under condemnation,—upon which\\nMr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, “every\\none of ’em Lies, sir.” These were agreeably dispersed among small\\nspecimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the\\nproprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.\\nThey were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had\\nbeen first inducted, and which served, not only as the general\\nsitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan\\non the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the\\nsuspension of a roasting-jack.\\n\\nThere was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged\\nin the day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered\\nto give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper\\nwas excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot\\ninsomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have\\nbeen farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment.\\nNor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there\\nbeing such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when\\nI lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that\\npole on my forehead all night.\\n\\nWemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him\\ncleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from\\nmy gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in a\\nmost devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at\\nhalf-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,\\nWemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened\\ninto a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business\\nand he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as\\nunconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the\\ndrawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged,\\nhad all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the\\nStinger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXVI.\\n\\n\\nIt fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early\\nopportunity of comparing my guardian’s establishment with that of his\\ncashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with\\nhis scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he\\ncalled me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends\\nwhich Wemmick had prepared me to receive. “No ceremony,” he stipulated,\\n“and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.” I asked him where we should\\ncome to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his\\ngeneral objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,\\n“Come here, and I’ll take you home with me.” I embrace this opportunity\\nof remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or\\na dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose,\\nwhich smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer’s shop. It had an\\nunusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would\\nwash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,\\nwhenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his\\nroom. When I and my friends repaired to him at six o’clock next day, he\\nseemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than\\nusual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only\\nwashing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And\\neven when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,\\nhe took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before\\nhe put his coat on.\\n\\nThere were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into\\nthe street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was\\nsomething so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his\\npresence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along\\nwestward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of\\nthe streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he\\nnever otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybody\\nrecognised him.\\n\\nHe conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side\\nof that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in\\nwant of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and\\nopened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and\\nlittle used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark\\nbrown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the\\npanelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know\\nwhat kind of loops I thought they looked like.\\n\\nDinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his\\ndressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the\\nwhole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was\\ncomfortably laid—no silver in the service, of course—and at the side of\\nhis chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and\\ndecanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed\\nthroughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed\\neverything himself.\\n\\nThere was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,\\nthat they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,\\ntrials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very\\nsolid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,\\nand there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a\\nlittle table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring\\nthe office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an\\nevening and fall to work.\\n\\nAs he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,—for he and I had\\nwalked together,—he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,\\nand took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to\\nbe principally if not solely interested in Drummle.\\n\\n“Pip,” said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to\\nthe window, “I don’t know one from the other. Who’s the Spider?”\\n\\n“The spider?” said I.\\n\\n“The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.”\\n\\n“That’s Bentley Drummle,” I replied; “the one with the delicate face is\\nStartop.”\\n\\nNot making the least account of “the one with the delicate face,” he\\nreturned, “Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that\\nfellow.”\\n\\nHe immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his\\nreplying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to\\nscrew discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came\\nbetween me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.\\n\\nShe was a woman of about forty, I supposed,—but I may have thought her\\nyounger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely\\npale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot\\nsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be\\nparted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious\\nexpression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see\\nMacbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked\\nto me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had\\nseen rise out of the Witches’ caldron.\\n\\nShe set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a\\nfinger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats\\nat the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,\\nwhile Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the\\nhousekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice\\nmutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all\\nthe accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our\\nhost from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the\\ntable, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean\\nplates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just\\ndisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant\\nthan the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw\\nin her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made\\na dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other\\nnatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass\\nbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.\\n\\nInduced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own\\nstriking appearance and by Wemmick’s preparation, I observed that\\nwhenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my\\nguardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put\\nbefore him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and\\nwanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I\\nfancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and\\na purpose of always holding her in suspense.\\n\\nDinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather\\nthan originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of\\nour dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing\\nmy tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to\\nboast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my\\nlips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the\\ndevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious\\nway at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.\\n\\nIt was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our\\nconversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied\\nfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.\\nDrummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to\\nour company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that\\nas to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible\\nagency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity\\nabout this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show\\nhow muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in\\na ridiculous manner.\\n\\nNow the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,\\ntaking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,\\nwas leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and\\nshowing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.\\nSuddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper’s, like a trap,\\nas she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do\\nthis, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.\\n\\n“If you talk of strength,” said Mr. Jaggers, “_I_’ll show you a wrist.\\nMolly, let them see your wrist.”\\n\\nHer entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other\\nhand behind her waist. “Master,” she said, in a low voice, with her\\neyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. “Don’t.”\\n\\n“_I_’ll show you a wrist,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable\\ndetermination to show it. “Molly, let them see your wrist.”\\n\\n“Master,” she again murmured. “Please!”\\n\\n“Molly,” said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking\\nat the opposite side of the room, “let them see _both_ your wrists.\\nShow them. Come!”\\n\\nHe took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She\\nbrought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by\\nside. The last wrist was much disfigured,—deeply scarred and scarred\\nacross and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from\\nMr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us\\nin succession.\\n\\n“There’s power here,” said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews\\nwith his forefinger. “Very few men have the power of wrist that this\\nwoman has. It’s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these\\nhands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw\\nstronger in that respect, man’s or woman’s, than these.”\\n\\nWhile he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued\\nto look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment\\nhe ceased, she looked at him again. “That’ll do, Molly,” said Mr.\\nJaggers, giving her a slight nod; “you have been admired, and can go.”\\nShe withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,\\nputting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and\\npassed round the wine.\\n\\n“At half-past nine, gentlemen,” said he, “we must break up. Pray make\\nthe best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I\\ndrink to you.”\\n\\nIf his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,\\nit perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose\\ndepreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,\\nuntil he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.\\nJaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed\\nto serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers’s wine.\\n\\nIn our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,\\nand I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some\\nboorish sneer of Drummle’s, to the effect that we were too free with\\nour money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that\\nit came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my\\npresence but a week or so before.\\n\\n“Well,” retorted Drummle; “he’ll be paid.”\\n\\n“I don’t mean to imply that he won’t,” said I, “but it might make you\\nhold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.”\\n\\n“_You_ should think!” retorted Drummle. “Oh Lord!”\\n\\n“I dare say,” I went on, meaning to be very severe, “that you wouldn’t\\nlend money to any of us if we wanted it.”\\n\\n“You are right,” said Drummle. “I wouldn’t lend one of you a sixpence.\\nI wouldn’t lend anybody a sixpence.”\\n\\n“Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.”\\n\\n“_You_ should say,” repeated Drummle. “Oh Lord!”\\n\\nThis was so very aggravating—the more especially as I found myself\\nmaking no way against his surly obtuseness—that I said, disregarding\\nHerbert’s efforts to check me,—\\n\\n“Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I’ll tell you what\\npassed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.”\\n\\n“_I_ don’t want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,”\\ngrowled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might\\nboth go to the devil and shake ourselves.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you, however,” said I, “whether you want to know or not. We\\nsaid that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed\\nto be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.”\\n\\nDrummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands\\nin his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that\\nit was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.\\n\\nHereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than\\nI had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,\\nbeing a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact\\nopposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct\\npersonal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop\\ntried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made\\nus all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything,\\nDrummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his\\npockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and\\nwould have flung it at his adversary’s head, but for our entertainer’s\\ndexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that\\npurpose.\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and\\nhauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, “I am exceedingly\\nsorry to announce that it’s half past nine.”\\n\\nOn this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,\\nStartop was cheerily calling Drummle “old boy,” as if nothing had\\nhappened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not\\neven walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,\\nwho remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;\\nStartop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the\\nhouses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.\\n\\nAs the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for\\na moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found\\nhim in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard\\nat it, washing his hands of us.\\n\\nI told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything\\ndisagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame\\nme much.\\n\\n“Pooh!” said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the\\nwater-drops; “it’s nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.”\\n\\nHe had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing,\\nand towelling himself.\\n\\n“I am glad you like him, sir,” said I—“but I don’t.”\\n\\n“No, no,” my guardian assented; “don’t have too much to do with him.\\nKeep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one\\nof the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller—”\\n\\nLooking out of the towel, he caught my eye.\\n\\n“But I am not a fortune-teller,” he said, letting his head drop into a\\nfestoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. “You know what I\\nam, don’t you? Good night, Pip.”\\n\\n“Good night, sir.”\\n\\nIn about a month after that, the Spider’s time with Mr. Pocket was up\\nfor good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, he\\nwent home to the family hole.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXVII.\\n\\n\\n“MY DEAR MR PIP:—\\n\\n“I write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he is\\ngoing to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if\\nagreeable to be allowed to see you. He would call at Barnard’s Hotel\\nTuesday morning at nine o’clock, when if not agreeable please leave\\nword. Your poor sister is much the same as when you left. We talk of\\nyou in the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying and\\ndoing. If now considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the\\nlove of poor old days. No more, dear Mr. Pip, from\\n\\n“Your ever obliged, and affectionate servant,\\n“BIDDY.”\\n\\n\\n“P.S. He wishes me most particular to write _what larks_. He says you\\nwill understand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see\\nhim, even though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he is\\na worthy, worthy man. I have read him all, excepting only the last\\nlittle sentence, and he wishes me most particular to write again _what\\nlarks_.”\\n\\nI received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its\\nappointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings\\nI looked forward to Joe’s coming.\\n\\nNot with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no; with\\nconsiderable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of\\nincongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly\\nwould have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he was coming\\nto Barnard’s Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall\\nin Bentley Drummle’s way. I had little objection to his being seen by\\nHerbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the\\nsharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in\\ncontempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are\\nusually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\\n\\nI had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite\\nunnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those\\nwrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were vastly\\ndifferent from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honour of\\noccupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighbouring\\nupholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a\\nboy in boots,—top boots,—in bondage and slavery to whom I might have\\nbeen said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of\\nthe refuse of my washerwoman’s family), and had clothed him with a blue\\ncoat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots\\nalready mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to\\neat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my\\nexistence.\\n\\nThis avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday\\nmorning in the hall, (it was two feet square, as charged for\\nfloorcloth,) and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he\\nthought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being\\nso interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of\\nsuspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see _him_, he\\nwouldn’t have been quite so brisk about it.\\n\\nHowever, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and\\nI got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and\\nbreakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately\\nthe morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact\\nthat Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some\\nweak giant of a Sweep.\\n\\nAs the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger\\npursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on the\\nstaircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming\\nupstairs,—his state boots being always too big for him,—and by the time\\nit took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his\\nascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear his\\nfinger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards\\ndistinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave a\\nfaint single rap, and Pepper—such was the compromising name of the\\navenging boy—announced “Mr. Gargery!” I thought he never would have\\ndone wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off the\\nmat, but at last he came in.\\n\\n“Joe, how are you, Joe?”\\n\\n“Pip, how AIR you, Pip?”\\n\\nWith his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put down\\non the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked them\\nstraight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.\\n\\n“I am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.”\\n\\nBut Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird’s-nest\\nwith eggs in it, wouldn’t hear of parting with that piece of property,\\nand persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.\\n\\n“Which you have that growed,” said Joe, “and that swelled, and that\\ngentle-folked;” Joe considered a little before he discovered this word;\\n“as to be sure you are a honour to your king and country.”\\n\\n“And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.”\\n\\n“Thank God,” said Joe, “I’m ekerval to most. And your sister, she’s no\\nworse than she were. And Biddy, she’s ever right and ready. And all\\nfriends is no backerder, if not no forarder. ’Ceptin Wopsle; he’s had a\\ndrop.”\\n\\nAll this time (still with both hands taking great care of the\\nbird’s-nest), Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and\\nround and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.\\n\\n“Had a drop, Joe?”\\n\\n“Why yes,” said Joe, lowering his voice, “he’s left the Church and went\\ninto the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him to\\nLondon along with me. And his wish were,” said Joe, getting the\\nbird’s-nest under his left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an\\negg with his right; “if no offence, as I would ’and you that.”\\n\\nI took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of a\\nsmall metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that\\nvery week, of “the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown,\\nwhose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National\\nBard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic\\ncircles.”\\n\\n“Were you at his performance, Joe?” I inquired.\\n\\n“I _were_,” said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.\\n\\n“Was there a great sensation?”\\n\\n“Why,” said Joe, “yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.\\nPartickler when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir,\\nwhether it were calc’lated to keep a man up to his work with a good\\nhart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with\\n“Amen!” A man may have had a misfortun’ and been in the Church,” said\\nJoe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, “but that\\nis no reason why you should put him out at such a time. Which I\\nmeantersay, if the ghost of a man’s own father cannot be allowed to\\nclaim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his mourning ’at\\nis unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers\\nbrings it off, try to keep it on how you may.”\\n\\nA ghost-seeing effect in Joe’s own countenance informed me that Herbert\\nhad entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his\\nhand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird’s-nest.\\n\\n“Your servant, Sir,” said Joe, “which I hope as you and Pip”—here his\\neye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so\\nplainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the\\nfamily, that I frowned it down and confused him more—“I meantersay, you\\ntwo gentlemen,—which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?\\nFor the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,”\\nsaid Joe, confidentially, “and I believe its character do stand it; but\\nI wouldn’t keep a pig in it myself,—not in the case that I wished him\\nto fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on him.”\\n\\nHaving borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our\\ndwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me\\n“sir,” Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the\\nroom for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,—as if it were\\nonly on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a\\nresting place,—and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the\\nchimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.\\n\\n“Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?” asked Herbert, who always\\npresided of a morning.\\n\\n“Thankee, Sir,” said Joe, stiff from head to foot, “I’ll take whichever\\nis most agreeable to yourself.”\\n\\n“What do you say to coffee?”\\n\\n“Thankee, Sir,” returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,\\n“since you _are_ so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run\\ncontrairy to your own opinions. But don’t you never find it a little\\n’eating?”\\n\\n“Say tea then,” said Herbert, pouring it out.\\n\\nHere Joe’s hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of his\\nchair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it\\nwere an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again\\nsoon.\\n\\n“When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?”\\n\\n“Were it yesterday afternoon?” said Joe, after coughing behind his\\nhand, as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came.\\n“No it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon” (with\\nan appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).\\n\\n“Have you seen anything of London yet?”\\n\\n“Why, yes, Sir,” said Joe, “me and Wopsle went off straight to look at\\nthe Blacking Ware’us. But we didn’t find that it come up to its\\nlikeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,” added\\nJoe, in an explanatory manner, “as it is there drawd too\\narchitectooralooral.”\\n\\nI really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily\\nexpressive to my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect\\nChorus, but for his attention being providentially attracted by his\\nhat, which was toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a constant\\nattention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by\\nwicket-keeping. He made extraordinary play with it, and showed the\\ngreatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as it\\ndropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humouring\\nit in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern\\nof the paper on the wall, before he felt it safe to close with it;\\nfinally splashing it into the slop-basin, where I took the liberty of\\nlaying hands upon it.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAs to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing to\\nreflect upon,—insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself\\nto that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Why\\nshould he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his\\nholiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of\\nmeditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had\\nhis eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such\\nremarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much more\\nthan he ate, and pretended that he hadn’t dropped it; that I was\\nheartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.\\n\\nI had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was\\nall my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have\\nbeen easier with me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper with\\nhim; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.\\n\\n“Us two being now alone, sir,”—began Joe.\\n\\n“Joe,” I interrupted, pettishly, “how can you call me, sir?”\\n\\nJoe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like\\nreproach. Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collars\\nwere, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.\\n\\n“Us two being now alone,” resumed Joe, “and me having the intentions\\nand abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now\\nconclude—leastways begin—to mention what have led to my having had the\\npresent honour. For was it not,” said Joe, with his old air of lucid\\nexposition, “that my only wish were to be useful to you, I should not\\nhave had the honour of breaking wittles in the company and abode of\\ngentlemen.”\\n\\nI was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance\\nagainst this tone.\\n\\n“Well, sir,” pursued Joe, “this is how it were. I were at the Bargemen\\nt’other night, Pip;”—whenever he subsided into affection, he called me\\nPip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir; “when\\nthere come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook. Which that same\\nidentical,” said Joe, going down a new track, “do comb my ’air the\\nwrong way sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were\\nhim which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a\\nplayfellow by yourself.”\\n\\n“Nonsense. It was you, Joe.”\\n\\n“Which I fully believed it were, Pip,” said Joe, slightly tossing his\\nhead, “though it signify little now, sir. Well, Pip; this same\\nidentical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at the\\nBargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the\\nworkingman, sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were,\\n‘Joseph, Miss Havisham she wish to speak to you.’”\\n\\n“Miss Havisham, Joe?”\\n\\n“‘She wish,’ were Pumblechook’s word, ‘to speak to you.’” Joe sat and\\nrolled his eyes at the ceiling.\\n\\n“Yes, Joe? Go on, please.”\\n\\n“Next day, sir,” said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off,\\n“having cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.”\\n\\n“Miss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?”\\n\\n“Which I say, sir,” replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if\\nhe were making his will, “Miss A., or otherways Havisham. Her\\nexpression air then as follering: ‘Mr. Gargery. You air in\\ncorrespondence with Mr. Pip?’ Having had a letter from you, I were able\\nto say ‘I am.’ (When I married your sister, sir, I said ‘I will;’ and\\nwhen I answered your friend, Pip, I said ‘I am.’) ‘Would you tell him,\\nthen,’ said she, ‘that which Estella has come home and would be glad to\\nsee him.’”\\n\\nI felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause of\\nits firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his\\nerrand, I should have given him more encouragement.\\n\\n“Biddy,” pursued Joe, “when I got home and asked her fur to write the\\nmessage to you, a little hung back. Biddy says, ‘I know he will be very\\nglad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to see\\nhim, go!’ I have now concluded, sir,” said Joe, rising from his chair,\\n“and, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a\\ngreater height.”\\n\\n“But you are not going now, Joe?”\\n\\n“Yes I am,” said Joe.\\n\\n“But you are coming back to dinner, Joe?”\\n\\n“No I am not,” said Joe.\\n\\nOur eyes met, and all the “Sir” melted out of that manly heart as he\\ngave me his hand.\\n\\n“Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded\\ntogether, as I may say, and one man’s a blacksmith, and one’s a\\nwhitesmith, and one’s a goldsmith, and one’s a coppersmith. Diwisions\\namong such must come, and must be met as they come. If there’s been any\\nfault at all to-day, it’s mine. You and me is not two figures to be\\ntogether in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and\\nbeknown, and understood among friends. It ain’t that I am proud, but\\nthat I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these\\nclothes. I’m wrong in these clothes. I’m wrong out of the forge, the\\nkitchen, or off th’ meshes. You won’t find half so much fault in me if\\nyou think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even\\nmy pipe. You won’t find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you\\nshould ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge\\nwindow and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old\\nburnt apron, sticking to the old work. I’m awful dull, but I hope I’ve\\nbeat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GOD bless\\nyou, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!”\\n\\nI had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in\\nhim. The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he\\nspoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven. He touched\\nme gently on the forehead, and went out. As soon as I could recover\\nmyself sufficiently, I hurried out after him and looked for him in the\\nneighbouring streets; but he was gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXVIII.\\n\\n\\nIt was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first\\nflow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe’s.\\nBut, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow’s coach, and had been\\ndown to Mr. Pocket’s and back, I was not by any means convinced on the\\nlast point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up\\nat the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joe’s; I was not\\nexpected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from Miss\\nHavisham’s, and she was exacting and mightn’t like it. All other\\nswindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such\\npretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should\\ninnocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else’s manufacture is\\nreasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin\\nof my own make as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of\\ncompactly folding up my bank-notes for security’s sake, abstracts the\\nnotes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine,\\nwhen I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!\\n\\nHaving settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much\\ndisturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It was\\ntempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots\\nin the archway of the Blue Boar’s posting-yard; it was almost solemn to\\nimagine him casually produced in the tailor’s shop, and confounding the\\ndisrespectful senses of Trabb’s boy. On the other hand, Trabb’s boy\\nmight worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless\\nand desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High\\nStreet. My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve. On the\\nwhole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.\\n\\nIt was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as\\nwinter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until\\ntwo or three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys\\nwas two o’clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to\\nspare, attended by the Avenger,—if I may connect that expression with\\none who never attended on me if he could possibly help it.\\n\\nAt that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards\\nby stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside\\npassengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling\\ntheir ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised\\nwhen Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were\\ntwo convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old\\nreason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word\\n“convict.”\\n\\n“You don’t mind them, Handel?” said Herbert.\\n\\n“O no!”\\n\\n“I thought you seemed as if you didn’t like them?”\\n\\n“I can’t pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don’t\\nparticularly. But I don’t mind them.”\\n\\n“See! There they are,” said Herbert, “coming out of the Tap. What a\\ndegraded and vile sight it is!”\\n\\nThey had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler\\nwith them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.\\nThe two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their\\nlegs,—irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I\\nlikewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a\\nthick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good\\nunderstanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at\\nthe putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts\\nwere an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he\\nthe Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and\\nappeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the\\nworld, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller\\nsuit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those\\nshapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his\\nhalf-closed eye at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on\\nthe settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had\\nbrought me down with his invisible gun!\\n\\nIt was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had\\nnever seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye\\nappraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said\\nsomething to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves\\nround with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something\\nelse. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors;\\ntheir coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower\\nanimals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with\\npocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them\\nand kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable\\nand degraded spectacle.\\n\\nBut this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the\\nback of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and\\nthat there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in\\nfront behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had\\ntaken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion,\\nand said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such\\nvillainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and\\ninfamous, and shameful, and I don’t know what else. At this time the\\ncoach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing\\nto get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,—bringing\\nwith them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and\\nhearthstone, which attends the convict presence.\\n\\n“Don’t take it so much amiss, sir,” pleaded the keeper to the angry\\npassenger; “I’ll sit next you myself. I’ll put ’em on the outside of\\nthe row. They won’t interfere with you, sir. You needn’t know they’re\\nthere.”\\n\\n“And don’t blame _me_,” growled the convict I had recognised. “_I_\\ndon’t want to go. _I_ am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am\\nconcerned any one’s welcome to _my_ place.”\\n\\n“Or mine,” said the other, gruffly. “_I_ wouldn’t have incommoded none\\nof you, if I’d had _my_ way.” Then they both laughed, and began\\ncracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.—As I really think I\\nshould have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so\\ndespised.\\n\\nAt length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,\\nand that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So\\nhe got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into\\nthe place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as\\nthey could, and the convict I had recognised sat behind me with his\\nbreath on the hair of my head.\\n\\n“Good-bye, Handel!” Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a\\nblessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.\\n\\nIt is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict’s\\nbreathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The\\nsensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and\\nsearching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more\\nbreathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in\\ndoing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side,\\nin my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.\\n\\nThe weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us\\nall lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way\\nHouse behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed\\noff, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a\\ncouple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,\\nand how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I\\nwere going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the\\nquestion up again.\\n\\nBut I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I\\ncould recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and\\nshadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that\\nblew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against\\nthe wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first\\nwords I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of\\nmy own thought, “Two One Pound notes.”\\n\\n“How did he get ’em?” said the convict I had never seen.\\n\\n“How should I know?” returned the other. “He had ’em stowed away\\nsomehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.”\\n\\n“I wish,” said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, “that I\\nhad ’em here.”\\n\\n“Two one pound notes, or friends?”\\n\\n“Two one pound notes. I’d sell all the friends I ever had for one, and\\nthink it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says—?”\\n\\n“So he says,” resumed the convict I had recognised,—“it was all said\\nand done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the\\nDock-yard,—‘You’re a-going to be discharged?’ Yes, I was. Would I find\\nout that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two\\none pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.”\\n\\n“More fool you,” growled the other. “I’d have spent ’em on a Man, in\\nwittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed\\nnothing of you?”\\n\\n“Not a ha’porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried\\nagain for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.”\\n\\n“And was that—Honour!—the only time you worked out, in this part of the\\ncountry?”\\n\\n“The only time.”\\n\\n“What might have been your opinion of the place?”\\n\\n“A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,\\nmist, and mudbank.”\\n\\nThey both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually\\ngrowled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.\\n\\nAfter overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and\\nbeen left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling\\ncertain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not\\nonly so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and\\nso differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could\\nhave known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our\\nbeing together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a\\ndread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in\\nhis hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as\\nsoon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This\\ndevice I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot\\nunder my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down\\nbefore me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the\\nfirst stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their\\nway with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off\\nto the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting\\nfor them at the slime-washed stairs,—again heard the gruff “Give way,\\nyou!” like and order to dogs,—again saw the wicked Noah’s Ark lying out\\non the black water.\\n\\nI could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether\\nundefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on\\nto the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension\\nof a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am\\nconfident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the\\nrevival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.\\n\\nThe coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered\\nmy dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As\\nsoon as he had apologised for the remissness of his memory, he asked me\\nif he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?\\n\\n“No,” said I, “certainly not.”\\n\\nThe waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from\\nthe Commercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, and\\ntook the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local\\nnewspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this\\nparagraph:—\\n\\nOur readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference\\nto the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of\\nthis neighbourhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our\\nas yet not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our\\ncolumns!) that the youth’s earliest patron, companion, and friend, was\\na highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn\\nand seed trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business\\npremises are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street. It is\\nnot wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as\\nthe Mentor of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our\\ntown produced the founder of the latter’s fortunes. Does the\\nthought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local\\nBeauty inquire whose fortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the\\nBLACKSMITH of Antwerp. VERB. SAP.\\n\\nI entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the\\ndays of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met\\nsomebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have\\ntold me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my\\nfortunes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXIX.\\n\\n\\nBetimes in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to go to\\nMiss Havisham’s, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham’s side\\nof town,—which was not Joe’s side; I could go there to-morrow,—thinking\\nabout my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for\\nme.\\n\\nShe had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could\\nnot fail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it for\\nme to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark\\nrooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down\\nthe cobwebs, destroy the vermin,—in short, do all the shining deeds of\\nthe young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to\\nlook at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked\\nwindows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with\\nits twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich\\nattractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the\\ninspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had\\ntaken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so\\nset upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had\\nbeen all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her\\nwith any attributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this\\nplace, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clue by which I am to be\\nfollowed into my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the\\nconventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified\\ntruth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her\\nsimply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my\\nsorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against\\nreason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against\\nhappiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I\\nloved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence\\nin restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human\\nperfection.\\n\\nI so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When I\\nhad rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the\\ngate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart\\nmoderately quiet. I heard the side-door open, and steps come across the\\ncourtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its\\nrusty hinges.\\n\\nBeing at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started\\nmuch more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober\\ngrey dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of\\nporter at Miss Havisham’s door.\\n\\n“Orlick!”\\n\\n“Ah, young master, there’s more changes than yours. But come in, come\\nin. It’s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.”\\n\\nI entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. “Yes!”\\nsaid he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards\\nthe house. “Here I am!”\\n\\n“How did you come here?”\\n\\n“I come here,” he retorted, “on my legs. I had my box brought alongside\\nme in a barrow.”\\n\\n“Are you here for good?”\\n\\n“I ain’t here for harm, young master, I suppose?”\\n\\nI was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my\\nmind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up my\\nlegs and arms, to my face.\\n\\n“Then you have left the forge?” I said.\\n\\n“Do this look like a forge?” replied Orlick, sending his glance all\\nround him with an air of injury. “Now, do it look like it?”\\n\\nI asked him how long he had left Gargery’s forge?\\n\\n“One day is so like another here,” he replied, “that I don’t know\\nwithout casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left.”\\n\\n“I could have told you that, Orlick.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said he, dryly. “But then you’ve got to be a scholar.”\\n\\nBy this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be one\\njust within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the\\ncourtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of\\nplace usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were\\nhanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his\\npatchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess. The\\nwhole had a slovenly, confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a\\nhuman dormouse; while he, looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a\\ncorner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for whom it was\\nfitted up,—as indeed he was.\\n\\n“I never saw this room before,” I remarked; “but there used to be no\\nPorter here.”\\n\\n“No,” said he; “not till it got about that there was no protection on\\nthe premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and\\nTag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended\\nto the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought,\\nand I took it. It’s easier than bellowsing and hammering.—That’s\\nloaded, that is.”\\n\\nMy eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the\\nchimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine.\\n\\n“Well,” said I, not desirous of more conversation, “shall I go up to\\nMiss Havisham?”\\n\\n“Burn me, if I know!” he retorted, first stretching himself and then\\nshaking himself; “my orders ends here, young master. I give this here\\nbell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till\\nyou meet somebody.”\\n\\n“I am expected, I believe?”\\n\\n“Burn me twice over, if I can say!” said he.\\n\\nUpon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in\\nmy thick boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of the passage,\\nwhile the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who\\nappeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason\\nof me.\\n\\n“Oh!” said she. “You, is it, Mr. Pip?”\\n\\n“It is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family\\nare all well.”\\n\\n“Are they any wiser?” said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head;\\n“they had better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know\\nyour way, sir?”\\n\\nTolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I\\nascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old\\nway at the door of Miss Havisham’s room. “Pip’s rap,” I heard her say,\\nimmediately; “come in, Pip.”\\n\\nShe was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two\\nhands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on\\nthe fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been\\nworn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an\\nelegant lady whom I had never seen.\\n\\n“Come in, Pip,” Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking\\nround or up; “come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as\\nif I were a queen, eh?—Well?”\\n\\nShe looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a\\ngrimly playful manner,—\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“I heard, Miss Havisham,” said I, rather at a loss, “that you were so\\nkind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\nThe lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked\\narchly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella’s eyes. But she\\nwas so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,\\nin all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance, that\\nI seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that I\\nslipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O the\\nsense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the\\ninaccessibility that came about her!\\n\\nShe gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt\\nin seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a\\nlong, long time.\\n\\n“Do you find her much changed, Pip?” asked Miss Havisham, with her\\ngreedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between\\nthem, as a sign to me to sit down there.\\n\\n“When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella\\nin the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into\\nthe old—”\\n\\n“What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?” Miss Havisham\\ninterrupted. “She was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away\\nfrom her. Don’t you remember?”\\n\\nI said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better\\nthen, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she\\nhad no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very\\ndisagreeable.\\n\\n“Is _he_ changed?” Miss Havisham asked her.\\n\\n“Very much,” said Estella, looking at me.\\n\\n“Less coarse and common?” said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella’s\\nhair.\\n\\nEstella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,\\nand looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still,\\nbut she lured me on.\\n\\nWe sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so\\nwrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from\\nFrance, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,\\nshe had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that\\nit was impossible and out of nature—or I thought so—to separate them\\nfrom her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence\\nfrom all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had\\ndisturbed my boyhood,—from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had\\nfirst made me ashamed of home and Joe,—from all those visions that had\\nraised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the\\nanvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden\\nwindow of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me\\nto separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life\\nof my life.\\n\\nIt was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and\\nreturn to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had\\nconversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the\\nneglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel\\nher about a little, as in times of yore.\\n\\nSo, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I\\nhad strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;\\nI, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,\\nquite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As\\nwe drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,—\\n\\n“I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight\\nthat day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.”\\n\\n“You rewarded me very much.”\\n\\n“Did I?” she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. “I remember I\\nentertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill\\nthat he should be brought here to pester me with his company.”\\n\\n“He and I are great friends now.”\\n\\n“Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nI made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish\\nlook, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.\\n\\n“Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your\\ncompanions,” said Estella.\\n\\n“Naturally,” said I.\\n\\n“And necessarily,” she added, in a haughty tone; “what was fit company\\nfor you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.”\\n\\nIn my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering\\nintention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put\\nit to flight.\\n\\n“You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?” said\\nEstella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting\\ntimes.\\n\\n“Not the least.”\\n\\nThe air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my\\nside, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at\\nhers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me\\nmore than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being\\nso set apart for her and assigned to her.\\n\\nThe garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and\\nafter we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again\\ninto the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her\\nwalking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and\\ncareless look in that direction, “Did I?” I reminded her where she had\\ncome out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, “I\\ndon’t remember.” “Not remember that you made me cry?” said I. “No,”\\nsaid she, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe\\nthat her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry\\nagain, inwardly,—and that is the sharpest crying of all.\\n\\n“You must know,” said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and\\nbeautiful woman might, “that I have no heart,—if that has anything to\\ndo with my memory.”\\n\\nI got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of\\ndoubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty\\nwithout it.\\n\\n“Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,” said\\nEstella, “and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. But\\nyou know what I mean. I have no softness there,\\nno—sympathy—sentiment—nonsense.”\\n\\nWhat _was_ it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and\\nlooked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?\\nNo. In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of\\nresemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been\\nacquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been much\\nassociated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will\\nproduce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces\\nthat are otherwise quite different. And yet I could not trace this to\\nMiss Havisham. I looked again, and though she was still looking at me,\\nthe suggestion was gone.\\n\\nWhat _was_ it?\\n\\n“I am serious,” said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow\\nwas smooth) as with a darkening of her face; “if we are to be thrown\\nmuch together, you had better believe it at once. No!” imperiously\\nstopping me as I opened my lips. “I have not bestowed my tenderness\\nanywhere. I have never had any such thing.”\\n\\nIn another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she\\npointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same\\nfirst day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to\\nhave seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand,\\nagain the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed\\nme. My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm.\\nInstantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.\\n\\nWhat _was_ it?\\n\\n“What is the matter?” asked Estella. “Are you scared again?”\\n\\n“I should be, if I believed what you said just now,” I replied, to turn\\nit off.\\n\\n“Then you don’t? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will\\nsoon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be\\nlaid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round\\nof the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my\\ncruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.”\\n\\nHer handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand\\nnow, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We\\nwalked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in\\nbloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of\\nthe old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it\\ncould not have been more cherished in my remembrance.\\n\\nThere was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;\\nwe were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more\\nin her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her\\nbeauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my\\ndelight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness\\nhad chosen us for one another. Wretched boy!\\n\\nAt last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,\\nthat my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and\\nwould come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in\\nthe room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while\\nwe were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.\\n\\nIt was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began\\nthe old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But, in\\nthe funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the\\nchair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and\\nbeautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.\\n\\nThe time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,\\nand Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre\\nof the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms\\nstretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow\\ncloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the\\ndoor, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity\\nthat was of its kind quite dreadful.\\n\\nThen, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and\\nsaid in a whisper,—\\n\\n“Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?”\\n\\n“Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.”\\n\\nShe drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as\\nshe sat in the chair. “Love her, love her, love her! How does she use\\nyou?”\\n\\nBefore I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question\\nat all) she repeated, “Love her, love her, love her! If she favours\\nyou, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to\\npieces,—and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,—love\\nher, love her, love her!”\\n\\nNever had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her\\nutterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm\\nround my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.\\n\\n“Hear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,\\nto be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.\\nLove her!”\\n\\nShe said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she\\nmeant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead\\nof love—despair—revenge—dire death—it could not have sounded from her\\nlips more like a curse.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you,” said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper,\\n“what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning\\nself-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself\\nand against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the\\nsmiter—as I did!”\\n\\nWhen she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught\\nher round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a\\ndress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck\\nherself against the wall and fallen dead.\\n\\nAll this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I\\nwas conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in\\nthe room.\\n\\nHe always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a\\npocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was\\nof great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a\\nclient or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief\\nas if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing, as\\nif he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or\\nwitness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed\\ndirectly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he\\nhad this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking\\nat us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent\\npause in that attitude, “Indeed? Singular!” and then put the\\nhandkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.\\n\\nMiss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody else)\\nafraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and\\nstammered that he was as punctual as ever.\\n\\n“As punctual as ever,” he repeated, coming up to us. “(How do you do,\\nPip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you\\nare here, Pip?”\\n\\nI told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to\\ncome and see Estella. To which he replied, “Ah! Very fine young lady!”\\nThen he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his\\nlarge hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket\\nwere full of secrets.\\n\\n“Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?” said he, when\\nhe came to a stop.\\n\\n“How often?”\\n\\n“Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?”\\n\\n“Oh! Certainly not so many.”\\n\\n“Twice?”\\n\\n“Jaggers,” interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, “leave my Pip\\nalone, and go with him to your dinner.”\\n\\nHe complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While\\nwe were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved\\nyard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat\\nand drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred\\ntimes and once.\\n\\nI considered, and said, “Never.”\\n\\n“And never will, Pip,” he retorted, with a frowning smile. “She has\\nnever allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this\\npresent life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays\\nhands on such food as she takes.”\\n\\n“Pray, sir,” said I, “may I ask you a question?”\\n\\n“You may,” said he, “and I may decline to answer it. Put your\\nquestion.”\\n\\n“Estella’s name. Is it Havisham or—?” I had nothing to add.\\n\\n“Or what?” said he.\\n\\n“Is it Havisham?”\\n\\n“It is Havisham.”\\n\\nThis brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited\\nus. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my green\\nand yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a\\nmaid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but\\nwho, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole\\ntime. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my\\nguardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the\\ntwo ladies left us.\\n\\nAnything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that\\nroof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to\\nhimself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella’s face once during\\ndinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,\\nbut never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often\\nlooked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his\\nface never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a\\ndry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often\\nreferring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,\\nhe showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he\\nextorted—and even did extort, though I don’t know how—those references\\nout of my innocent self.\\n\\nAnd when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him\\nof general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that\\nreally was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he had\\nnothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted\\nthe port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glass\\nagain, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and\\ncross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had\\nknown the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or\\nfour times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he\\nsaw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his\\nhand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to\\ntake notice that it was of no use, for he couldn’t answer.\\n\\nI think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in\\nthe danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her\\ncap,—which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,—and\\nstrewing the ground with her hair,—which assuredly had never grown on\\n_her_ head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss\\nHavisham’s room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss\\nHavisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels\\nfrom her dressing-table into Estella’s hair, and about her bosom and\\narms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick\\neyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,\\nwith those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nOf the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and\\ncame out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the\\nglory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor,\\nof the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in\\nthe light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out\\nlong ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his\\ncold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I\\ncould never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never\\nbear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear\\nto see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be\\nwithin a foot or two of him,—it was, that my feelings should be in the\\nsame place with him,—_that_, was the agonizing circumstance.\\n\\nWe played until nine o’clock, and then it was arranged that when\\nEstella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should\\nmeet her at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her\\nand left her.\\n\\nMy guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the\\nnight, Miss Havisham’s words, “Love her, love her, love her!” sounded\\nin my ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my\\npillow, “I love her, I love her, I love her!” hundreds of times. Then,\\na burst of gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me,\\nonce the blacksmith’s boy. Then I thought if she were, as I feared, by\\nno means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she\\nbegin to be interested in me? When should I awaken the heart within her\\nthat was mute and sleeping now?\\n\\nAh me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never\\nthought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe,\\nbecause I knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone,\\nand Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God\\nforgive me! soon dried.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXX.\\n\\n\\nAfter well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar\\nin the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick’s\\nbeing the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham’s.\\n“Why of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip,” said my guardian,\\ncomfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, “because the man\\nwho fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.” It seemed\\nquite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not\\nexceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a\\nsatisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. “Very\\ngood, Pip,” he observed, when I had concluded, “I’ll go round\\npresently, and pay our friend off.” Rather alarmed by this summary\\naction, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend\\nhimself might be difficult to deal with. “Oh no he won’t,” said my\\nguardian, making his pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect\\nconfidence; “I should like to see him argue the question with _me_.”\\n\\nAs we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I\\nbreakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely\\nhold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a\\nwalk, and that I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers\\nwas occupied, if he would let the coachman know that I would get into\\nmy place when overtaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar\\nimmediately after breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of\\nmiles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook’s premises, I\\ngot round into the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and\\nfelt myself in comparative security.\\n\\nIt was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was\\nnot disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and stared\\nafter. One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops\\nand went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn,\\nas if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,—on which\\noccasions I don’t know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they\\nof not doing it, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a\\ndistinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until\\nFate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb’s boy.\\n\\nCasting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I\\nbeheld Trabb’s boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.\\nDeeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best\\nbeseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced\\nwith that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating\\nmyself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb’s boy smote\\ntogether, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently in\\nevery limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,\\n“Hold me! I’m so frightened!” feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and\\ncontrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed\\nhim, his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of\\nextreme humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.\\n\\nThis was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced\\nanother two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,\\nand indignation, I again beheld Trabb’s boy approaching. He was coming\\nround a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest\\nindustry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb’s with\\ncheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became\\naware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his\\nmotion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees\\nmore afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His\\nsufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,\\nand I felt utterly confounded.\\n\\nI had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when\\nI again beheld Trabb’s boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he\\nwas entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my\\ngreat-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the\\nopposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young\\nfriends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his\\nhand, “Don’t know yah!” Words cannot state the amount of aggravation\\nand injury wreaked upon me by Trabb’s boy, when passing abreast of me,\\nhe pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm\\nakimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body,\\nand drawling to his attendants, “Don’t know yah, don’t know yah, ’pon\\nmy soul don’t know yah!” The disgrace attendant on his immediately\\nafterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with\\ncrows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was\\na blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and\\nwas, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nBut unless I had taken the life of Trabb’s boy on that occasion, I\\nreally do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To have\\nstruggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower\\nrecompense from him than his heart’s best blood, would have been futile\\nand degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; an\\ninvulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew\\nout again between his captor’s legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote,\\nhowever, to Mr. Trabb by next day’s post, to say that Mr. Pip must\\ndecline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed\\nto the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited\\nLoathing in every respectable mind.\\n\\nThe coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my\\nbox-seat again, and arrived in London safe,—but not sound, for my heart\\nwas gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel\\nof oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone myself), and then\\nwent on to Barnard’s Inn.\\n\\nI found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.\\nHaving despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to\\nthe dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my\\nfriend and chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger\\nin the hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an\\nantechamber to the keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A better proof of\\nthe severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be\\nafforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to\\nfind him employment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to\\nHyde Park corner to see what o’clock it was.\\n\\nDinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to\\nHerbert, “My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell\\nyou.”\\n\\n“My dear Handel,” he returned, “I shall esteem and respect your\\nconfidence.”\\n\\n“It concerns myself, Herbert,” said I, “and one other person.”\\n\\nHerbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side,\\nand having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I\\ndidn’t go on.\\n\\n“Herbert,” said I, laying my hand upon his knee, “I love—I\\nadore—Estella.”\\n\\nInstead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy\\nmatter-of-course way, “Exactly. Well?”\\n\\n“Well, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?”\\n\\n“What next, I mean?” said Herbert. “Of course I know _that_.”\\n\\n“How do you know it?” said I.\\n\\n“How do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.”\\n\\n“I never told you.”\\n\\n“Told me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I\\nhave had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her, ever since\\nI have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here\\ntogether. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you\\ntold me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her\\nthe first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.”\\n\\n“Very well, then,” said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome\\nlight, “I have never left off adoring her. And she has come back, a\\nmost beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. And\\nif I adored her before, I now doubly adore her.”\\n\\n“Lucky for you then, Handel,” said Herbert, “that you are picked out\\nfor her and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden ground,\\nwe may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of\\nthat fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella’s views on the adoration\\nquestion?”\\n\\nI shook my head gloomily. “Oh! She is thousands of miles away, from\\nme,” said I.\\n\\n“Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you have\\nsomething more to say?”\\n\\n“I am ashamed to say it,” I returned, “and yet it’s no worse to say it\\nthan to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a\\nblacksmith’s boy but yesterday; I am—what shall I say I am—to-day?”\\n\\n“Say a good fellow, if you want a phrase,” returned Herbert, smiling,\\nand clapping his hand on the back of mine—“a good fellow, with\\nimpetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and\\ndreaming, curiously mixed in him.”\\n\\nI stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this\\nmixture in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognised the\\nanalysis, but thought it not worth disputing.\\n\\n“When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,” I went on, “I\\nsuggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have\\ndone nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised\\nme; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella—”\\n\\n(“And when don’t you, you know?” Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the\\nfire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)\\n\\n“—Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain\\nI feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden\\nground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of\\none person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at the\\nbest, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what\\nthey are!” In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been\\nthere, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.\\n\\n“Now, Handel,” Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, “it seems to\\nme that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into\\nour gift-horse’s mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems to\\nme that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether\\noverlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn’t you tell me that\\nyour guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were\\nnot endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told you\\nso,—though that is a very large If, I grant,—could you believe that of\\nall men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations\\ntowards you unless he were sure of his ground?”\\n\\nI said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (people\\noften do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth\\nand justice;—as if I wanted to deny it!\\n\\n“I should think it _was_ a strong point,” said Herbert, “and I should\\nthink you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you\\nmust bide your guardian’s time, and he must bide his client’s time.\\nYou’ll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then\\nperhaps you’ll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you’ll be\\nnearer getting it, for it must come at last.”\\n\\n“What a hopeful disposition you have!” said I, gratefully admiring his\\ncheery ways.\\n\\n“I ought to have,” said Herbert, “for I have not much else. I must\\nacknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is\\nnot my own, but my father’s. The only remark I ever heard him make on\\nyour story, was the final one, “The thing is settled and done, or Mr.\\nJaggers would not be in it.” And now before I say anything more about\\nmy father, or my father’s son, and repay confidence with confidence, I\\nwant to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a\\nmoment,—positively repulsive.”\\n\\n“You won’t succeed,” said I.\\n\\n“O yes I shall!” said he. “One, two, three, and now I am in for it.\\nHandel, my good fellow;”—though he spoke in this light tone, he was\\nvery much in earnest,—“I have been thinking since we have been talking\\nwith our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition\\nof your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. Am\\nI right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never\\nreferred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,\\nfor instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage\\nultimately?”\\n\\n“Never.”\\n\\n“Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes, upon my\\nsoul and honour! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself\\nfrom her?—I told you I should be disagreeable.”\\n\\nI turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old\\nmarsh winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had\\nsubdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were\\nsolemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post,\\nsmote upon my heart again. There was silence between us for a little\\nwhile.\\n\\n“Yes; but my dear Handel,” Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,\\ninstead of silent, “its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of\\na boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very\\nserious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of\\nwhat she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may\\nlead to miserable things.”\\n\\n“I know it, Herbert,” said I, with my head still turned away, “but I\\ncan’t help it.”\\n\\n“You can’t detach yourself?”\\n\\n“No. Impossible!”\\n\\n“You can’t try, Handel?”\\n\\n“No. Impossible!”\\n\\n“Well!” said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had been\\nasleep, and stirring the fire, “now I’ll endeavour to make myself\\nagreeable again!”\\n\\nSo he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs in\\ntheir places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,\\nlooked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and\\ncame back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left\\nleg in both arms.\\n\\n“I was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and my\\nfather’s son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father’s son\\nto remark that my father’s establishment is not particularly brilliant\\nin its housekeeping.”\\n\\n“There is always plenty, Herbert,” said I, to say something\\nencouraging.\\n\\n“O yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest\\napproval, and so does the marine-store shop in the back street.\\nGravely, Handel, for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is as\\nwell as I do. I suppose there was a time once when my father had not\\ngiven matters up; but if ever there was, the time is gone. May I ask\\nyou if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down in your part\\nof the country, that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are\\nalways most particularly anxious to be married?”\\n\\nThis was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, “Is it\\nso?”\\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Herbert, “that’s what I want to know. Because it\\nis decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was next\\nme and died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. Little\\nJane is the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, you\\nmight suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual\\ncontemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already\\nmade arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew.\\nAnd indeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby.”\\n\\n“Then you are?” said I.\\n\\n“I am,” said Herbert; “but it’s a secret.”\\n\\nI assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favoured with\\nfurther particulars. He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my\\nweakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.\\n\\n“May I ask the name?” I said.\\n\\n“Name of Clara,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“Live in London?”\\n\\n“Yes, perhaps I ought to mention,” said Herbert, who had become\\ncuriously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting\\ntheme, “that she is rather below my mother’s nonsensical family\\nnotions. Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships.\\nI think he was a species of purser.”\\n\\n“What is he now?” said I.\\n\\n“He’s an invalid now,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“Living on—?”\\n\\n“On the first floor,” said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant,\\nfor I had intended my question to apply to his means. “I have never\\nseen him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known\\nClara. But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous\\nrows,—roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.” In\\nlooking at me and then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time\\nrecovered his usual lively manner.\\n\\n“Don’t you expect to see him?” said I.\\n\\n“O yes, I constantly expect to see him,” returned Herbert, “because I\\nnever hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the\\nceiling. But I don’t know how long the rafters may hold.”\\n\\nWhen he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told\\nme that the moment he began to realise Capital, it was his intention to\\nmarry this young lady. He added as a self-evident proposition,\\nengendering low spirits, “But you _can’t_ marry, you know, while you’re\\nlooking about you.”\\n\\nAs we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision\\nto realise this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my\\npockets. A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my\\nattention, I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received\\nfrom Joe, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian\\nrenown. “And bless my heart,” I involuntarily added aloud, “it’s\\nto-night!”\\n\\nThis changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve\\nto go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet\\nHerbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable\\nmeans, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me\\nby reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had\\nwarmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our\\ncandles, made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest\\nof Mr. Wopsle and Denmark.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXXI.\\n\\n\\nOn our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country\\nelevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The\\nwhole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble\\nboy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer\\nwith a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in\\nlife, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of\\nwhite silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My\\ngifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could\\nhave wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable.\\n\\nSeveral curious little circumstances transpired as the action\\nproceeded. The late king of the country not only appeared to have been\\ntroubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it\\nwith him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom\\nalso carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had\\nthe appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of\\nanxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were\\nsuggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led\\nto the Shade’s being advised by the gallery to “turn over!”—a\\nrecommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted\\nof this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of\\nhaving been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it\\nperceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its\\nterrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom\\nlady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public\\nto have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem\\nby a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her\\nwaist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so\\nthat she was openly mentioned as “the kettle-drum.” The noble boy in\\nthe ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were\\nin one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a\\nclergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court\\nfencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice\\ndiscrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a\\nwant of toleration for him, and even—on his being detected in holy\\norders, and declining to perform the funeral service—to the general\\nindignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such\\nslow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off\\nher white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who\\nhad been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the\\nfront row of the gallery, growled, “Now the baby’s put to bed let’s\\nhave supper!” Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.\\n\\nUpon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with\\nplayful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or\\nstate a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on\\nthe question whether ’twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared\\nyes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said “Toss up for\\nit;” and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such\\nfellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged\\nwith loud cries of “Hear, hear!” When he appeared with his stocking\\ndisordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very\\nneat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat\\niron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness\\nof his leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had\\ngiven him. On his taking the recorders,—very like a little black flute\\nthat had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the\\ndoor,—he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he\\nrecommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said,\\n“And don’t _you_ do it, neither; you’re a deal worse than _him_!” And I\\ngrieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of\\nthese occasions.\\n\\nBut his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the\\nappearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical\\nwash-house on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in\\na comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,\\nthe gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, “Look out! Here’s the\\nundertaker a coming, to see how you’re a getting on with your work!” I\\nbelieve it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle\\ncould not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,\\nwithout dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;\\nbut even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without\\nthe comment, “Wai-ter!” The arrival of the body for interment (in an\\nempty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a\\ngeneral joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the\\nbearers, of an individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended\\nMr. Wopsle through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the\\norchestra and the grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the\\nking off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles\\nupward.\\n\\nWe had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle;\\nbut they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,\\nfeeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I\\nlaughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;\\nand yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly\\nfine in Mr. Wopsle’s elocution,—not for old associations’ sake, I am\\nafraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and\\ndownhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural\\ncircumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.\\nWhen the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I\\nsaid to Herbert, “Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him.”\\n\\nWe made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough\\neither. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy\\nsmear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we\\ncame up with him,—\\n\\n“Mr. Pip and friend?”\\n\\nIdentity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.\\n\\n“Mr. Waldengarver,” said the man, “would be glad to have the honour.”\\n\\n“Waldengarver?” I repeated—when Herbert murmured in my ear, “Probably\\nWopsle.”\\n\\n“Oh!” said I. “Yes. Shall we follow you?”\\n\\n“A few steps, please.” When we were in a side alley, he turned and\\nasked, “How did you think he looked?—I dressed him.”\\n\\nI don’t know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the\\naddition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue\\nribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some\\nextraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.\\n\\n“When he come to the grave,” said our conductor, “he showed his cloak\\nbeautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he see\\nthe ghost in the queen’s apartment, he might have made more of his\\nstockings.”\\n\\nI modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,\\ninto a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle\\nwas divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just\\nroom for us to look at him over one another’s shoulders, by keeping the\\npacking-case door, or lid, wide open.\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Wopsle, “I am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,\\nyou will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in\\nformer times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been\\nacknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to\\nget himself out of his princely sables.\\n\\n“Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver,” said the owner of that\\nproperty, “or you’ll bust ’em. Bust ’em, and you’ll bust\\nfive-and-thirty shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a\\nfiner pair. Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave ’em to me.”\\n\\nWith that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who,\\non the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over\\nbackward with his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.\\n\\nI had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then,\\nMr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,—\\n\\n“Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?”\\n\\nHerbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), “Capitally.” So\\nI said “Capitally.”\\n\\n“How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?” said Mr.\\nWaldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.\\n\\nHerbert said from behind (again poking me), “Massive and concrete.” So\\nI said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon\\nit, “Massive and concrete.”\\n\\n“I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,” said Mr. Waldengarver,\\nwith an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall\\nat the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.\\n\\n“But I’ll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,” said the man who was\\non his knees, “in which you’re out in your reading. Now mind! I don’t\\ncare who says contrairy; I tell you so. You’re out in your reading of\\nHamlet when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed,\\nmade the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to\\nput a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal\\n(which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and\\nwhenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out “I don’t\\nsee no wafers!” And at night his reading was lovely.”\\n\\nMr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say “a faithful\\nDependent—I overlook his folly;” and then said aloud, “My view is a\\nlittle classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve,\\nthey will improve.”\\n\\nHerbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.\\n\\n“Did you observe, gentlemen,” said Mr. Waldengarver, “that there was a\\nman in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the service,—I\\nmean, the representation?”\\n\\nWe basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I\\nadded, “He was drunk, no doubt.”\\n\\n“O dear no, sir,” said Mr. Wopsle, “not drunk. His employer would see\\nto that, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk.”\\n\\n“You know his employer?” said I.\\n\\nMr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both\\nceremonies very slowly. “You must have observed, gentlemen,” said he,\\n“an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance\\nexpressive of low malignity, who went through—I will not say\\nsustained—the rôle (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, King\\nof Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!”\\n\\nWithout distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for\\nMr. Wopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was,\\nthat I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put\\non,—which jostled us out at the doorway,—to ask Herbert what he thought\\nof having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would be kind\\nto do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard’s with us,\\nwrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat until\\ntwo o’clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing his\\nplans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general\\nrecollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end\\nwith crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft\\nand without a chance or hope.\\n\\nMiserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella,\\nand miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that\\nI had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert’s Clara, or play Hamlet to\\nMiss Havisham’s Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing\\ntwenty words of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXXII.\\n\\n\\nOne day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note\\nby the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter;\\nfor, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed,\\nI divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip,\\nor Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:—\\n\\n“I am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the midday coach. I\\nbelieve it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham\\nhas that impression, and I write in obedience to it. She sends you her\\nregard.\\n\\n\\n“Yours, ESTELLA.”\\n\\n\\nIf there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits of\\nclothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be\\ncontent with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew no\\npeace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought me\\neither; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the\\ncoach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the\\nBlue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I still\\nfelt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight\\nlonger than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I\\nhad performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours,\\nwhen Wemmick ran against me.\\n\\n“Halloa, Mr. Pip,” said he; “how do you do? I should hardly have\\nthought this was _your_ beat.”\\n\\nI explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by\\ncoach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.\\n\\n“Both flourishing thankye,” said Wemmick, “and particularly the Aged.\\nHe’s in wonderful feather. He’ll be eighty-two next birthday. I have a\\nnotion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighbourhood shouldn’t\\ncomplain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure.\\nHowever, this is not London talk. Where do you think I am going to?”\\n\\n“To the office?” said I, for he was tending in that direction.\\n\\n“Next thing to it,” returned Wemmick, “I am going to Newgate. We are in\\na banker’s-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road\\ntaking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word\\nor two with our client.”\\n\\n“Did your client commit the robbery?” I asked.\\n\\n“Bless your soul and body, no,” answered Wemmick, very drily. “But he\\nis accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be accused\\nof it, you know.”\\n\\n“Only neither of us is,” I remarked.\\n\\n“Yah!” said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger;\\n“you’re a deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to have a look at Newgate?\\nHave you time to spare?”\\n\\nI had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief,\\nnotwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my\\neye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry\\nwhether I had time to walk with him, I went into the office, and\\nascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the\\ntrying of his temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be\\nexpected,—which I knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I then rejoined\\nMr. Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by\\nthe information I had received, accepted his offer.\\n\\nWe were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge\\nwhere some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison\\nrules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much\\nneglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all\\npublic wrongdoing—and which is always its heaviest and longest\\npunishment—was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better\\nthan soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their\\nprisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their\\nsoup. It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was\\ngoing his rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards,\\nwere buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly,\\ndisorderly, depressing scene it was.\\n\\nIt struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener\\nmight walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his\\nseeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, “What,\\nCaptain Tom? Are _you_ there? Ah, indeed!” and also, “Is that Black\\nBill behind the cistern? Why I didn’t look for you these two months;\\nhow do you find yourself?” Equally in his stopping at the bars and\\nattending to anxious whisperers,—always singly,—Wemmick with his\\npost-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference,\\nas if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made,\\nsince last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.\\n\\nHe was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department\\nof Mr. Jaggers’s business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers\\nhung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His\\npersonal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,\\nand in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both\\nhands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in\\nhis pockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting\\nthe raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible\\nfrom the insufficient money produced, said, “it’s no use, my boy. I’m\\nonly a subordinate. I can’t take it. Don’t go on in that way with a\\nsubordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had\\nbetter address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals\\nin the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one,\\nmay be worth the while of another; that’s my recommendation to you,\\nspeaking as a subordinate. Don’t try on useless measures. Why should\\nyou? Now, who’s next?”\\n\\nThus, we walked through Wemmick’s greenhouse, until he turned to me and\\nsaid, “Notice the man I shall shake hands with.” I should have done so,\\nwithout the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.\\n\\nAlmost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can see\\nnow, as I write) in a well-worn olive-coloured frock-coat, with a\\npeculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that\\nwent wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner of\\nthe bars, and put his hand to his hat—which had a greasy and fatty\\nsurface like cold broth—with a half-serious and half-jocose military\\nsalute.\\n\\n“Colonel, to you!” said Wemmick; “how are you, Colonel?”\\n\\n“All right, Mr. Wemmick.”\\n\\n“Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too\\nstrong for us, Colonel.”\\n\\n“Yes, it was too strong, sir,—but _I_ don’t care.”\\n\\n“No, no,” said Wemmick, coolly, “_you_ don’t care.” Then, turning to\\nme, “Served His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought\\nhis discharge.”\\n\\nI said, “Indeed?” and the man’s eyes looked at me, and then looked over\\nmy head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across\\nhis lips and laughed.\\n\\n“I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,” he said to Wemmick.\\n\\n“Perhaps,” returned my friend, “but there’s no knowing.”\\n\\n“I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,”\\nsaid the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.\\n\\n“Thankye,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. “Same to you,\\nColonel.”\\n\\n“If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,” said the\\nman, unwilling to let his hand go, “I should have asked the favour of\\nyour wearing another ring—in acknowledgment of your attentions.”\\n\\n“I’ll accept the will for the deed,” said Wemmick. “By the by; you were\\nquite a pigeon-fancier.” The man looked up at the sky. “I am told you\\nhad a remarkable breed of tumblers. _Could_ you commission any friend\\nof yours to bring me a pair, if you’ve no further use for ’em?”\\n\\n“It shall be done, sir.”\\n\\n“All right,” said Wemmick, “they shall be taken care of.\\nGood-afternoon, Colonel. Good-bye!” They shook hands again, and as we\\nwalked away Wemmick said to me, “A Coiner, a very good workman. The\\nRecorder’s report is made to-day, and he is sure to be executed on\\nMonday. Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are\\nportable property all the same.” With that, he looked back, and nodded\\nat this dead plant, and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of\\nthe yard, as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its\\nplace.\\n\\nAs we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great\\nimportance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less than\\nby those whom they held in charge. “Well, Mr. Wemmick,” said the\\nturnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,\\nand who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, “what’s Mr.\\nJaggers going to do with that water-side murder? Is he going to make it\\nmanslaughter, or what’s he going to make of it?”\\n\\n“Why don’t you ask him?” returned Wemmick.\\n\\n“O yes, I dare say!” said the turnkey.\\n\\n“Now, that’s the way with them here, Mr. Pip,” remarked Wemmick,\\nturning to me with his post-office elongated. “They don’t mind what\\nthey ask of me, the subordinate; but you’ll never catch ’em asking any\\nquestions of my principal.”\\n\\n“Is this young gentleman one of the ’prentices or articled ones of your\\noffice?” asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick’s humour.\\n\\n“There he goes again, you see!” cried Wemmick, “I told you so! Asks\\nanother question of the subordinate before his first is dry! Well,\\nsupposing Mr. Pip is one of them?”\\n\\n“Why then,” said the turnkey, grinning again, “he knows what Mr.\\nJaggers is.”\\n\\n“Yah!” cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a\\nfacetious way, “you’re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do\\nwith my principal, you know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or I’ll\\nget him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment.”\\n\\nThe turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us\\nover the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the\\nstreet.\\n\\n“Mind you, Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm\\nto be more confidential; “I don’t know that Mr. Jaggers does a better\\nthing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. He’s always so\\nhigh. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities.\\nThat Colonel durst no more take leave of _him_, than that turnkey durst\\nask him his intentions respecting a case. Then, between his height and\\nthem, he slips in his subordinate,—don’t you see?—and so he has ’em,\\nsoul and body.”\\n\\nI was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian’s\\nsubtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the\\nfirst time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.\\n\\nMr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where\\nsuppliants for Mr. Jaggers’s notice were lingering about as usual, and\\nI returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some\\nthree hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange\\nit was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and\\ncrime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter\\nevening, I should have first encountered it; that, it should have\\nreappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded\\nbut not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and\\nadvancement. While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful\\nyoung Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with\\nabsolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her. I wished\\nthat Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone\\nwith him, so that, of all days in the year on this day, I might not\\nhave had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust\\noff my feet as I sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress,\\nand I exhaled its air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel,\\nremembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and\\nI was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick’s\\nconservatory, when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand\\nwaving to me.\\n\\nWhat _was_ the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had\\npassed?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXXIII.\\n\\n\\nIn her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately\\nbeautiful than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was\\nmore winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I\\nthought I saw Miss Havisham’s influence in the change.\\n\\nWe stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and\\nwhen it was all collected I remembered—having forgotten everything but\\nherself in the meanwhile—that I knew nothing of her destination.\\n\\n“I am going to Richmond,” she told me. “Our lesson is, that there are\\ntwo Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the\\nSurrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage,\\nand you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges\\nout of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I,\\nbut to obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own\\ndevices, you and I.”\\n\\nAs she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an inner\\nmeaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with\\ndispleasure.\\n\\n“A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a\\nlittle?”\\n\\n“Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you\\nare to take care of me the while.”\\n\\nShe drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a\\nwaiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen\\nsuch a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,\\nhe pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which he\\ncouldn’t find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the\\nestablishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous\\narticle, considering the hole’s proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,\\nand somebody’s pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us\\ninto another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a\\nscorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked\\nat this extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order;\\nwhich, proving to be merely, “Some tea for the lady,” sent him out of\\nthe room in a very low state of mind.\\n\\nI was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong\\ncombination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that\\nthe coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising\\nproprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.\\nYet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that\\nwith her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all\\nhappy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)\\n\\n“Where are you going to, at Richmond?” I asked Estella.\\n\\n“I am going to live,” said she, “at a great expense, with a lady there,\\nwho has the power—or says she has—of taking me about, and introducing\\nme, and showing people to me and showing me to people.”\\n\\n“I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?”\\n\\n“Yes, I suppose so.”\\n\\nShe answered so carelessly, that I said, “You speak of yourself as if\\nyou were some one else.”\\n\\n“Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,” said Estella,\\nsmiling delightfully, “you must not expect me to go to school to _you_;\\nI must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?”\\n\\n“I live quite pleasantly there; at least—” It appeared to me that I was\\nlosing a chance.\\n\\n“At least?” repeated Estella.\\n\\n“As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.”\\n\\n“You silly boy,” said Estella, quite composedly, “how can you talk such\\nnonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest\\nof his family?”\\n\\n“Very superior indeed. He is nobody’s enemy—”\\n\\n“Don’t add but his own,” interposed Estella, “for I hate that class of\\nman. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and\\nspite, I have heard?”\\n\\n“I am sure I have every reason to say so.”\\n\\n“You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,” said\\nEstella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once\\ngrave and rallying, “for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and\\ninsinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,\\nwrite letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment\\nand the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realise to yourself\\nthe hatred those people feel for you.”\\n\\n“They do me no harm, I hope?”\\n\\nInstead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very\\nsingular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When\\nshe left off—and she had not laughed languidly, but with real\\nenjoyment—I said, in my diffident way with her,—\\n\\n“I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any\\nharm.”\\n\\n“No, no you may be sure of that,” said Estella. “You may be certain\\nthat I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and\\nthe tortures they undergo!” She laughed again, and even now when she\\nhad told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not\\ndoubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion. I\\nthought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw\\nthe thought in my mind, and answered it.\\n\\n“It is not easy for even you.” said Estella, “to know what satisfaction\\nit gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of\\nthe ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not\\nbrought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not\\nyour little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed\\nand defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that\\nis soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round\\nchildish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a\\nwoman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up\\nin the night. I did.”\\n\\nIt was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these\\nremembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of\\nthat look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.\\n\\n“Two things I can tell you,” said Estella. “First, notwithstanding the\\nproverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your\\nmind at rest that these people never will—never would in a hundred\\nyears—impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great\\nor small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so\\nbusy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.”\\n\\nAs she gave it to me playfully,—for her darker mood had been but\\nmomentary—I held it and put it to my lips. “You ridiculous boy,” said\\nEstella, “will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the\\nsame spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?”\\n\\n“What spirit was that?” said I.\\n\\n“I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and\\nplotters.”\\n\\n“If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?”\\n\\n“You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you\\nlike.”\\n\\nI leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue’s. “Now,” said\\nEstella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, “you are to take\\ncare that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.”\\n\\nHer reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us,\\nand we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our\\nintercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,\\nI could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on\\nagainst trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it\\nalways was.\\n\\nI rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue,\\nbrought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of\\ntea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and\\nforks (including carvers), spoons (various), salt-cellars, a meek\\nlittle muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron\\ncover, Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a\\nquantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof\\nimpressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of\\nbread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in\\nwith, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a\\nprolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came\\nback with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I\\nsteeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances\\nextracted one cup of I don’t know what for Estella.\\n\\nThe bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,\\nand the chambermaid taken into consideration,—in a word, the whole\\nhouse bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella’s\\npurse much lightened,—we got into our post-coach and drove away.\\nTurning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon\\nunder the walls of which I was so ashamed.\\n\\n“What place is that?” Estella asked me.\\n\\nI made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it, and then told\\nher. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring,\\n“Wretches!” I would not have confessed to my visit for any\\nconsideration.\\n\\n“Mr. Jaggers,” said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,\\n“has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place\\nthan any man in London.”\\n\\n“He is more in the secrets of every place, I think,” said Estella, in a\\nlow voice.\\n\\n“You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?”\\n\\n“I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since I\\ncan remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could\\nspeak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with\\nhim?”\\n\\n“Once habituated to his distrustful manner,” said I, “I have done very\\nwell.”\\n\\n“Are you intimate?”\\n\\n“I have dined with him at his private house.”\\n\\n“I fancy,” said Estella, shrinking “that must be a curious place.”\\n\\n“It is a curious place.”\\n\\nI should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with\\nher; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe\\nthe dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden\\nglare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive\\nwith that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out\\nof it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in\\nlightning.\\n\\nSo we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by\\nwhich we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this\\nside of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she\\ntold me, for she had never left Miss Havisham’s neighbourhood until she\\nhad gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in\\ngoing and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her\\nwhile she remained here? To that she emphatically said “God forbid!”\\nand no more.\\n\\nIt was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;\\nthat she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task\\nhad needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she\\nhad not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should\\nhave felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose\\nto do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to\\ncrush it and throw it away.\\n\\nWhen we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew\\nPocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I\\nhoped I should see her sometimes.\\n\\n“O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you\\nare to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.”\\n\\nI inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?\\n\\n“No; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of\\nsome station, though not averse to increasing her income.”\\n\\n“I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.”\\n\\n“It is a part of Miss Havisham’s plans for me, Pip,” said Estella, with\\na sigh, as if she were tired; “I am to write to her constantly and see\\nher regularly and report how I go on,—I and the jewels,—for they are\\nnearly all mine now.”\\n\\nIt was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she\\ndid so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.\\n\\nWe came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house\\nby the green,—a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,\\nembroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their\\ncourt days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still\\ncut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and\\nstiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of\\nthe dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go\\nthe silent way of the rest.\\n\\nA bell with an old voice—which I dare say in its time had often said to\\nthe house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted\\nsword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire—sounded\\ngravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-coloured maids came fluttering\\nout to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she\\ngave me her hand and a smile, and said good-night, and was absorbed\\nlikewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I\\nshould be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy\\nwith her, but always miserable.\\n\\nI got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in\\nwith a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At our\\nown door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party\\nescorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite\\nof his being subject to Flopson.\\n\\nMr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer on\\ndomestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children and\\nservants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. But\\nMrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of\\nthe baby’s having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him\\nquiet during the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot\\nGuards) of Millers. And more needles were missing than it could be\\nregarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either\\nto apply externally or to take as a tonic.\\n\\nMr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical\\nadvice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a\\nhighly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging\\nhim to accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as\\nshe sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a\\nsovereign remedy for baby, I thought—Well—No, I wouldn’t.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXXIV.\\n\\n\\nAs I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to\\nnotice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on\\nmy own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,\\nbut I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of\\nchronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe. My conscience was\\nnot by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the\\nnight,—like Camilla,—I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits,\\nthat I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss\\nHavisham’s face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners with\\nJoe in the honest old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat\\nalone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like\\nthe forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.\\n\\nYet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of\\nmind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part\\nin its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,\\nand yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my\\nsatisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the\\ninfluence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so\\nI perceived—though dimly enough perhaps—that it was not beneficial to\\nanybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert. My\\nlavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not\\nafford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace\\nwith anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having\\nunwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor\\narts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural bent,\\nand would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them\\nslumbering. But Herbert’s was a very different case, and it often\\ncaused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in\\ncrowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery\\nwork, and placing the Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.\\n\\nSo now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began\\nto contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert must\\nbegin too, so he soon followed. At Startop’s suggestion, we put\\nourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the\\nGrove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were\\nnot that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to\\nquarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause\\nsix waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying\\nsocial ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I\\nunderstood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast\\nof the society: which ran “Gentlemen, may the present promotion of good\\nfeeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.”\\n\\nThe Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was in\\nCovent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honour of\\njoining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about\\ntown in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts\\nat the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of his\\nequipage headforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion\\ndeliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way—like\\ncoals. But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could\\nnot be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of\\nage.\\n\\nIn my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken\\nHerbert’s expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make\\nno such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in every\\ndirection, and continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into\\nkeeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him\\nwith a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about\\nhim more hopefully about midday; that he drooped when he came into\\ndinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather\\nclearly, after dinner; that he all but realised Capital towards\\nmidnight; and that at about two o’clock in the morning, he became so\\ndeeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to\\nAmerica, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his\\nfortune.\\n\\nI was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at\\nHammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert\\nwould often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those\\nseasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that\\nthe opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the\\ngeneral tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere,\\nwas a thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew\\ngreyer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by\\nthe hair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool,\\nread her book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about\\nher grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it\\ninto bed whenever it attracted her notice.\\n\\nAs I am now generalising a period of my life with the object of\\nclearing my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once\\ncompleting the description of our usual manners and customs at\\nBarnard’s Inn.\\n\\nWe spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people\\ncould make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less\\nmiserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.\\nThere was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying\\nourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my\\nbelief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.\\n\\nEvery morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look\\nabout him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which he\\nconsorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an\\nalmanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I\\never saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what we\\nundertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a\\nRepublic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except\\nat a certain hour of every afternoon to “go to Lloyd’s”—in observance\\nof a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything\\nelse in connection with Lloyd’s that I could find out, except come back\\nagain. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively\\nmust find an opening, he would go on ’Change at a busy time, and walk\\nin and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the\\nassembled magnates. “For,” says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on\\none of those special occasions, “I find the truth to be, Handel, that\\nan opening won’t come to one, but one must go to it,—so I have been.”\\n\\nIf we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated\\none another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond\\nexpression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight\\nof the Avenger’s livery; which had a more expensive and a less\\nremunerative appearance then than at any other time in the\\nfour-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast\\nbecame a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at\\nbreakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, “not\\nunwholly unconnected,” as my local paper might put it, “with jewelery,”\\nI went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him\\noff his feet,—so that he was actually in the air, like a booted\\nCupid,—for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.\\n\\nAt certain times—meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our\\nhumour—I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,—\\n\\n“My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.”\\n\\n“My dear Handel,” Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, “if you\\nwill believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange\\ncoincidence.”\\n\\n“Then, Herbert,” I would respond, “let us look into our affairs.”\\n\\nWe always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for\\nthis purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to\\nconfront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And\\nI know Herbert thought so too.\\n\\nWe ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of\\nsomething similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds\\nmight be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the\\nmark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of\\nink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was\\nsomething very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.\\n\\nI would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in\\na neat hand, the heading, “Memorandum of Pip’s debts”; with Barnard’s\\nInn and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet\\nof paper, and write across it with similar formalities, “Memorandum of\\nHerbert’s debts.”\\n\\nEach of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,\\nwhich had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half\\nburnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and\\notherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us\\nexceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to\\ndistinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually\\npaying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things\\nseemed about equal.\\n\\nWhen we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?\\nHerbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful\\nmanner at the sight of his accumulating figures.\\n\\n“They are mounting up, Handel,” Herbert would say; “upon my life, they\\nare mounting up.”\\n\\n“Be firm, Herbert,” I would retort, plying my own pen with great\\nassiduity. “Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare\\nthem out of countenance.”\\n\\n“So I would, Handel, only they are staring _me_ out of countenance.”\\n\\nHowever, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would\\nfall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the\\nplea that he had not got Cobbs’s bill, or Lobbs’s, or Nobbs’s, as the\\ncase might be.\\n\\n“Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it\\ndown.”\\n\\n“What a fellow of resource you are!” my friend would reply, with\\nadmiration. “Really your business powers are very remarkable.”\\n\\nI thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions, the\\nreputation of a first-rate man of business,—prompt, decisive,\\nenergetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities\\ndown upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My\\nself-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.\\nWhen I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,\\ndocketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical\\nbundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not\\nmy administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into\\na focus for him.\\n\\nMy business habits had one other bright feature, which I called\\n“leaving a Margin.” For example; supposing Herbert’s debts to be one\\nhundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, “Leave a\\nmargin, and put them down at two hundred.” Or, supposing my own to be\\nfour times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven\\nhundred. I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin,\\nbut I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have\\nbeen an expensive device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately,\\nto the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of\\nfreedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into another\\nmargin.\\n\\nBut there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these\\nexaminations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable\\nopinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert’s\\ncompliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the\\ntable before me among the stationery, and feel like a Bank of some\\nsort, rather than a private individual.\\n\\nWe shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we\\nmight not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one\\nevening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said\\ndoor, and fall on the ground. “It’s for you, Handel,” said Herbert,\\ngoing out and coming back with it, “and I hope there is nothing the\\nmatter.” This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border.\\n\\nThe letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that I\\nwas an honoured sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.\\nGargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past\\nsix in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the\\ninterment on Monday next at three o’clock in the afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXXV.\\n\\n\\nIt was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and\\nthe gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my\\nsister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That\\nthe place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed\\nunable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my\\nthoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming\\ntowards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the\\ndoor. In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated,\\nthere was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of\\nthe sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she\\nwere still alive and had been often there.\\n\\nWhatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my\\nsister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret\\nwhich may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and\\nperhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized\\nwith a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had\\nsuffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have\\nrevengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.\\n\\nHaving written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him that\\nI would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the\\ncurious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the\\nmorning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the\\nforge.\\n\\nIt was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times\\nwhen I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,\\nvividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that\\nsoftened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the\\nbeans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it\\nwould be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should\\nbe softened as they thought of me.\\n\\nAt last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co.\\nhad put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally\\nabsurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a\\nblack bandage,—as if that instrument could possibly communicate any\\ncomfort to anybody,—were posted at the front door; and in one of them I\\nrecognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young\\ncouple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of\\nintoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped\\nround the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, and\\nmost of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed\\nwindows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two\\nwarders (the postboy) knocked at the door,—implying that I was far too\\nmuch exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.\\n\\nAnother sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a\\nwager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlour. Here, Mr.\\nTrabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves\\nup, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity\\nof black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished\\nputting somebody’s hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby;\\nso he held out his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and\\nconfused by the occasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of\\nwarm affection.\\n\\nPoor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow\\nunder his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,\\nas chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent\\ndown and said to him, “Dear Joe, how are you?” he said, “Pip, old chap,\\nyou knowed her when she were a fine figure of a—” and clasped my hand\\nand said no more.\\n\\nBiddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly\\nhere and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as I\\nthought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and\\nthere began to wonder in what part of the house it—she—my sister—was.\\nThe air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I\\nlooked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible\\nuntil one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum\\ncake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and\\nbiscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had\\nnever seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.\\nStanding at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook\\nin a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately\\nstuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my\\nattention. The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathing\\nsherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, “May I, dear sir?” and\\ndid. I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent\\nspeechless paroxysm in a corner. We were all going to “follow,” and\\nwere all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) into\\nridiculous bundles.\\n\\n“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.\\nTrabb called “formed” in the parlour, two and two,—and it was\\ndreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; “which I\\nmeantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the\\nchurch myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it\\nwith willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbours\\nwould look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in\\nrespect.”\\n\\n“Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!” cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a\\ndepressed business-like voice. “Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are\\nready!”\\n\\nSo we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses\\nwere bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and\\nPumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had\\nbeen brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of\\nUndertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded\\nunder a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole\\nlooked like a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and\\nblundering along, under the guidance of two keepers,—the postboy and\\nhis comrade.\\n\\nThe neighbourhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and\\nwe were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful\\nand vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us\\noff, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such\\ntimes the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on\\nour emergence round some corner of expectancy, “_Here_ they come!”\\n“_Here_ they are!” and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was\\nmuch annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted\\nall the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband,\\nand smoothing my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the\\nexcessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited\\nand vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.\\n\\nAnd now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the\\nships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,\\nclose to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this\\nparish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was\\nlaid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the\\nlight wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.\\n\\nOf the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,\\nI desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even\\nwhen those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it\\nbrought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it\\nfleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him\\ncough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came\\nunexpectedly into large property. When we got back, he had the\\nhardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had\\ndone her so much honour, and to hint that she would have considered it\\nreasonably purchased at the price of her death. After that, he drank\\nall the rest of the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two\\ntalked (which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) as\\nif they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were\\nnotoriously immortal. Finally, he went away with Mr. and Mrs.\\nHubble,—to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the Jolly\\nBargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest\\nbenefactor.\\n\\nWhen they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men—but not his Boy; I\\nlooked for him—had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,\\nthe house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a\\ncold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlour, not in the old\\nkitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his\\nknife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great\\nrestraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe, and\\nwhen I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down\\ntogether on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I\\nnoticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to\\nmake a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress; in which\\nthe dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.\\n\\nHe was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little\\nroom, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great\\nthing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing\\nin, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a\\nlittle talk.\\n\\n“Biddy,” said I, “I think you might have written to me about these sad\\nmatters.”\\n\\n“Do you, Mr. Pip?” said Biddy. “I should have written if I had thought\\nthat.”\\n\\n“Don’t suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider\\nthat you ought to have thought that.”\\n\\n“Do you, Mr. Pip?”\\n\\nShe was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with\\nher, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. After\\nlooking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave\\nup that point.\\n\\n“I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy\\ndear?”\\n\\n“Oh! I can’t do so, Mr. Pip,” said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still\\nof quiet conviction. “I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am\\ngoing to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of\\nMr. Gargery, together, until he settles down.”\\n\\n“How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo—”\\n\\n“How am I going to live?” repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary\\nflush upon her face. “I’ll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get\\nthe place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be\\nwell recommended by all the neighbours, and I hope I can be industrious\\nand patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,”\\npursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, “the\\nnew schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you\\nafter that time, and have had time since then to improve.”\\n\\n“I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.”\\n\\n“Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature,” murmured Biddy.\\n\\nIt was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!\\nI thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further\\nwith Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.\\n\\n“I have not heard the particulars of my sister’s death, Biddy.”\\n\\n“They are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad\\nstates—though they had got better of late, rather than worse—for four\\ndays, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and\\nsaid quite plainly, ‘Joe.’ As she had never said any word for a long\\nwhile, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs\\nto me that she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to\\nput her arms round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid\\nher head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she\\npresently said ‘Joe’ again, and once ‘Pardon,’ and once ‘Pip.’ And so\\nshe never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour later\\nwhen we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.”\\n\\nBiddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that\\nwere coming out, were blurred in my own sight.\\n\\n“Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?”\\n\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\n“Do you know what is become of Orlick?”\\n\\n“I should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in\\nthe quarries.”\\n\\n“Of course you have seen him then?—Why are you looking at that dark\\ntree in the lane?”\\n\\n“I saw him there, on the night she died.”\\n\\n“That was not the last time either, Biddy?”\\n\\n“No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.—It is of\\nno use,” said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running\\nout, “you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and\\nhe is gone.”\\n\\nIt revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by\\nthis fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told\\nher that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of\\nthat country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she\\ntold me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,—she\\ndidn’t say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,—but ever did\\nhis duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a\\ngentle heart.\\n\\n“Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,” said I; “and Biddy,\\nwe must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often\\ndown here now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.”\\n\\nBiddy said never a single word.\\n\\n“Biddy, don’t you hear me?”\\n\\n“Yes, Mr. Pip.”\\n\\n“Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,—which appears to me to be in\\nbad taste, Biddy,—what do you mean?”\\n\\n“What do I mean?” asked Biddy, timidly.\\n\\n“Biddy,” said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, “I must request\\nto know what you mean by this?”\\n\\n“By this?” said Biddy.\\n\\n“Now, don’t echo,” I retorted. “You used not to echo, Biddy.”\\n\\n“Used not!” said Biddy. “O Mr. Pip! Used!”\\n\\nWell! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another\\nsilent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.\\n\\n“Biddy,” said I, “I made a remark respecting my coming down here often,\\nto see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the\\ngoodness, Biddy, to tell me why.”\\n\\n“Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?” asked\\nBiddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the\\nstars with a clear and honest eye.\\n\\n“O dear me!” said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in\\ndespair. “This really is a very bad side of human nature! Don’t say any\\nmore, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.”\\n\\nFor which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and\\nwhen I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of\\nher as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the\\nchurchyard and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the\\nnight, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an\\nunkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.\\n\\nEarly in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and\\nlooking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There I\\nstood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of\\nhealth and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright\\nsun of the life in store for him were shining on it.\\n\\n“Good-bye, dear Joe!—No, don’t wipe it off—for God’s sake, give me your\\nblackened hand!—I shall be down soon and often.”\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“Never too soon, sir,” said Joe, “and never too often, Pip!”\\n\\nBiddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk\\nand a crust of bread. “Biddy,” said I, when I gave her my hand at\\nparting, “I am not angry, but I am hurt.”\\n\\n“No, don’t be hurt,” she pleaded quite pathetically; “let only me be\\nhurt, if I have been ungenerous.”\\n\\nOnce more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to\\nme, as I suspect they did, that I should _not_ come back, and that\\nBiddy was quite right, all I can say is,—they were quite right too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXXVI.\\n\\n\\nHerbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our\\ndebts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like\\nexemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a\\nway of doing; and I came of age,—in fulfilment of Herbert’s prediction,\\nthat I should do so before I knew where I was.\\n\\nHerbert himself had come of age eight months before me. As he had\\nnothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make a\\nprofound sensation in Barnard’s Inn. But we had looked forward to my\\none-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and\\nanticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly\\nhelp saying something definite on that occasion.\\n\\nI had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my\\nbirthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from\\nWemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call\\nupon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced\\nus that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual\\nflutter when I repaired to my guardian’s office, a model of\\npunctuality.\\n\\nIn the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and\\nincidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of\\ntissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting\\nit, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian’s room. It was\\nNovember, and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back\\nagainst the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.\\n\\n“Well, Pip,” said he, “I must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations,\\nMr. Pip.”\\n\\nWe shook hands,—he was always a remarkably short shaker,—and I thanked\\nhim.\\n\\n“Take a chair, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian.\\n\\nAs I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his\\nboots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time\\nwhen I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the\\nshelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were\\nmaking a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.\\n\\n“Now my young friend,” my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the\\nbox, “I am going to have a word or two with you.”\\n\\n“If you please, sir.”\\n\\n“What do you suppose,” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the\\nground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,—“what\\ndo you suppose you are living at the rate of?”\\n\\n“At the rate of, sir?”\\n\\n“At,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,\\n“the—rate—of?” And then looked all round the room, and paused with his\\npocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.\\n\\nI had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed\\nany slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,\\nI confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply\\nseemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, “I thought so!” and blew his\\nnose with an air of satisfaction.\\n\\n“Now, I have asked _you_ a question, my friend,” said Mr. Jaggers.\\n“Have you anything to ask _me_?”\\n\\n“Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several\\nquestions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.”\\n\\n“Ask one,” said Mr. Jaggers.\\n\\n“Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?”\\n\\n“No. Ask another.”\\n\\n“Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?”\\n\\n“Waive that, a moment,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and ask another.”\\n\\nI looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from\\nthe inquiry, “Have-I—anything to receive, sir?” On that, Mr. Jaggers\\nsaid, triumphantly, “I thought we should come to it!” and called to\\nWemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it\\nin, and disappeared.\\n\\n“Now, Mr. Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “attend, if you please. You have been\\ndrawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick’s\\ncash-book; but you are in debt, of course?”\\n\\n“I am afraid I must say yes, sir.”\\n\\n“You know you must say yes; don’t you?” said Mr. Jaggers.\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“I don’t ask you what you owe, because you don’t know; and if you did\\nknow, you wouldn’t tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,”\\ncried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show of\\nprotesting: “it’s likely enough that you think you wouldn’t, but you\\nwould. You’ll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this\\npiece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it\\nand tell me what it is.”\\n\\n“This is a bank-note,” said I, “for five hundred pounds.”\\n\\n“That is a bank-note,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, “for five hundred pounds.\\nAnd a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?”\\n\\n“How could I do otherwise!”\\n\\n“Ah! But answer the question,” said Mr. Jaggers.\\n\\n“Undoubtedly.”\\n\\n“You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that\\nhandsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this\\nday, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome\\nsum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until\\nthe donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your\\nmoney affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from\\nWemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are\\nin communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere\\nagent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my\\ninstructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but\\nI am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.”\\n\\nI was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great\\nliberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. “I am\\nnot paid, Pip,” said he, coolly, “to carry your words to any one;” and\\nthen gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and\\nstood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against\\nhim.\\n\\nAfter a pause, I hinted,—\\n\\n“There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to\\nwaive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it\\nagain?”\\n\\n“What is it?” said he.\\n\\nI might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me\\naback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new.\\n“Is it likely,” I said, after hesitating, “that my patron, the\\nfountain-head you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon—” there I\\ndelicately stopped.\\n\\n“Will soon what?” asked Mr. Jaggers. “That’s no question as it stands,\\nyou know.”\\n\\n“Will soon come to London,” said I, after casting about for a precise\\nform of words, “or summon me anywhere else?”\\n\\n“Now, here,” replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with his\\ndark deep-set eyes, “we must revert to the evening when we first\\nencountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then,\\nPip?”\\n\\n“You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that\\nperson appeared.”\\n\\n“Just so,” said Mr. Jaggers, “that’s my answer.”\\n\\nAs we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my\\nstrong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came\\nquicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I\\nhad less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.\\n\\n“Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?”\\n\\nMr. Jaggers shook his head,—not in negativing the question, but in\\naltogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer\\nit,—and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when my\\neyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their\\nsuspended attention, and were going to sneeze.\\n\\n“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs\\nof his warmed hands, “I’ll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That’s a\\nquestion I must not be asked. You’ll understand that better, when I\\ntell you it’s a question that might compromise _me_. Come! I’ll go a\\nlittle further with you; I’ll say something more.”\\n\\nHe bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the\\ncalves of his legs in the pause he made.\\n\\n“When that person discloses,” said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,\\n“you and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person\\ndiscloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that\\nperson discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything\\nabout it. And that’s all I have got to say.”\\n\\nWe looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked\\nthoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion\\nthat Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him\\ninto her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he\\nresented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did\\nobject to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I\\nraised my eyes again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me\\nall the time, and was doing so still.\\n\\n“If that is all you have to say, sir,” I remarked, “there can be\\nnothing left for me to say.”\\n\\nHe nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked me\\nwhere I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.\\nAs a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favour us with his\\ncompany, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted on\\nwalking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation\\nfor him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had\\nhis hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk\\nto Wemmick.\\n\\nThe fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my\\npocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often there\\nbefore; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise\\nwith concerning such thought.\\n\\nHe had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going\\nhome. He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office\\ncandlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near\\nthe door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his\\nhat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest\\nwith his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.\\n\\n“Mr. Wemmick,” said I, “I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous\\nto serve a friend.”\\n\\nWemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion\\nwere dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.\\n\\n“This friend,” I pursued, “is trying to get on in commercial life, but\\nhas no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a\\nbeginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.”\\n\\n“With money down?” said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.\\n\\n“With _some_ money down,” I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot\\nacross me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home—“with _some_\\nmoney down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.”\\n\\n“Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, “I should like just to run over with you on my\\nfingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as\\nChelsea Reach. Let’s see; there’s London, one; Southwark, two;\\nBlackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.”\\nHe had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his\\nsafe-key on the palm of his hand. “There’s as many as six, you see, to\\nchoose from.”\\n\\n“I don’t understand you,” said I.\\n\\n“Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,” returned Wemmick, “and take a walk upon\\nyour bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch\\nof your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and\\nyou may know the end of it too,—but it’s a less pleasant and profitable\\nend.”\\n\\nI could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after\\nsaying this.\\n\\n“This is very discouraging,” said I.\\n\\n“Meant to be so,” said Wemmick.\\n\\n“Then is it your opinion,” I inquired, with some little indignation,\\n“that a man should never—”\\n\\n“—Invest portable property in a friend?” said Wemmick. “Certainly he\\nshould not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,—and then it\\nbecomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get\\nrid of him.”\\n\\n“And that,” said I, “is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?”\\n\\n“That,” he returned, “is my deliberate opinion in this office.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole\\nhere; “but would that be your opinion at Walworth?”\\n\\n“Mr. Pip,” he replied, with gravity, “Walworth is one place, and this\\noffice is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is\\nanother. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments\\nmust be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken\\nin this office.”\\n\\n“Very well,” said I, much relieved, “then I shall look you up at\\nWalworth, you may depend upon it.”\\n\\n“Mr. Pip,” he returned, “you will be welcome there, in a private and\\npersonal capacity.”\\n\\nWe had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my\\nguardian’s ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in\\nhis doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and\\nstood by to snuff out the candles. We all three went into the street\\ntogether, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr.\\nJaggers and I turned ours.\\n\\nI could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers\\nhad had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a\\nSomebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable\\nconsideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all\\nseemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he\\nmade of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than\\nWemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to\\ndinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy,\\nbecause, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes\\nfixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and\\nforgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXXVII.\\n\\n\\nDeeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick’s Walworth\\nsentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage\\nto the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union\\nJack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of\\ndefiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most\\npacific manner by the Aged.\\n\\n“My son, sir,” said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, “rather\\nhad it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word\\nthat he would soon be home from his afternoon’s walk. He is very\\nregular in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my\\nson.”\\n\\nI nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and\\nwe went in and sat down by the fireside.\\n\\n“You made acquaintance with my son, sir,” said the old man, in his\\nchirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, “at his office, I\\nexpect?” I nodded. “Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand\\nat his business, sir?” I nodded hard. “Yes; so they tell me. His\\nbusiness is the Law?” I nodded harder. “Which makes it more surprising\\nin my son,” said the old man, “for he was not brought up to the Law,\\nbut to the Wine-Coopering.”\\n\\nCurious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the\\nreputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into\\nthe greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very\\nsprightly manner, “No, to be sure; you’re right.” And to this hour I\\nhave not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I\\nhad made.\\n\\nAs I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making\\nsome other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his\\nown calling in life had been “the Wine-Coopering.” By dint of straining\\nthat term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on\\nthe chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my\\nmeaning understood.\\n\\n“No,” said the old gentleman; “the warehousing, the warehousing. First,\\nover yonder;” he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he\\nintended to refer me to Liverpool; “and then in the City of London\\nhere. However, having an infirmity—for I am hard of hearing, sir—”\\n\\nI expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.\\n\\n“—Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he\\nwent into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and\\nlittle made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to\\nwhat you said, you know,” pursued the old man, again laughing heartily,\\n“what I say is, No to be sure; you’re right.”\\n\\nI was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled\\nme to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this\\nimaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall\\non one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little\\nwooden flap with “JOHN” upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried\\nwith great triumph, “My son’s come home!” and we both went out to the\\ndrawbridge.\\n\\nIt was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the\\nother side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with\\nthe greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,\\nthat I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had\\ncome across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he\\nwas accompanied.\\n\\nMiss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in\\nthe post-office branch of the service. She might have been some two or\\nthree years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed\\nof portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both\\nbefore and behind, made her figure very like a boy’s kite; and I might\\nhave pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves\\na little too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of\\nfellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in\\ndiscovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our\\ngoing in, and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for\\nannouncing himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a\\nmoment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently\\nanother click came, and another little door tumbled open with “Miss\\nSkiffins” on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then\\nMiss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up\\ntogether. On Wemmick’s return from working these mechanical appliances,\\nI expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he\\nsaid, “Well, you know, they’re both pleasant and useful to the Aged.\\nAnd by George, sir, it’s a thing worth mentioning, that of all the\\npeople who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known\\nto the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!”\\n\\n“And Mr. Wemmick made them,” added Miss Skiffins, “with his own hands\\nout of his own head.”\\n\\nWhile Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green\\ngloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was\\ncompany), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the\\nproperty, and see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that he\\ndid this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I\\nseized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.\\n\\nHaving thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I\\nhad never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in\\nbehalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how\\nwe had fought. I glanced at Herbert’s home, and at his character, and\\nat his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;\\nthose, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had\\nderived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I\\nconfessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might\\nhave done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham\\nin the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the\\npossibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the\\ncertainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any\\nmean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told\\nWemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a\\ngreat affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some\\nrays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick’s experience\\nand knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my\\nresources to help Herbert to some present income,—say of a hundred a\\nyear, to keep him in good hope and heart,—and gradually to buy him on\\nto some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to\\nunderstand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert’s\\nknowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world\\nwith whom I could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon his\\nshoulder, and saying, “I can’t help confiding in you, though I know it\\nmust be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever\\nbrought me here.”\\n\\nWemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of\\nstart, “Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is\\ndevilish good of you.”\\n\\n“Say you’ll help me to be good then,” said I.\\n\\n“Ecod,” replied Wemmick, shaking his head, “that’s not my trade.”\\n\\n“Nor is this your trading-place,” said I.\\n\\n“You are right,” he returned. “You hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,\\nI’ll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be\\ndone by degrees. Skiffins (that’s her brother) is an accountant and\\nagent. I’ll look him up and go to work for you.”\\n\\n“I thank you ten thousand times.”\\n\\n“On the contrary,” said he, “I thank you, for though we are strictly in\\nour private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there\\n_are_ Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.”\\n\\nAfter a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned\\ninto the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The\\nresponsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and\\nthat excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me\\nin some danger of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were\\ngoing to make, but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a\\nhay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it as\\nit simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss\\nSkiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises\\nbecame strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire to\\nparticipate in the entertainment.\\n\\nThe flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right\\nmoment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth\\nas if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed\\nthe tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of\\nJohn and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some\\nspasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I\\ngot used to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss\\nSkiffins’s arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and\\nI rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the\\nprofile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very\\nnew moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her by\\nWemmick.\\n\\nWe ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was\\ndelightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged\\nespecially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage\\ntribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins—in the\\nabsence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of\\nher family on Sunday afternoons—washed up the tea-things, in a trifling\\nlady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on\\nher gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, “Now,\\nAged Parent, tip us the paper.”\\n\\nWemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that\\nthis was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman\\ninfinite satisfaction to read the news aloud. “I won’t offer an\\napology,” said Wemmick, “for he isn’t capable of many pleasures—are\\nyou, Aged P.?”\\n\\n“All right, John, all right,” returned the old man, seeing himself\\nspoken to.\\n\\n“Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,”\\nsaid Wemmick, “and he’ll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,\\nAged One.”\\n\\n“All right, John, all right!” returned the cheerful old man, so busy\\nand so pleased, that it really was quite charming.\\n\\nThe Aged’s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle’s\\ngreat-aunt’s, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come\\nthrough a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was\\nalways on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into\\nthem, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was\\nequally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,\\nquite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we all\\nexpressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he\\nresumed again.\\n\\nAs Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a\\nshadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.\\nWemmick’s mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually\\nstealing his arm round Miss Skiffins’s waist. In course of time I saw\\nhis hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment\\nMiss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm\\nagain as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest\\ndeliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins’s composure\\nwhile she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever\\nseen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction\\nof mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it\\nmechanically.\\n\\nBy and by, I noticed Wemmick’s arm beginning to disappear again, and\\ngradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to\\nwiden again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite\\nenthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side\\nof Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness\\nof a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid\\nit on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am\\njustified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged’s reading,\\nWemmick’s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled\\nto it by Miss Skiffins.\\n\\nAt last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time\\nfor Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black\\nbottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical\\ndignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these\\nappliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who\\nwas soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and\\nWemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer\\nto see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had\\nbest go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and\\nhaving passed a pleasant evening.\\n\\nBefore a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,\\nstating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter\\nappertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would\\nbe glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out to\\nWalworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by\\nappointment in the City several times, but never held any communication\\nwith him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that\\nwe found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long\\nestablished in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted\\ncapital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a\\npartner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which\\nHerbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds\\ndown, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at\\ncertain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my\\nproperty. Miss Skiffins’s brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick\\npervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.\\n\\nThe whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the\\nleast suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the\\nradiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a\\nmighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the\\nyoung merchant’s name), and of Clarriker’s having shown an\\nextraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that the\\nopening had come at last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his\\nface brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionate\\nfriend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of\\ntriumph when I saw him so happy. At length, the thing being done, and\\nhe having that day entered Clarriker’s House, and he having talked to\\nme for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really\\ncry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations\\nhad done some good to somebody.\\n\\nA great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my\\nview. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all\\nthe changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not\\nmuch to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXXVIII.\\n\\n\\nIf that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to\\nbe haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O\\nthe many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within\\nme haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where it\\nwould, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that\\nhouse.\\n\\nThe lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a\\nwidow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother\\nlooked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother’s complexion was\\npink, and the daughter’s was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,\\nand the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good\\nposition, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,\\nif any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but\\nthe understanding was established that they were necessary to her, and\\nthat she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss\\nHavisham’s before the time of her seclusion.\\n\\nIn Mrs. Brandley’s house and out of Mrs. Brandley’s house, I suffered\\nevery kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The\\nnature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of\\nfamiliarity without placing me on terms of favour, conduced to my\\ndistraction. She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned\\nthe very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a\\nconstant slight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary,\\nsteward, half-brother, poor relation,—if I had been a younger brother\\nof her appointed husband,—I could not have seemed to myself further\\nfrom my hopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her\\nby her name and hearing her call me by mine became, under the\\ncircumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely\\nthat it almost maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it\\nalmost maddened me.\\n\\nShe had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of\\nevery one who went near her; but there were more than enough of them\\nwithout that.\\n\\nI saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used\\noften to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics,\\nfête days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,\\nthrough which I pursued her,—and they were all miseries to me. I never\\nhad one hour’s happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the\\nfour-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with\\nme unto death.\\n\\nThroughout this part of our intercourse,—and it lasted, as will\\npresently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,—she habitually\\nreverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced\\nupon us. There were other times when she would come to a sudden check\\nin this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.\\n\\n“Pip, Pip,” she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat\\napart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; “will you never\\ntake warning?”\\n\\n“Of what?”\\n\\n“Of me.”\\n\\n“Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?”\\n\\n“Do I mean! If you don’t know what I mean, you are blind.”\\n\\nI should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the\\nreason that I always was restrained—and this was not the least of my\\nmiseries—by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,\\nwhen she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My\\ndread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy\\ndisadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious\\nstruggle in her bosom.\\n\\n“At any rate,” said I, “I have no warning given me just now, for you\\nwrote to me to come to you, this time.”\\n\\n“That’s true,” said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always\\nchilled me.\\n\\nAfter looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on\\nto say:—\\n\\n“The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day\\nat Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She\\nwould rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,\\nfor she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can\\nyou take me?”\\n\\n“Can I take you, Estella!”\\n\\n“You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay\\nall charges out of my purse. You hear the condition of your going?”\\n\\n“And must obey,” said I.\\n\\nThis was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others\\nlike it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as\\nseen her handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we\\nfound her in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless\\nto add that there was no change in Satis House.\\n\\nShe was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I\\nlast saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was\\nsomething positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.\\nShe hung upon Estella’s beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her\\ngestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked\\nat her, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had\\nreared.\\n\\nFrom Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to\\npry into my heart and probe its wounds. “How does she use you, Pip; how\\ndoes she use you?” she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,\\neven in Estella’s hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire at\\nnight, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella’s hand drawn\\nthrough her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her, by\\ndint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular\\nletters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;\\nand as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind\\nmortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch\\nstick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a\\nvery spectre.\\n\\nI saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of\\ndependence and even of degradation that it awakened,—I saw in this that\\nEstella was set to wreak Miss Havisham’s revenge on men, and that she\\nwas not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw\\nin this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her\\nout to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with\\nthe malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,\\nand that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in\\nthis that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even\\nwhile the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my\\nbeing staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian’s\\ndeclining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.\\nIn a word, I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there\\nbefore my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in\\nthis, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which\\nher life was hidden from the sun.\\n\\nThe candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on\\nthe wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the\\nsteady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I\\nlooked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the\\nstopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the\\ntable and the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly\\nreflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I\\nsaw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated\\nand thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across\\nthe landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it\\nwere, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the\\ncrawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as\\nthey betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the\\ngropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.\\n\\nIt happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose\\nbetween Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever\\nseen them opposed.\\n\\nWe were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham\\nstill had Estella’s arm drawn through her own, and still clutched\\nEstella’s hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.\\nShe had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather\\nendured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.\\n\\n“What!” said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, “are you tired\\nof me?”\\n\\n“Only a little tired of myself,” replied Estella, disengaging her arm,\\nand moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at\\nthe fire.\\n\\n“Speak the truth, you ingrate!” cried Miss Havisham, passionately\\nstriking her stick upon the floor; “you are tired of me.”\\n\\nEstella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down at\\nthe fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a\\nself-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was\\nalmost cruel.\\n\\n“You stock and stone!” exclaimed Miss Havisham. “You cold, cold heart!”\\n\\n“What?” said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she\\nleaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; “do\\nyou reproach me for being cold? You?”\\n\\n“Are you not?” was the fierce retort.\\n\\n“You should know,” said Estella. “I am what you have made me. Take all\\nthe praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the\\nfailure; in short, take me.”\\n\\n“O, look at her, look at her!” cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; “Look at\\nher so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where I\\ntook her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its\\nstabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!”\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“At least I was no party to the compact,” said Estella, “for if I could\\nwalk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But\\nwhat would you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe\\neverything to you. What would you have?”\\n\\n“Love,” replied the other.\\n\\n“You have it.”\\n\\n“I have not,” said Miss Havisham.\\n\\n“Mother by adoption,” retorted Estella, never departing from the easy\\ngrace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never\\nyielding either to anger or tenderness,—“mother by adoption, I have\\nsaid that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. All\\nthat you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that,\\nI have nothing. And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me,\\nmy gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.”\\n\\n“Did I never give her love!” cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.\\n“Did I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all\\ntimes, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me! Let her call\\nme mad, let her call me mad!”\\n\\n“Why should I call you mad,” returned Estella, “I, of all people? Does\\nany one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I\\ndo? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as\\nwell as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool\\nthat is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up\\ninto your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!”\\n\\n“Soon forgotten!” moaned Miss Havisham. “Times soon forgotten!”\\n\\n“No, not forgotten,” retorted Estella,—“not forgotten, but treasured up\\nin my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have\\nyou found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving\\nadmission here,” she touched her bosom with her hand, “to anything that\\nyou excluded? Be just to me.”\\n\\n“So proud, so proud!” moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her grey hair\\nwith both her hands.\\n\\n“Who taught me to be proud?” returned Estella. “Who praised me when I\\nlearnt my lesson?”\\n\\n“So hard, so hard!” moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.\\n\\n“Who taught me to be hard?” returned Estella. “Who praised me when I\\nlearnt my lesson?”\\n\\n“But to be proud and hard to _me_!” Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as\\nshe stretched out her arms. “Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and\\nhard to _me_!”\\n\\nEstella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was\\nnot otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down at\\nthe fire again.\\n\\n“I cannot think,” said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence “why\\nyou should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a\\nseparation. I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have\\nnever been unfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any\\nweakness that I can charge myself with.”\\n\\n“Would it be weakness to return my love?” exclaimed Miss Havisham. “But\\nyes, yes, she would call it so!”\\n\\n“I begin to think,” said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment\\nof calm wonder, “that I almost understand how this comes about. If you\\nhad brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of\\nthese rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing as\\nthe daylight by which she had never once seen your face,—if you had\\ndone that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand the\\ndaylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and\\nangry?”\\n\\nMiss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning,\\nand swaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.\\n\\n“Or,” said Estella,—“which is a nearer case,—if you had taught her,\\nfrom the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,\\nthat there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her\\nenemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had\\nblighted you and would else blight her;—if you had done this, and then,\\nfor a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she\\ncould not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?”\\n\\nMiss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see her\\nface), but still made no answer.\\n\\n“So,” said Estella, “I must be taken as I have been made. The success\\nis not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.”\\n\\nMiss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor,\\namong the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took\\nadvantage of the moment—I had sought one from the first—to leave the\\nroom, after beseeching Estella’s attention to her, with a movement of\\nmy hand. When I left, Estella was yet standing by the great\\nchimney-piece, just as she had stood throughout. Miss Havisham’s grey\\nhair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and\\nwas a miserable sight to see.\\n\\nIt was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an\\nhour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about\\nthe ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I\\nfound Estella sitting at Miss Havisham’s knee, taking up some stitches\\nin one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and\\nof which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old\\nbanners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella\\nand I played at cards, as of yore,—only we were skilful now, and played\\nFrench games,—and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.\\n\\nI lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first\\ntime I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to\\ncome near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this\\nside of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind\\nthe half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the\\nroom overhead, in the room beneath,—everywhere. At last, when the night\\nwas slow to creep on towards two o’clock, I felt that I absolutely\\ncould no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I\\nmust get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out\\nacross the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the\\nouter courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no\\nsooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss\\nHavisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I\\nfollowed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase. She\\ncarried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken from\\none of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly object by\\nits light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewed\\nair of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door, and I heard\\nher walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across again\\ninto that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I tried in the dark\\nboth to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some\\nstreaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands. During\\nthe whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, I\\nheard her footstep, saw her light pass above, and heard her ceaseless\\nlow cry.\\n\\nBefore we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between\\nher and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and\\nthere were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,\\ndid Miss Havisham’s manner towards Estella in anywise change, except\\nthat I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former\\ncharacteristics.\\n\\nIt is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley\\nDrummle’s name upon it; or I would, very gladly.\\n\\nOn a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and\\nwhen good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody’s\\nagreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to\\norder, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which,\\naccording to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute’s\\nturn to do that day. I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me\\nwhile the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost\\nbetween us, that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when\\nhe called upon the company to pledge him to “Estella!”\\n\\n“Estella who?” said I.\\n\\n“Never you mind,” retorted Drummle.\\n\\n“Estella of where?” said I. “You are bound to say of where.” Which he\\nwas, as a Finch.\\n\\n“Of Richmond, gentlemen,” said Drummle, putting me out of the question,\\n“and a peerless beauty.”\\n\\nMuch he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I\\nwhispered Herbert.\\n\\n“I know that lady,” said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had\\nbeen honoured.\\n\\n“_Do_ you?” said Drummle.\\n\\n“And so do I,” I added, with a scarlet face.\\n\\n“_Do_ you?” said Drummle. “_O_, Lord!”\\n\\nThis was the only retort—except glass or crockery—that the heavy\\ncreature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it\\nas if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place\\nand said that I could not but regard it as being like the honourable\\nFinch’s impudence to come down to that Grove,—we always talked about\\ncoming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of\\nexpression,—down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew\\nnothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by\\nthat? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew\\nwhere I was to be found.\\n\\nWhether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,\\nafter this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The\\ndebate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more\\nhonourable members told six more, during the discussion, that they\\nbelieved _they_ knew where _they_ were to be found. However, it was\\ndecided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr. Drummle\\nwould bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing that\\nhe had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret,\\nas a gentleman and a Finch, for “having been betrayed into a warmth\\nwhich.” Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honour\\nshould take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a\\npolite little avowal in Estella’s hand, that she had had the honour of\\ndancing with him several times. This left me no course but to regret\\nthat I had been “betrayed into a warmth which,” and on the whole to\\nrepudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.\\nDrummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the\\nGrove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the\\npromotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing\\nrate.\\n\\nI tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot\\nadequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should\\nshow any favour to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far\\nbelow the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been\\nreferable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my\\nlove for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to\\nthat hound. No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had\\nfavoured; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind\\nand degree of distress.\\n\\nIt was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle\\nhad begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. A\\nlittle while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed\\none another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, and\\nEstella held him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement,\\nnow almost flattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him\\nvery well, now scarcely remembering who he was.\\n\\nThe Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,\\nhowever, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had a\\nblockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness, which\\nsometimes did him good service,—almost taking the place of\\nconcentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching\\nEstella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil\\nhimself and drop at the right nick of time.\\n\\nAt a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls\\nat most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties,\\nthis blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration\\non her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took the\\nnext opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to\\ntake her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go. I\\nwas with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such\\nplaces.\\n\\n“Are you tired, Estella?”\\n\\n“Rather, Pip.”\\n\\n“You should be.”\\n\\n“Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to\\nwrite, before I go to sleep.”\\n\\n“Recounting to-night’s triumph?” said I. “Surely a very poor one,\\nEstella.”\\n\\n“What do you mean? I didn’t know there had been any.”\\n\\n“Estella,” said I, “do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is\\nlooking over here at us.”\\n\\n“Why should I look at him?” returned Estella, with her eyes on me\\ninstead. “What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,—to use\\nyour words,—that I need look at?”\\n\\n“Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,” said I. “For he\\nhas been hovering about you all night.”\\n\\n“Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,” replied Estella, with a\\nglance towards him, “hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help\\nit?”\\n\\n“No,” I returned; “but cannot the Estella help it?”\\n\\n“Well!” said she, laughing, after a moment, “perhaps. Yes. Anything you\\nlike.”\\n\\n“But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should\\nencourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is\\ndespised.”\\n\\n“Well?” said she.\\n\\n“You know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,\\nill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.”\\n\\n“Well?” said she.\\n\\n“You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous\\nroll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don’t you?”\\n\\n“Well?” said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her\\nlovely eyes the wider.\\n\\nTo overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it\\nfrom her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, “Well! Then, that is\\nwhy it makes me wretched.”\\n\\nNow, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any idea\\nof making me—me—wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;\\nbut in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the\\nquestion, that I could believe nothing of the kind.\\n\\n“Pip,” said Estella, casting her glance over the room, “don’t be\\nfoolish about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and\\nmay be meant to have. It’s not worth discussing.”\\n\\n“Yes it is,” said I, “because I cannot bear that people should say,\\n‘she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest\\nin the crowd.’”\\n\\n“I can bear it,” said Estella.\\n\\n“Oh! don’t be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.”\\n\\n“Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!” said Estella, opening\\nher hands. “And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a\\nboor!”\\n\\n“There is no doubt you do,” said I, something hurriedly, “for I have\\nseen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never\\ngive to—me.”\\n\\n“Do you want me then,” said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and\\nserious, if not angry, look, “to deceive and entrap you?”\\n\\n“Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?”\\n\\n“Yes, and many others,—all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I’ll\\nsay no more.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled\\nmy heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on\\nunhindered, to the event that had impended over me longer yet; the\\nevent that had begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world\\nheld Estella, and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving\\nits first distortions from Miss Havisham’s wasting hands.\\n\\nIn the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of\\nstate in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry,\\nthe tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried\\nthrough the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in\\nthe roof, the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of\\nhollow to the great iron ring. All being made ready with much labour,\\nand the hour come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and\\nthe sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring\\nwas put into his hand, and he struck with it, and the rope parted and\\nrushed away, and the ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, near\\nand afar, that tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an\\ninstant the blow was struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon\\nme.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXXIX.\\n\\n\\nI was three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard to\\nenlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third\\nbirthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard’s Inn more than a year,\\nand lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the\\nriver.\\n\\nMr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original\\nrelations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my\\ninability to settle to anything,—which I hope arose out of the restless\\nand incomplete tenure on which I held my means,—I had a taste for\\nreading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter of\\nHerbert’s was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have\\nbrought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.\\n\\nBusiness had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, and\\nhad a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hoping\\nthat to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed,\\nI sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.\\n\\nIt was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud,\\nmud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been\\ndriving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the\\nEast there were an eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been the\\ngusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their\\nroofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of\\nwindmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast,\\nof shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these\\nrages of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been\\nthe worst of all.\\n\\nAlterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time,\\nand it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so\\nexposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the\\nwind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges\\nof cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed\\nagainst the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they rocked,\\nthat I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.\\nOccasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it\\ncould not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors\\nopen and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out;\\nand when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black\\nwindows (opening them ever so little was out of the question in the\\nteeth of such wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court were\\nblown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were\\nshuddering, and that the coal-fires in barges on the river were being\\ncarried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.\\n\\nI read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book at\\neleven o’clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul’s, and all the many\\nchurch-clocks in the City—some leading, some accompanying, some\\nfollowing—struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind;\\nand I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it,\\nwhen I heard a footstep on the stair.\\n\\nWhat nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the\\nfootstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I\\nlistened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.\\nRemembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up\\nmy reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below had\\nstopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.\\n\\n“There is some one down there, is there not?” I called out, looking\\ndown.\\n\\n“Yes,” said a voice from the darkness beneath.\\n\\n“What floor do you want?”\\n\\n“The top. Mr. Pip.”\\n\\n“That is my name.—There is nothing the matter?”\\n\\n“Nothing the matter,” returned the voice. And the man came on.\\n\\nI stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came slowly\\nwithin its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its\\ncircle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mere\\ninstant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was\\nstrange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched\\nand pleased by the sight of me.\\n\\nMoving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially\\ndressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron-grey\\nhair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong\\non his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to\\nweather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp\\nincluded us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was\\nholding out both his hands to me.\\n\\n“Pray what is your business?” I asked him.\\n\\n“My business?” he repeated, pausing. “Ah! Yes. I will explain my\\nbusiness, by your leave.”\\n\\n“Do you wish to come in?”\\n\\n“Yes,” he replied; “I wish to come in, master.”\\n\\nI had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the\\nsort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.\\nI resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to\\nrespond to it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and,\\nhaving set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to\\nexplain himself.\\n\\nHe looked about him with the strangest air,—an air of wondering\\npleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired,—and he\\npulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his head\\nwas furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-grey hair grew only on\\nits sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On the\\ncontrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands\\nto me.\\n\\n“What do you mean?” said I, half suspecting him to be mad.\\n\\nHe stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand over\\nhis head. “It’s disapinting to a man,” he said, in a coarse broken\\nvoice, “arter having looked for’ard so distant, and come so fur; but\\nyou’re not to blame for that,—neither on us is to blame for that. I’ll\\nspeak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.”\\n\\nHe sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his\\nforehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at him\\nattentively then, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know\\nhim.\\n\\n“There’s no one nigh,” said he, looking over his shoulder; “is there?”\\n\\n“Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night,\\nask that question?” said I.\\n\\n“You’re a game one,” he returned, shaking his head at me with a\\ndeliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most\\nexasperating; “I’m glad you’ve grow’d up, a game one! But don’t catch\\nhold of me. You’d be sorry arterwards to have done it.”\\n\\nI relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him! Even yet\\nI could not recall a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind and\\nthe rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the\\nintervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first\\nstood face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my\\nconvict more distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair\\nbefore the fire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to\\nme; no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round\\nhis head; no need to hug himself with both his arms, and take a\\nshivering turn across the room, looking back at me for recognition. I\\nknew him before he gave me one of those aids, though, a moment before,\\nI had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity.\\n\\nHe came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands. Not\\nknowing what to do,—for, in my astonishment I had lost my\\nself-possession,—I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped them\\nheartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.\\n\\n“You acted noble, my boy,” said he. “Noble, Pip! And I have never\\nforgot it!”\\n\\nAt a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me, I\\nlaid a hand upon his breast and put him away.\\n\\n“Stay!” said I. “Keep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did\\nwhen I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by\\nmending your way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was not\\nnecessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must be\\nsomething good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not\\nrepulse you; but surely you must understand that—I—”\\n\\nMy attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at\\nme, that the words died away on my tongue.\\n\\n“You was a-saying,” he observed, when we had confronted one another in\\nsilence, “that surely I must understand. What, surely must I\\nunderstand?”\\n\\n“That I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long\\nago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you have\\nrepented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I am glad\\nthat, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. But\\nour ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look\\nweary. Will you drink something before you go?”\\n\\nHe had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly\\nobservant of me, biting a long end of it. “I think,” he answered, still\\nwith the end at his mouth and still observant of me, “that I _will_\\ndrink (I thank you) afore I go.”\\n\\nThere was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table near\\nthe fire, and asked him what he would have? He touched one of the\\nbottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rum\\nand water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his look\\nat me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his\\nneckerchief between his teeth—evidently forgotten—made my hand very\\ndifficult to master. When at last I put the glass to him, I saw with\\namazement that his eyes were full of tears.\\n\\nUp to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished\\nhim gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and\\nfelt a touch of reproach. “I hope,” said I, hurriedly putting something\\ninto a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, “that you\\nwill not think I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention of\\ndoing it, and I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well and happy!”\\n\\nAs I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end of\\nhis neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and\\nstretched out his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew\\nhis sleeve across his eyes and forehead.\\n\\n“How are you living?” I asked him.\\n\\n“I’ve been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away in\\nthe new world,” said he; “many a thousand mile of stormy water off from\\nthis.”\\n\\n“I hope you have done well?”\\n\\n“I’ve done wonderfully well. There’s others went out alonger me as has\\ndone well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. I’m famous for\\nit.”\\n\\n“I am glad to hear it.”\\n\\n“I hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.”\\n\\nWithout stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which\\nthey were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my\\nmind.\\n\\n“Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,” I inquired,\\n“since he undertook that trust?”\\n\\n“Never set eyes upon him. I warn’t likely to it.”\\n\\n“He came faithfully, and he brought me the two one-pound notes. I was a\\npoor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a little\\nfortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay\\nthem back. You can put them to some other poor boy’s use.” I took out\\nmy purse.\\n\\nHe watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he\\nwatched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents. They\\nwere clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to him.\\nStill watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded them\\nlong-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped\\nthe ashes into the tray.\\n\\n“May I make so bold,” he said then, with a smile that was like a frown,\\nand with a frown that was like a smile, “as ask you _how_ you have done\\nwell, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“Ah!”\\n\\nHe emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with\\nhis heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf. He put a foot up to the bars,\\nto dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he neither\\nlooked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was only\\nnow that I began to tremble.\\n\\nWhen my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were without\\nsound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do it\\ndistinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.\\n\\n“Might a mere warmint ask what property?” said he.\\n\\nI faltered, “I don’t know.”\\n\\n“Might a mere warmint ask whose property?” said he.\\n\\nI faltered again, “I don’t know.”\\n\\n“Could I make a guess, I wonder,” said the Convict, “at your income\\nsince you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?”\\n\\nWith my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose\\nout of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking\\nwildly at him.\\n\\n“Concerning a guardian,” he went on. “There ought to have been some\\nguardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. As\\nto the first letter of that lawyer’s name now. Would it be J?”\\n\\nAll the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its\\ndisappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed\\nin in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to\\nstruggle for every breath I drew.\\n\\n“Put it,” he resumed, “as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun\\nwith a J, and might be Jaggers,—put it as he had come over sea to\\nPortsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come on to you.\\n‘However, you have found me out,’ you says just now. Well! However, did\\nI find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London, for\\nparticulars of your address. That person’s name? Why, Wemmick.”\\n\\nI could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life. I\\nstood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where I\\nseemed to be suffocating,—I stood so, looking wildly at him, until I\\ngrasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. He caught\\nme, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on\\none knee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, and\\nthat I shuddered at, very near to mine.\\n\\n“Yes, Pip, dear boy, I’ve made a gentleman on you! It’s me wot has done\\nit! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea\\nshould go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec’lated and got\\nrich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth;\\nI worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear boy? Do I\\ntell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you to\\nknow as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got his\\nhead so high that he could make a gentleman,—and, Pip, you’re him!”\\n\\nThe abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the\\nrepugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded\\nif he had been some terrible beast.\\n\\n“Look’ee here, Pip. I’m your second father. You’re my son,—more to me\\nnor any son. I’ve put away money, only for you to spend. When I was a\\nhired-out shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces of\\nsheep till I half forgot wot men’s and women’s faces wos like, I see\\nyourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating my\\ndinner or my supper, and I says, ‘Here’s the boy again, a looking at me\\nwhiles I eats and drinks!’ I see you there a many times, as plain as\\never I see you on them misty marshes. ‘Lord strike me dead!’ I says\\neach time,—and I goes out in the air to say it under the open\\nheavens,—‘but wot, if I gets liberty and money, I’ll make that boy a\\ngentleman!’ And I done it. Why, look at you, dear boy! Look at these\\nhere lodgings of yourn, fit for a lord! A lord? Ah! You shall show\\nmoney with lords for wagers, and beat ’em!”\\n\\nIn his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been nearly\\nfainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the one\\ngrain of relief I had.\\n\\n“Look’ee here!” he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and\\nturning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his\\ntouch as if he had been a snake, “a gold ’un and a beauty: _that’s_ a\\ngentleman’s, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies; _that’s_ a\\ngentleman’s, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look at\\nyour clothes; better ain’t to be got! And your books too,” turning his\\neyes round the room, “mounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! And\\nyou read ’em; don’t you? I see you’d been a reading of ’em when I come\\nin. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read ’em to me, dear boy! And if they’re in\\nforeign languages wot I don’t understand, I shall be just as proud as\\nif I did.”\\n\\nAgain he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my blood\\nran cold within me.\\n\\n“Don’t you mind talking, Pip,” said he, after again drawing his sleeve\\nover his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I\\nwell remembered,—and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so\\nmuch in earnest; “you can’t do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. You\\nain’t looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn’t prepared for\\nthis as I wos. But didn’t you never think it might be me?”\\n\\n“O no, no, no,” I returned, “Never, never!”\\n\\n“Well, you see it _wos_ me, and single-handed. Never a soul in it but\\nmy own self and Mr. Jaggers.”\\n\\n“Was there no one else?” I asked.\\n\\n“No,” said he, with a glance of surprise: “who else should there be?\\nAnd, dear boy, how good looking you have growed! There’s bright eyes\\nsomewheres—eh? Isn’t there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the\\nthoughts on?”\\n\\nO Estella, Estella!\\n\\n“They shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy ’em. Not that a\\ngentleman like you, so well set up as you, can’t win ’em off of his own\\ngame; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you,\\ndear boy. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money\\nleft me by my master (which died, and had been the same as me), and got\\nmy liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I\\nwent for you. ‘Lord strike a blight upon it,’ I says, wotever it was I\\nwent for, ‘if it ain’t for him!’ It all prospered wonderful. As I giv’\\nyou to understand just now, I’m famous for it. It was the money left\\nme, and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr.\\nJaggers—all for you—when he first come arter you, agreeable to my\\nletter.”\\n\\nO that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge,—far from\\ncontented, yet, by comparison happy!\\n\\n“And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look’ee here, to know\\nin secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them\\ncolonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I\\nsay? I says to myself, ‘I’m making a better gentleman nor ever _you_’ll\\nbe!’ When one of ’em says to another, ‘He was a convict, a few year\\nago, and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all he’s lucky,’ what do\\nI say? I says to myself, ‘If I ain’t a gentleman, nor yet ain’t got no\\nlearning, I’m the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which\\non you owns a brought-up London gentleman?’ This way I kep myself\\na-going. And this way I held steady afore my mind that I would for\\ncertain come one day and see my boy, and make myself known to him, on\\nhis own ground.”\\n\\nHe laid his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for\\nanything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.\\n\\n“It warn’t easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn’t\\nsafe. But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for\\nI was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear\\nboy, I done it!”\\n\\nI tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had\\nseemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him;\\neven now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, though\\nthose were loud and his was silent.\\n\\n“Where will you put me?” he asked, presently. “I must be put\\nsomewheres, dear boy.”\\n\\n“To sleep?” said I.\\n\\n“Yes. And to sleep long and sound,” he answered; “for I’ve been\\nsea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.”\\n\\n“My friend and companion,” said I, rising from the sofa, “is absent;\\nyou must have his room.”\\n\\n“He won’t come back to-morrow; will he?”\\n\\n“No,” said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost\\nefforts; “not to-morrow.”\\n\\n“Because, look’ee here, dear boy,” he said, dropping his voice, and\\nlaying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, “caution is\\nnecessary.”\\n\\n“How do you mean? Caution?”\\n\\n“By G——, it’s Death!”\\n\\n“What’s death?”\\n\\n“I was sent for life. It’s death to come back. There’s been overmuch\\ncoming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if\\ntook.”\\n\\nNothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading wretched\\nme with his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his life to\\ncome to me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved him\\ninstead of abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by the\\nstrongest admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him with\\nthe strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary,\\nit would have been better, for his preservation would then have\\nnaturally and tenderly addressed my heart.\\n\\nMy first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen\\nfrom without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did\\nso, he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I\\nsaw him thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal\\nagain. It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, to\\nfile at his leg.\\n\\nWhen I had gone into Herbert’s room, and had shut off any other\\ncommunication between it and the staircase than through the room in\\nwhich our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to\\nbed? He said yes, but asked me for some of my “gentleman’s linen” to\\nput on in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, and\\nmy blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me\\ngood-night.\\n\\nI got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire\\nin the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to\\ngo to bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it\\nwas not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked\\nI was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.\\n\\nMiss Havisham’s intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not\\ndesigned for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a\\nsting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to\\npractise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first\\nsmarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,—it was for the\\nconvict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out\\nof those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door,\\nthat I had deserted Joe.\\n\\nI would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to\\nBiddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my sense\\nof my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every\\nconsideration. No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that\\nI should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could\\nnever, never, undo what I had done.\\n\\nIn every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, I\\ncould have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door.\\nWith these fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I\\nhad had mysterious warnings of this man’s approach. That, for weeks\\ngone by, I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like\\nhis. That these likenesses had grown more numerous, as he, coming over\\nthe sea, had drawn nearer. That his wicked spirit had somehow sent\\nthese messengers to mine, and that now on this stormy night he was as\\ngood as his word, and with me.\\n\\nCrowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen\\nhim with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I had\\nheard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him;\\nthat I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild\\nbeast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a\\nhalf-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with\\nhim in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until it\\nfilled the room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at\\nmy dreadful burden.\\n\\nHe had rolled a handkerchief round his head, and his face was set and\\nlowering in his sleep. But he was asleep, and quietly too, though he\\nhad a pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed the\\nkey to the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again sat\\ndown by the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the\\nfloor. When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the\\nperception of my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were\\nstriking five, the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the\\nwind and rain intensified the thick black darkness.\\n\\nTHIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP’S EXPECTATIONS.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XL.\\n\\n\\nIt was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so\\nfar as I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought\\npressing on me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused\\nconcourse at a distance.\\n\\nThe impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was\\nself-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would\\ninevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service\\nnow, but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by\\nan animated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a room\\nsecret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They\\nboth had weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically\\nlooking in at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted;\\nindeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to get\\nup a mystery with these people, I resolved to announce in the morning\\nthat my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country.\\n\\nThis course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness\\nfor the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all,\\nI was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there\\nto come with his lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black\\nstaircase I fell over something, and that something was a man crouching\\nin a corner.\\n\\nAs the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but\\neluded my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman\\nto come quickly; telling him of the incident on the way back. The wind\\nbeing as fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the\\nlantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we\\nexamined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one\\nthere. It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have\\nslipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman’s, and\\nleaving him standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including\\nthe room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and\\nassuredly no other man was in those chambers.\\n\\nIt troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on\\nthat night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the\\nchance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at\\nthe door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had\\nperceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times of the\\nnight, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in\\nthe Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man\\nwho dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in\\nthe country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the\\nnight, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came\\nupstairs.\\n\\n“The night being so bad, sir,” said the watchman, as he gave me back my\\nglass, “uncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them three\\ngentlemen that I have named, I don’t call to mind another since about\\neleven o’clock, when a stranger asked for you.”\\n\\n“My uncle,” I muttered. “Yes.”\\n\\n“You saw him, sir?”\\n\\n“Yes. Oh yes.”\\n\\n“Likewise the person with him?”\\n\\n“Person with him!” I repeated.\\n\\n“I judged the person to be with him,” returned the watchman. “The\\nperson stopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person\\ntook this way when he took this way.”\\n\\n“What sort of person?”\\n\\nThe watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working\\nperson; to the best of his belief, he had a dust-coloured kind of\\nclothes on, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of the\\nmatter than I did, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching\\nweight to it.\\n\\nWhen I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without\\nprolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two\\ncircumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent\\nsolution apart,—as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home, who\\nhad not gone near this watchman’s gate, might have strayed to my\\nstaircase and dropped asleep there,—and my nameless visitor might have\\nbrought some one with him to show him the way,—still, joined, they had\\nan ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a\\nfew hours had made me.\\n\\nI lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of\\nthe morning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been\\ndozing a whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an\\nhour and a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up\\nuneasily, with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now,\\nmaking thunder of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into\\na profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start.\\n\\nAll this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor\\ncould I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly\\ndejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way. As\\nto forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an\\nelephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild\\nmorning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I\\nsat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to\\nappear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long\\nI had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or\\neven who I was that made it.\\n\\nAt last, the old woman and the niece came in,—the latter with a head\\nnot easily distinguishable from her dusty broom,—and testified surprise\\nat sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my uncle had come\\nin the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations\\nwere to be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while they\\nknocked the furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream\\nor sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting\\nfor—Him—to come to breakfast.\\n\\nBy and by, his door opened and he came out. I could not bring myself to\\nbear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by daylight.\\n\\n“I do not even know,” said I, speaking low as he took his seat at the\\ntable, “by what name to call you. I have given out that you are my\\nuncle.”\\n\\n“That’s it, dear boy! Call me uncle.”\\n\\n“You assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?”\\n\\n“Yes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis.”\\n\\n“Do you mean to keep that name?”\\n\\n“Why, yes, dear boy, it’s as good as another,—unless you’d like\\nanother.”\\n\\n“What is your real name?” I asked him in a whisper.\\n\\n“Magwitch,” he answered, in the same tone; “chrisen’d Abel.”\\n\\n“What were you brought up to be?”\\n\\n“A warmint, dear boy.”\\n\\nHe answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some\\nprofession.\\n\\n“When you came into the Temple last night—” said I, pausing to wonder\\nwhether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long\\nago.\\n\\n“Yes, dear boy?”\\n\\n“When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had\\nyou any one with you?”\\n\\n“With me? No, dear boy.”\\n\\n“But there was some one there?”\\n\\n“I didn’t take particular notice,” he said, dubiously, “not knowing the\\nways of the place. But I think there _was_ a person, too, come in\\nalonger me.”\\n\\n“Are you known in London?”\\n\\n“I hope not!” said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that\\nmade me turn hot and sick.\\n\\n“Were you known in London, once?”\\n\\n“Not over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly.”\\n\\n“Were you—tried—in London?”\\n\\n“Which time?” said he, with a sharp look.\\n\\n“The last time.”\\n\\nHe nodded. “First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me.”\\n\\nIt was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up a\\nknife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, “And what I done is\\nworked out and paid for!” fell to at his breakfast.\\n\\nHe ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his\\nactions were uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his teeth had failed\\nhim since I saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food in\\nhis mouth, and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to\\nbear upon it, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begun\\nwith any appetite, he would have taken it away, and I should have sat\\nmuch as I did,—repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion, and\\ngloomily looking at the cloth.\\n\\n“I’m a heavy grubber, dear boy,” he said, as a polite kind of apology\\nwhen he made an end of his meal, “but I always was. If it had been in\\nmy constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha’ got into lighter\\ntrouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as\\nshepherd t’other side the world, it’s my belief I should ha’ turned\\ninto a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn’t a had my smoke.”\\n\\nAs he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the\\nbreast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a\\nhandful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head. Having\\nfilled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his\\npocket were a drawer. Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the\\ntongs, and lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the\\nhearth-rug with his back to the fire, and went through his favourite\\naction of holding out both his hands for mine.\\n\\n“And this,” said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed\\nat his pipe,—“and this is the gentleman what I made! The real genuine\\nOne! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip’late, is, to\\nstand by and look at you, dear boy!”\\n\\nI released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning\\nslowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was\\nchained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his\\nhoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its\\niron grey hair at the sides.\\n\\n“I mustn’t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;\\nthere mustn’t be no mud on _his_ boots. My gentleman must have horses,\\nPip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant to\\nride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses (and blood\\n’uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman? No, no.\\nWe’ll show ’em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won’t us?”\\n\\nHe took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with\\npapers, and tossed it on the table.\\n\\n“There’s something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It’s\\nyourn. All I’ve got ain’t mine; it’s yourn. Don’t you be afeerd on it.\\nThere’s more where that come from. I’ve come to the old country fur to\\nsee my gentleman spend his money _like_ a gentleman. That’ll be _my_\\npleasure. _My_ pleasure ’ull be fur to see him do it. And blast you\\nall!” he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once\\nwith a loud snap, “blast you every one, from the judge in his wig, to\\nthe colonist a stirring up the dust, I’ll show a better gentleman than\\nthe whole kit on you put together!”\\n\\n“Stop!” said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, “I want to\\nspeak to you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how you\\nare to be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what\\nprojects you have.”\\n\\n“Look’ee here, Pip,” said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly\\naltered and subdued manner; “first of all, look’ee here. I forgot\\nmyself half a minute ago. What I said was low; that’s what it was; low.\\nLook’ee here, Pip. Look over it. I ain’t a-going to be low.”\\n\\n“First,” I resumed, half groaning, “what precautions can be taken\\nagainst your being recognised and seized?”\\n\\n“No, dear boy,” he said, in the same tone as before, “that don’t go\\nfirst. Lowness goes first. I ain’t took so many year to make a\\ngentleman, not without knowing what’s due to him. Look’ee here, Pip. I\\nwas low; that’s what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy.”\\n\\nSome sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I\\nreplied, “I _have_ looked over it. In Heaven’s name, don’t harp upon\\nit!”\\n\\n“Yes, but look’ee here,” he persisted. “Dear boy, I ain’t come so fur,\\nnot fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying—”\\n\\n“How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?”\\n\\n“Well, dear boy, the danger ain’t so great. Without I was informed\\nagen, the danger ain’t so much to signify. There’s Jaggers, and there’s\\nWemmick, and there’s you. Who else is there to inform?”\\n\\n“Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?” said\\nI.\\n\\n“Well,” he returned, “there ain’t many. Nor yet I don’t intend to\\nadvertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from\\nBotany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who’s to gain by it? Still,\\nlook’ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I\\nshould ha’ come to see you, mind you, just the same.”\\n\\n“And how long do you remain?”\\n\\n“How long?” said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping\\nhis jaw as he stared at me. “I’m not a-going back. I’ve come for good.”\\n\\n“Where are you to live?” said I. “What is to be done with you? Where\\nwill you be safe?”\\n\\n“Dear boy,” he returned, “there’s disguising wigs can be bought for\\nmoney, and there’s hair powder, and spectacles, and black\\nclothes,—shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what\\nothers has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of\\nliving, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.”\\n\\n“You take it smoothly now,” said I, “but you were very serious last\\nnight, when you swore it was Death.”\\n\\n“And so I swear it is Death,” said he, putting his pipe back in his\\nmouth, “and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this,\\nand it’s serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What\\nthen, when that’s once done? Here I am. To go back now ’ud be as bad as\\nto stand ground—worse. Besides, Pip, I’m here, because I’ve meant it by\\nyou, years and years. As to what I dare, I’m a old bird now, as has\\ndared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I’m not\\nafeerd to perch upon a scarecrow. If there’s Death hid inside of it,\\nthere is, and let him come out, and I’ll face him, and then I’ll\\nbelieve in him and not afore. And now let me have a look at my\\ngentleman agen.”\\n\\nOnce more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of\\nadmiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.\\n\\nIt appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quiet\\nlodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert\\nreturned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must be\\nconfided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I\\ncould have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with\\nhim out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so\\nplain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved\\nhis consent to Herbert’s participation until he should have seen him\\nand formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy. “And even then,\\ndear boy,” said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out\\nof his pocket, “we’ll have him on his oath.”\\n\\nTo state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about\\nthe world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to\\nstate what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never\\nknew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of\\nhaving been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his\\nknowledge of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that\\nwise, gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or\\ncharm. On this first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he\\nhad made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had\\ndescribed himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in\\nhis solitude.\\n\\nAs he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he\\nlooked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next\\ndiscussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an\\nextraordinary belief in the virtues of “shorts” as a disguise, and had\\nin his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him\\nsomething between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable\\ndifficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a\\nprosperous farmer’s; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,\\nand wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the\\nlaundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until\\nhis change of dress was made.\\n\\nIt would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my\\ndazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not\\nget out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to\\nremain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account\\nto open the door.\\n\\nThere being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex\\nStreet, the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within\\nhail of my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so\\nfortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis. I\\nthen went from shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to\\nthe change in his appearance. This business transacted, I turned my\\nface, on my own account, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at his\\ndesk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and stood before his\\nfire.\\n\\n“Now, Pip,” said he, “be careful.”\\n\\n“I will, sir,” I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what\\nI was going to say.\\n\\n“Don’t commit yourself,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and don’t commit any one.\\nYou understand—any one. Don’t tell me anything: I don’t want to know\\nanything; I am not curious.”\\n\\nOf course I saw that he knew the man was come.\\n\\n“I merely want, Mr. Jaggers,” said I, “to assure myself that what I\\nhave been told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at\\nleast I may verify it.”\\n\\nMr. Jaggers nodded. “But did you say ‘told’ or ‘informed’?” he asked\\nme, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in a\\nlistening way at the floor. “Told would seem to imply verbal\\ncommunication. You can’t have verbal communication with a man in New\\nSouth Wales, you know.”\\n\\n“I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.”\\n\\n“Good.”\\n\\n“I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the\\nbenefactor so long unknown to me.”\\n\\n“That is the man,” said Mr. Jaggers, “in New South Wales.”\\n\\n“And only he?” said I.\\n\\n“And only he,” said Mr. Jaggers.\\n\\n“I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for\\nmy mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss\\nHavisham.”\\n\\n“As you say, Pip,” returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon me\\ncoolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, “I am not at all\\nresponsible for that.”\\n\\n“And yet it looked so like it, sir,” I pleaded with a downcast heart.\\n\\n“Not a particle of evidence, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his head\\nand gathering up his skirts. “Take nothing on its looks; take\\neverything on evidence. There’s no better rule.”\\n\\n“I have no more to say,” said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for\\na little while. “I have verified my information, and there’s an end.”\\n\\n“And Magwitch—in New South Wales—having at last disclosed himself,”\\nsaid Mr. Jaggers, “you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout my\\ncommunication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of\\nfact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of\\nfact. You are quite aware of that?”\\n\\n“Quite, sir.”\\n\\n“I communicated to Magwitch—in New South Wales—when he first wrote to\\nme—from New South Wales—the caution that he must not expect me ever to\\ndeviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to him\\nanother caution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his\\nletter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. I\\ncautioned him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all\\nlikely to obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his\\nnatural life; and that his presenting himself in this country would be\\nan act of felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the\\nlaw. I gave Magwitch that caution,” said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at\\nme; “I wrote it to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt.”\\n\\n“No doubt,” said I.\\n\\n“I have been informed by Wemmick,” pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking\\nhard at me, “that he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from\\na colonist of the name of Purvis, or—”\\n\\n“Or Provis,” I suggested.\\n\\n“Or Provis—thank you, Pip. Perhaps it _is_ Provis? Perhaps you know\\nit’s Provis?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said I.\\n\\n“You know it’s Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist\\nof the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on\\nbehalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by\\nreturn of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received\\nthe explanation of Magwitch—in New South Wales?”\\n\\n“It came through Provis,” I replied.\\n\\n“Good day, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; “glad to have\\nseen you. In writing by post to Magwitch—in New South Wales—or in\\ncommunicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention\\nthat the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to\\nyou, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining.\\nGood-day, Pip!”\\n\\nWe shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. I\\nturned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two\\nvile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,\\nand to force out of their swollen throats, “O, what a man he is!”\\n\\nWemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done\\nnothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found the\\nterrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in\\nsafety.\\n\\nNext day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.\\nWhatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to me) than\\nwhat he had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in him\\nthat made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him. The more I dressed\\nhim and the better I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching\\nfugitive on the marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly\\nreferable, no doubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiar\\nto me; but I believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there\\nwere still a weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was\\nConvict in the very grain of the man.\\n\\nThe influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and gave\\nhim a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the\\ninfluences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,\\nhis consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now. In all his ways\\nof sitting and standing, and eating and drinking,—of brooding about in\\na high-shouldered reluctant style,—of taking out his great horn-handled\\njackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,—of lifting\\nlight glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsy\\npannikins,—of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with it\\nthe last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to make\\nthe most of an allowance, and then drying his finger-ends on it, and\\nthen swallowing it,—in these ways and a thousand other small nameless\\ninstances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,\\nBondsman, plain as plain could be.\\n\\nIt had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had\\nconceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare the\\neffect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon\\nthe dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it\\nwas most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of\\npretence, and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head. It\\nwas abandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cut\\nshort.\\n\\nWords cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful\\nmystery that he was to me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with his\\nknotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald head\\ntattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit\\nand look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all\\nthe crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to\\nstart up and fly from him. Every hour so increased my abhorrence of\\nhim, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the\\nfirst agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for\\nme and the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon\\ncome back. Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and\\nbegin to dress myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave\\nhim there with everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a\\nprivate soldier.\\n\\nI doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those\\nlonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and\\nthe rain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and\\nhanged on my account, and the consideration that he could be, and the\\ndread that he would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When he\\nwas not asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged\\npack of cards of his own,—a game that I never saw before or since, and\\nin which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the\\ntable,—when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he would\\nask me to read to him,—“Foreign language, dear boy!” While I complied,\\nhe, not comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire\\nsurveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, between\\nthe fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb\\nshow to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary\\nstudent pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, was\\nnot more wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and\\nrecoiling from him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired me\\nand the fonder he was of me.\\n\\nThis is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It\\nlasted about five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go\\nout, except when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one\\nevening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite\\nworn out,—for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful\\ndreams,—I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis,\\nwho had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an\\ninstant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand.\\n\\n“Quiet! It’s Herbert!” I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with the\\nairy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him.\\n\\n“Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again\\nhow are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I must\\nhave been, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my—Halloa! I\\nbeg your pardon.”\\n\\nHe was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, by\\nseeing Provis. Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowly\\nputting up his jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something\\nelse.\\n\\n“Herbert, my dear friend,” said I, shutting the double doors, while\\nHerbert stood staring and wondering, “something very strange has\\nhappened. This is—a visitor of mine.”\\n\\n“It’s all right, dear boy!” said Provis coming forward, with his little\\nclasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert. “Take it in\\nyour right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in\\nany way sumever! Kiss it!”\\n\\n“Do so, as he wishes it,” I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at me\\nwith a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis\\nimmediately shaking hands with him, said, “Now you’re on your oath, you\\nknow. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan’t make a gentleman on\\nyou!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XLI.\\n\\n\\nIn vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of\\nHerbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I\\nrecounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings\\nreflected in Herbert’s face, and not least among them, my repugnance\\ntowards the man who had done so much for me.\\n\\nWhat would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there\\nhad been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.\\nSaving his troublesome sense of having been “low” on one occasion since\\nhis return,—on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the\\nmoment my revelation was finished,—he had no perception of the\\npossibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boast\\nthat he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support\\nthe character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as\\nfor himself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,\\nand that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite\\nestablished in his own mind.\\n\\n“Though, look’ee here, Pip’s comrade,” he said to Herbert, after having\\ndiscoursed for some time, “I know very well that once since I come\\nback—for half a minute—I’ve been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I had\\nbeen low. But don’t you fret yourself on that score. I ain’t made Pip a\\ngentleman, and Pip ain’t a-going to make you a gentleman, not fur me\\nnot to know what’s due to ye both. Dear boy, and Pip’s comrade, you two\\nmay count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on. Muzzled I have\\nbeen since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled\\nI am at the present time, muzzled I ever will be.”\\n\\nHerbert said, “Certainly,” but looked as if there were no specific\\nconsolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were\\nanxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us\\ntogether, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat\\nlate. It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street, and saw\\nhim safely in at his own dark door. When it closed upon him, I\\nexperienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of\\nhis arrival.\\n\\nNever quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs, I\\nhad always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in\\nbringing him back; and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in a\\nlarge city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is\\nconscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that\\nany of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who\\nwere passing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty\\nwhen I turned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate\\nwith us, nobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the\\nfountain, I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and,\\nwhen I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I\\nlived, before going up the stairs, Garden Court was as still and\\nlifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it.\\n\\nHerbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so\\nblessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some sound\\nwords of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the\\nquestion, What was to be done?\\n\\nThe chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had\\nstood,—for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in\\none unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with\\nhis pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,\\nand what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,—I say his\\nchair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but\\nnext moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He had\\nno occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my\\npatron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that\\nconfidence without shaping a syllable.\\n\\n“What,” said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,—“what is\\nto be done?”\\n\\n“My poor dear Handel,” he replied, holding his head, “I am too stunned\\nto think.”\\n\\n“So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be\\ndone. He is intent upon various new expenses,—horses, and carriages,\\nand lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow.”\\n\\n“You mean that you can’t accept—”\\n\\n“How can I?” I interposed, as Herbert paused. “Think of him! Look at\\nhim!”\\n\\nAn involuntary shudder passed over both of us.\\n\\n“Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to\\nme, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!”\\n\\n“My poor dear Handel,” Herbert repeated.\\n\\n“Then,” said I, “after all, stopping short here, never taking another\\npenny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavily\\nin debt,—very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,—and I have\\nbeen bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.”\\n\\n“Well, well, well!” Herbert remonstrated. “Don’t say fit for nothing.”\\n\\n“What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that\\nis, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but\\nfor the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.”\\n\\nOf course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a\\nwarm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.\\n\\n“Anyhow, my dear Handel,” said he presently, “soldiering won’t do. If\\nyou were to renounce this patronage and these favours, I suppose you\\nwould do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have\\nalready had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!\\nBesides, it’s absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker’s\\nhouse, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you\\nknow.”\\n\\nPoor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.\\n\\n“But there is another question,” said Herbert. “This is an ignorant,\\ndetermined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he\\nseems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fierce\\ncharacter.”\\n\\n“I know he is,” I returned. “Let me tell you what evidence I have seen\\nof it.” And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of\\nthat encounter with the other convict.\\n\\n“See, then,” said Herbert; “think of this! He comes here at the peril\\nof his life, for the realisation of his fixed idea. In the moment of\\nrealisation, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from\\nunder his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.\\nDo you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?”\\n\\n“I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night\\nof his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his\\nputting himself in the way of being taken.”\\n\\n“Then you may rely upon it,” said Herbert, “that there would be great\\ndanger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he\\nremains in England, and that would be his reckless course if you\\nforsook him.”\\n\\nI was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon me\\nfrom the first, and the working out of which would make me regard\\nmyself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in my\\nchair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that\\neven if Provis were recognised and taken, in spite of himself, I should\\nbe wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was so\\nwretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I would\\nfar rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I\\nwould ever have come to this!\\n\\nBut there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?\\n\\n“The first and the main thing to be done,” said Herbert, “is to get him\\nout of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may be\\ninduced to go.”\\n\\n“But get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?”\\n\\n“My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next\\nstreet, there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to\\nhim and making him reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to get\\nhim away could be made out of that other convict, or out of anything\\nelse in his life, now.”\\n\\n“There, again!” said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands\\nheld out, as if they contained the desperation of the case. “I know\\nnothing of his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night\\nand see him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes,\\nand yet so unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified\\nme two days in my childhood!”\\n\\nHerbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and\\nfro together, studying the carpet.\\n\\n“Handel,” said Herbert, stopping, “you feel convinced that you can take\\nno further benefits from him; do you?”\\n\\n“Fully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?”\\n\\n“And you feel convinced that you must break with him?”\\n\\n“Herbert, can you ask me?”\\n\\n“And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he\\nhas risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, from\\nthrowing it away. Then you must get him out of England before you stir\\na finger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in\\nHeaven’s name, and we’ll see it out together, dear old boy.”\\n\\nIt was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,\\nwith only that done.\\n\\n“Now, Herbert,” said I, “with reference to gaining some knowledge of\\nhis history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask him point\\nblank.”\\n\\n“Yes. Ask him,” said Herbert, “when we sit at breakfast in the\\nmorning.” For he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he would\\ncome to breakfast with us.\\n\\nWith this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreams\\nconcerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear\\nwhich I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returned\\ntransport. Waking, I never lost that fear.\\n\\nHe came round at the appointed time, took out his jackknife, and sat\\ndown to his meal. He was full of plans “for his gentleman’s coming out\\nstrong, and like a gentleman,” and urged me to begin speedily upon the\\npocket-book which he had left in my possession. He considered the\\nchambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to\\nlook out at once for a “fashionable crib” near Hyde Park, in which he\\ncould have “a shake-down.” When he had made an end of his breakfast,\\nand was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word of\\npreface,—\\n\\n“After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that\\nthe soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. You\\nremember?”\\n\\n“Remember!” said he. “I think so!”\\n\\n“We want to know something about that man—and about you. It is strange\\nto know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to\\ntell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing\\nmore?”\\n\\n“Well!” he said, after consideration. “You’re on your oath, you know,\\nPip’s comrade?”\\n\\n“Assuredly,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“As to anything I say, you know,” he insisted. “The oath applies to\\nall.”\\n\\n“I understand it to do so.”\\n\\n“And look’ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for,” he\\ninsisted again.\\n\\n“So be it.”\\n\\nHe took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head,\\nwhen, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think\\nit might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back again,\\nstuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on each\\nknee, and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent\\nmoments, looked round at us and said what follows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XLII.\\n\\n\\n“Dear boy and Pip’s comrade. I am not a-going fur to tell you my life\\nlike a song, or a story-book. But to give it you short and handy, I’ll\\nput it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in\\njail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you’ve got it.\\nThat’s _my_ life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,\\narter Pip stood my friend.\\n\\n“I’ve been done everything to, pretty well—except hanged. I’ve been\\nlocked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I’ve been carted here and\\ncarted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and\\nstuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I’ve no more\\nnotion where I was born than you have—if so much. I first become aware\\nof myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had\\nrun away from me—a man—a tinker—and he’d took the fire with him, and\\nleft me wery cold.\\n\\n“I know’d my name to be Magwitch, chrisen’d Abel. How did I know it?\\nMuch as I know’d the birds’ names in the hedges to be chaffinch,\\nsparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as\\nthe birds’ names come out true, I supposed mine did.\\n\\n“So fur as I could find, there warn’t a soul that see young Abel\\nMagwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at\\nhim, and either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up,\\ntook up, to that extent that I reg’larly grow’d up took up.\\n\\n“This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as\\nmuch to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for\\nthere warn’t many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the\\nname of being hardened. ‘This is a terrible hardened one,’ they says to\\nprison wisitors, picking out me. ‘May be said to live in jails, this\\nboy.’ Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured\\nmy head, some on ’em,—they had better a measured my stomach,—and others\\non ’em giv me tracts what I couldn’t read, and made me speeches what I\\ncouldn’t understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But\\nwhat the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach,\\nmustn’t I?—Howsomever, I’m a getting low, and I know what’s due. Dear\\nboy and Pip’s comrade, don’t you be afeerd of me being low.\\n\\n“Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,—though\\nthat warn’t as often as you may think, till you put the question\\nwhether you would ha’ been over-ready to give me work yourselves,—a bit\\nof a poacher, a bit of a labourer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a\\nhaymaker, a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don’t pay and\\nlead to trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a\\nTraveller’s Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs,\\nlearnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a\\npenny a time learnt me to write. I warn’t locked up as often now as\\nformerly, but I wore out my good share of key-metal still.\\n\\n“At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted\\nwi’ a man whose skull I’d crack wi’ this poker, like the claw of a\\nlobster, if I’d got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and\\nthat’s the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch,\\naccording to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last\\nnight.\\n\\n“He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he’d been to a public\\nboarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was\\na dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was the\\nnight afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth\\nthat I know’d on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when\\nI went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a\\nsporting one) called him out, and said, ‘I think this is a man that\\nmight suit you,’—meaning I was.\\n\\n“Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a\\nwatch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of\\nclothes.\\n\\n“‘To judge from appearances, you’re out of luck,’ says Compeyson to me.\\n\\n“‘Yes, master, and I’ve never been in it much.’ (I had come out of\\nKingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have\\nbeen for something else; but it warn’t.)\\n\\n“‘Luck changes,’ says Compeyson; ‘perhaps yours is going to change.’\\n\\n“I says, ‘I hope it may be so. There’s room.’\\n\\n“‘What can you do?’ says Compeyson.\\n\\n“‘Eat and drink,’ I says; ‘if you’ll find the materials.’\\n\\n“Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five\\nshillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.\\n\\n“I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on\\nto be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson’s business in which\\nwe was to go pardners? Compeyson’s business was the swindling,\\nhandwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts\\nof traps as Compeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs\\nout of and get the profits from and let another man in for, was\\nCompeyson’s business. He’d no more heart than a iron file, he was as\\ncold as death, and he had the head of the Devil afore mentioned.\\n\\n“There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,—not as\\nbeing so chrisen’d, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a\\nshadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a\\nrich lady some years afore, and they’d made a pot of money by it; but\\nCompeyson betted and gamed, and he’d have run through the king’s taxes.\\nSo, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,\\nand Compeyson’s wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity\\non him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and\\nnobody.\\n\\n“I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn’t; and I won’t pretend I\\nwas partick’ler—for where ’ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?\\nSo I begun wi’ Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur\\nlived at the top of Compeyson’s house (over nigh Brentford it was), and\\nCompeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in\\ncase he should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled\\nthe account. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a\\ntearing down into Compeyson’s parlour late at night, in only a flannel\\ngown, with his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson’s wife,\\n‘Sally, she really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can’t get rid of\\nher. She’s all in white,’ he says, ‘wi’ white flowers in her hair, and\\nshe’s awful mad, and she’s got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she\\nsays she’ll put it on me at five in the morning.’\\n\\n“Says Compeyson: ‘Why, you fool, don’t you know she’s got a living\\nbody? And how should she be up there, without coming through the door,\\nor in at the window, and up the stairs?’\\n\\n“‘I don’t know how she’s there,’ says Arthur, shivering dreadful with\\nthe horrors, ‘but she’s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,\\nawful mad. And over where her heart’s broke—_you_ broke it!—there’s\\ndrops of blood.’\\n\\n“Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. ‘Go up alonger this\\ndrivelling sick man,’ he says to his wife, ‘and Magwitch, lend her a\\nhand, will you?’ But he never come nigh himself.\\n\\n“Compeyson’s wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most\\ndreadful. ‘Why look at her!’ he cries out. ‘She’s a shaking the shroud\\nat me! Don’t you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain’t it awful to see her\\nso mad?’ Next he cries, ‘She’ll put it on me, and then I’m done for!\\nTake it away from her, take it away!’ And then he catched hold of us,\\nand kep on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed\\nI see her myself.\\n\\n“Compeyson’s wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the\\nhorrors off, and by and by he quieted. ‘O, she’s gone! Has her keeper\\nbeen for her?’ he says. ‘Yes,’ says Compeyson’s wife. ‘Did you tell him\\nto lock her and bar her in?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And to take that ugly thing away\\nfrom her?’ ‘Yes, yes, all right.’ ‘You’re a good creetur,’ he says,\\n‘don’t leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!’\\n\\n“He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and\\nthen he starts up with a scream, and screams out, ‘Here she is! She’s\\ngot the shroud again. She’s unfolding it. She’s coming out of the\\ncorner. She’s coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you—one of each\\nside—don’t let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.\\nDon’t let her throw it over my shoulders. Don’t let her lift me up to\\nget it round me. She’s lifting me up. Keep me down!’ Then he lifted\\nhimself up hard, and was dead.\\n\\n“Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and me\\nwas soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own\\nbook,—this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade\\non.\\n\\n“Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done—which ’ud\\ntake a week—I’ll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip’s comrade, that\\nthat man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always\\nin debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a\\ngetting into danger. He was younger than me, but he’d got craft, and\\nhe’d got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no\\nmercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi’—Stop though! I ain’t\\nbrought _her_ in—”\\n\\nHe looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in\\nthe book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, and\\nspread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them\\non again.\\n\\n“There ain’t no need to go into it,” he said, looking round once more.\\n“The time wi’ Compeyson was a’most as hard a time as ever I had; that\\nsaid, all’s said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for\\nmisdemeanor, while with Compeyson?”\\n\\nI answered, No.\\n\\n“Well!” he said, “I _was_, and got convicted. As to took up on\\nsuspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that\\nit lasted; but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both\\ncommitted for felony,—on a charge of putting stolen notes in\\ncirculation,—and there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me,\\n‘Separate defences, no communication,’ and that was all. And I was so\\nmiserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on\\nmy back, afore I could get Jaggers.\\n\\n“When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman\\nCompeyson looked, wi’ his curly hair and his black clothes and his\\nwhite pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked.\\nWhen the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand,\\nI noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the\\nevidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had\\ncome for’ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the\\nmoney had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work\\nthe thing and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see\\nthe plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, ‘My lord and\\ngentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your\\neyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be\\nspoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to\\nas such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here\\ntransactions, and only suspected; t’other, the elder, always seen in\\n’em and always wi’ his guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is\\nbut one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is\\nmuch the worst one?’ And such-like. And when it come to character,\\nwarn’t it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn’t it his\\nschoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn’t it him as\\nhad been know’d by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to\\nhis disadvantage? And warn’t it me as had been tried afore, and as had\\nbeen know’d up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when\\nit come to speech-making, warn’t it Compeyson as could speak to ’em wi’\\nhis face dropping every now and then into his white\\npocket-handkercher,—ah! and wi’ verses in his speech, too,—and warn’t\\nit me as could only say, ‘Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most\\nprecious rascal’? And when the verdict come, warn’t it Compeyson as was\\nrecommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and\\ngiving up all the information he could agen me, and warn’t it me as got\\nnever a word but Guilty? And when I says to Compeyson, ‘Once out of\\nthis court, I’ll smash that face of yourn!’ ain’t it Compeyson as prays\\nthe Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? And\\nwhen we’re sentenced, ain’t it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen,\\nand ain’t it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so\\nwell, and ain’t it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of\\nwiolent passion, likely to come to worse?”\\n\\nHe had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked\\nit, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching\\nout his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, “I ain’t a-going\\nto be low, dear boy!”\\n\\nHe had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped\\nhis face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“I had said to Compeyson that I’d smash that face of his, and I swore\\nLord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I\\ncouldn’t get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him\\nand hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at\\nhim, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn’t a\\nstrong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I\\nescaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there,\\nenvying them as was in ’em and all over, when I first see my boy!”\\n\\nHe regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent\\nto me again, though I had felt great pity for him.\\n\\n“By my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them\\nmarshes too. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to\\nget quit of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him\\ndown. I smashed his face. ‘And now,’ says I ‘as the worst thing I can\\ndo, caring nothing for myself, I’ll drag you back.’ And I’d have swum\\noff, towing him by the hair, if it had come to that, and I’d a got him\\naboard without the soldiers.\\n\\n“Of course he’d much the best of it to the last,—his character was so\\ngood. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous\\nintentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought\\nto trial again, and sent for life. I didn’t stop for life, dear boy and\\nPip’s comrade, being here.”\\n\\nHe wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took his\\ntangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his\\nbutton-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.\\n\\n“Is he dead?” I asked, after a silence.\\n\\n“Is who dead, dear boy?”\\n\\n“Compeyson.”\\n\\n“He hopes _I_ am, if he’s alive, you may be sure,” with a fierce look.\\n“I never heerd no more of him.”\\n\\nHerbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book. He\\nsoftly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his\\neyes on the fire, and I read in it:—\\n\\n“Young Havisham’s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed\\nto be Miss Havisham’s lover.”\\n\\nI shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by;\\nbut we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he\\nstood smoking by the fire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XLIII.\\n\\n\\nWhy should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be\\ntraced to Estella? Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state\\nof mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison\\nbefore meeting her at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which\\nI now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty,\\nand the returned transport whom I harboured? The road would be none the\\nsmoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he would not\\nbe helped, nor I extenuated.\\n\\nA new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative; or rather,\\nhis narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already\\nthere. If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return, I could\\nhardly doubt the consequence. That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of\\nhim, neither of the two could know much better than I; and that any\\nsuch man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release\\nhimself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an\\ninformer was scarcely to be imagined.\\n\\nNever had I breathed, and never would I breathe—or so I resolved—a word\\nof Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that, before I could go\\nabroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham. This was when we\\nwere left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story.\\nI resolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.\\n\\nOn my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley’s, Estella’s maid was called\\nto tell that Estella had gone into the country. Where? To Satis House,\\nas usual. Not as usual, I said, for she had never yet gone there\\nwithout me; when was she coming back? There was an air of reservation\\nin the answer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that\\nher maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while. I\\ncould make nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make\\nnothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.\\n\\nAnother night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home (I\\nalways took him home, and always looked well about me), led us to the\\nconclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came\\nback from Miss Havisham’s. In the mean time, Herbert and I were to\\nconsider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should\\ndevise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious\\nobservation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should\\npropose an expedition. We both knew that I had but to propose anything,\\nand he would consent. We agreed that his remaining many days in his\\npresent hazard was not to be thought of.\\n\\nNext day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise\\nto go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe\\nor his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and\\nHerbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to be\\nabsent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his\\nimpatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be\\nbegun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to Herbert\\nalso, that he might be best got away across the water, on that\\npretence,—as, to make purchases, or the like.\\n\\nHaving thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham’s, I set\\noff by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out on\\nthe open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and\\nwhimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of\\nmist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly\\nride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,\\nto look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!\\n\\nAs he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a\\nvery lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into\\nthe coffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I\\nordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very\\nwell knew why he had come there.\\n\\nPretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had\\nnothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of\\ncoffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which\\nit was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly\\nirregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By\\ndegrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the\\nfire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my\\nhand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to\\nstir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.\\n\\n“Is this a cut?” said Mr. Drummle.\\n\\n“Oh!” said I, poker in hand; “it’s you, is it? How do you do? I was\\nwondering who it was, who kept the fire off.”\\n\\nWith that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself\\nside by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the\\nfire.\\n\\n“You have just come down?” said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away\\nwith his shoulder.\\n\\n“Yes,” said I, edging _him_ a little away with _my_ shoulder.\\n\\n“Beastly place,” said Drummle. “Your part of the country, I think?”\\n\\n“Yes,” I assented. “I am told it’s very like your Shropshire.”\\n\\n“Not in the least like it,” said Drummle.\\n\\nHere Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.\\nDrummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.\\n\\n“Have you been here long?” I asked, determined not to yield an inch of\\nthe fire.\\n\\n“Long enough to be tired of it,” returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,\\nbut equally determined.\\n\\n“Do you stay here long?”\\n\\n“Can’t say,” answered Mr. Drummle. “Do you?”\\n\\n“Can’t say,” said I.\\n\\nI felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle’s\\nshoulder had claimed another hair’s breadth of room, I should have\\njerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged\\na similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.\\nHe whistled a little. So did I.\\n\\n“Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?” said Drummle.\\n\\n“Yes. What of that?” said I.\\n\\nMr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, “Oh!”\\nand laughed.\\n\\n“Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?”\\n\\n“No,” said he, “not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the\\nsaddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way\\nvillages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses—and\\nsmithies—and that. Waiter!”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“Is that horse of mine ready?”\\n\\n“Brought round to the door, sir.”\\n\\n“I say. Look here, you sir. The lady won’t ride to-day; the weather\\nwon’t do.”\\n\\n“Very good, sir.”\\n\\n“And I don’t dine, because I’m going to dine at the lady’s.”\\n\\n“Very good, sir.”\\n\\nThen, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his\\ngreat-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so\\nexasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the\\nrobber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat\\nhim on the fire.\\n\\nOne thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief\\ncame, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well\\nsquared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our\\nhands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in\\nthe drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle’s\\nwas cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both\\nstood our ground.\\n\\n“Have you been to the Grove since?” said Drummle.\\n\\n“No,” said I, “I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was\\nthere.”\\n\\n“Was that when we had a difference of opinion?”\\n\\n“Yes,” I replied, very shortly.\\n\\n“Come, come! They let you off easily enough,” sneered Drummle. “You\\nshouldn’t have lost your temper.”\\n\\n“Mr. Drummle,” said I, “you are not competent to give advice on that\\nsubject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that\\noccasion), I don’t throw glasses.”\\n\\n“I do,” said Drummle.\\n\\nAfter glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of\\nsmouldering ferocity, I said,—\\n\\n“Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don’t think it an\\nagreeable one.”\\n\\n“I am sure it’s not,” said he, superciliously over his shoulder; “I\\ndon’t think anything about it.”\\n\\n“And therefore,” I went on, “with your leave, I will suggest that we\\nhold no kind of communication in future.”\\n\\n“Quite my opinion,” said Drummle, “and what I should have suggested\\nmyself, or done—more likely—without suggesting. But don’t lose your\\ntemper. Haven’t you lost enough without that?”\\n\\n“What do you mean, sir?”\\n\\n“Waiter!” said Drummle, by way of answering me.\\n\\nThe waiter reappeared.\\n\\n“Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don’t\\nride to-day, and that I dine at the young lady’s?”\\n\\n“Quite so, sir!”\\n\\nWhen the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his\\nhand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,\\ncareful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket\\nand bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and\\nboiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without\\nintroducing Estella’s name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;\\nand therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were\\nno one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have\\nremained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but for\\nthe incursion of three thriving farmers—laid on by the waiter, I\\nthink—who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and\\nrubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we\\nwere obliged to give way.\\n\\nI saw him through the window, seizing his horse’s mane, and mounting in\\nhis blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought\\nhe was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in\\nhis mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-coloured dress\\nappeared with what was wanted,—I could not have said from where:\\nwhether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not,—and as Drummle\\nleaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a\\njerk of his head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching\\nshoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me\\nreminded me of Orlick.\\n\\nToo heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or\\nno, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the\\njourney from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house\\nthat it would have been so much the better for me never to have\\nentered, never to have seen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XLIV.\\n\\n\\nIn the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles\\nburnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham\\nseated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.\\nEstella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both\\nraised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I\\nderived that, from the look they interchanged.\\n\\n“And what wind,” said Miss Havisham, “blows you here, Pip?”\\n\\nThough she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.\\nEstella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and\\nthen going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as\\nplainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived\\nI had discovered my real benefactor.\\n\\n“Miss Havisham,” said I, “I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to\\nEstella; and finding that some wind had blown _her_ here, I followed.”\\n\\nMiss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,\\nI took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her\\noccupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural\\nplace for me, that day.\\n\\n“What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,\\npresently—in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not\\ndisplease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.”\\n\\nMiss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the\\naction of Estella’s fingers as they worked that she attended to what I\\nsaid; but she did not look up.\\n\\n“I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,\\nand is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,\\nanything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not\\nmy secret, but another’s.”\\n\\nAs I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to\\ngo on, Miss Havisham repeated, “It is not your secret, but another’s.\\nWell?”\\n\\n“When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I\\nbelonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left, I\\nsuppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have\\ncome,—as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid\\nfor it?”\\n\\n“Ay, Pip,” replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; “you did.”\\n\\n“And that Mr. Jaggers—”\\n\\n“Mr. Jaggers,” said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, “had\\nnothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, and\\nhis being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same\\nrelation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that\\nas it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.”\\n\\nAny one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no\\nsuppression or evasion so far.\\n\\n“But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least\\nyou led me on?” said I.\\n\\n“Yes,” she returned, again nodding steadily, “I let you go on.”\\n\\n“Was that kind?”\\n\\n“Who am I,” cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor and\\nflashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in\\nsurprise,—“who am I, for God’s sake, that I should be kind?”\\n\\nIt was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I\\ntold her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.\\n\\n“Well, well, well!” she said. “What else?”\\n\\n“I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,” I said, to soothe\\nher, “in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for\\nmy own information. What follows has another (and I hope more\\ndisinterested) purpose. In humouring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you\\npunished—practised on—perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses\\nyour intention, without offence—your self-seeking relations?”\\n\\n“I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my\\nhistory, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you\\nnot to have it so! You made your own snares. _I_ never made them.”\\n\\nWaiting until she was quiet again,—for this, too, flashed out of her in\\na wild and sudden way,—I went on.\\n\\n“I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,\\nand have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them\\nto have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be\\nfalse and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you\\nor no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that\\nyou deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you\\nsuppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and\\nincapable of anything designing or mean.”\\n\\n“They are your friends,” said Miss Havisham.\\n\\n“They made themselves my friends,” said I, “when they supposed me to\\nhave superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and\\nMistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.”\\n\\nThis contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do\\nthem good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and\\nthen said quietly,—\\n\\n“What do you want for them?”\\n\\n“Only,” said I, “that you would not confound them with the others. They\\nmay be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same\\nnature.”\\n\\nStill looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,—\\n\\n“What do you want for them?”\\n\\n“I am not so cunning, you see,” I said, in answer, conscious that I\\nreddened a little, “as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,\\nthat I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money\\nto do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the\\nnature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you\\nhow.”\\n\\n“Why must it be done without his knowledge?” she asked, settling her\\nhands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.\\n\\n“Because,” said I, “I began the service myself, more than two years\\nago, without his knowledge, and I don’t want to be betrayed. Why I fail\\nin my ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the\\nsecret which is another person’s and not mine.”\\n\\nShe gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.\\nAfter watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of\\nthe slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by the\\ncollapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again—at\\nfirst, vacantly—then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All\\nthis time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her\\nattention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in\\nour dialogue,—\\n\\n“What else?”\\n\\n“Estella,” said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my\\ntrembling voice, “you know I love you. You know that I have loved you\\nlong and dearly.”\\n\\nShe raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her\\nfingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved\\ncountenance. I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from\\nher to me.\\n\\n“I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me\\nto hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought\\nyou could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it.\\nBut I must say it now.”\\n\\nPreserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,\\nEstella shook her head.\\n\\n“I know,” said I, in answer to that action,—“I know. I have no hope\\nthat I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become\\nof me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love\\nyou. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.”\\n\\nLooking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook\\nher head again.\\n\\n“It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise\\non the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all\\nthese years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected\\non the gravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that,\\nin the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.”\\n\\nI saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she\\nsat looking by turns at Estella and at me.\\n\\n“It seems,” said Estella, very calmly, “that there are sentiments,\\nfancies,—I don’t know how to call them,—which I am not able to\\ncomprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form\\nof words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch\\nnothing there. I don’t care for what you say at all. I have tried to\\nwarn you of this; now, have I not?”\\n\\nI said in a miserable manner, “Yes.”\\n\\n“Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.\\nNow, did you not think so?”\\n\\n“I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and\\nbeautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.”\\n\\n“It is in _my_ nature,” she returned. And then she added, with a stress\\nupon the words, “It is in the nature formed within me. I make a great\\ndifference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can\\ndo no more.”\\n\\n“Is it not true,” said I, “that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and\\npursuing you?”\\n\\n“It is quite true,” she replied, referring to him with the indifference\\nof utter contempt.\\n\\n“That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with\\nyou this very day?”\\n\\nShe seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,\\n“Quite true.”\\n\\n“You cannot love him, Estella!”\\n\\nHer fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,\\n“What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do\\nnot mean what I say?”\\n\\n“You would never marry him, Estella?”\\n\\nShe looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her\\nwork in her hands. Then she said, “Why not tell you the truth? I am\\ngoing to be married to him.”\\n\\nI dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better\\nthan I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear\\nher say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a\\nghastly look upon Miss Havisham’s, that it impressed me, even in my\\npassionate hurry and grief.\\n\\n“Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this\\nfatal step. Put me aside for ever,—you have done so, I well know,—but\\nbestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham\\ngives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done\\nto the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly\\nlove you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as\\ndearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can\\nbear it better, for your sake!”\\n\\nMy earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have\\nbeen touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all\\nintelligible to her own mind.\\n\\n“I am going,” she said again, in a gentler voice, “to be married to\\nhim. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be\\nmarried soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by\\nadoption? It is my own act.”\\n\\n“Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?”\\n\\n“On whom should I fling myself away?” she retorted, with a smile.\\n“Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if\\npeople do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is\\ndone. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading me\\ninto what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me\\nwait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which\\nhas very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say\\nno more. We shall never understand each other.”\\n\\n“Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!” I urged, in despair.\\n\\n“Don’t be afraid of my being a blessing to him,” said Estella; “I shall\\nnot be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary\\nboy—or man?”\\n\\n“O Estella!” I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do\\nwhat I would to restrain them; “even if I remained in England and could\\nhold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle’s wife?”\\n\\n“Nonsense,” she returned,—“nonsense. This will pass in no time.”\\n\\n“Never, Estella!”\\n\\n“You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.”\\n\\n“Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You\\nhave been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the\\nrough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been\\nin every prospect I have ever seen since,—on the river, on the sails of\\nthe ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the\\ndarkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You\\nhave been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever\\nbecome acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London\\nbuildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to be\\ndisplaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to\\nme, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my\\nlife, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the\\nlittle good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I\\nassociate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to\\nthat always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me\\nfeel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!”\\n\\nIn what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself,\\nI don’t know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an\\ninward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingering\\nmoments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,—and soon\\nafterwards with stronger reason,—that while Estella looked at me merely\\nwith incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand\\nstill covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of\\npity and remorse.\\n\\nAll done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went out at\\nthe gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker colour than when I\\nwent in. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and\\nthen struck off to walk all the way to London. For, I had by that time\\ncome to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the\\ninn and see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach\\nand be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as\\ntire myself out.\\n\\nIt was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the narrow\\nintricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the\\nMiddlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was\\nclose by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till\\nto-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could\\nget to bed myself without disturbing him.\\n\\nAs it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the\\nTemple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it\\nill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he held\\nthe gate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his memory I\\nmentioned my name.\\n\\n“I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here’s a note, sir. The\\nmessenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my\\nlantern?”\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMuch surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to\\nPhilip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the\\nwords, “PLEASE READ THIS, HERE.” I opened it, the watchman holding up\\nhis light, and read inside, in Wemmick’s writing,—\\n\\n“DON’T GO HOME.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XLV.\\n\\n\\nTurning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made\\nthe best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney\\nchariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed\\nwas always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the\\nchamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next\\nin order on his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in\\norder on his list. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the\\nback, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling\\nover the whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the\\nfireplace and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched\\nlittle washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.\\n\\nAs I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,\\nbefore he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those\\nvirtuous days—an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which\\ninstantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever\\nbe lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the\\nbottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a\\nstaringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and\\nlay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more\\nclose my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.\\nAnd thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one\\nanother.\\n\\nWhat a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an\\ninhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I\\nlooked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a\\nnumber of blue-bottle flies from the butchers’, and earwigs from the\\nmarket, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying\\nby for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever\\ntumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,—a\\ndisagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable\\napproaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those\\nextraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves\\naudible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little\\nwashing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the\\nchest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired\\na new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw\\nwritten, DON’T GO HOME.\\n\\nWhatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never\\nwarded off this DON’T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I\\nthought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had\\nread in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums\\nin the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had\\nbeen found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that\\nhe must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to\\nassure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door\\nto look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship\\nof a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But\\nall this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,\\nand when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were\\nquestions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed\\nthere could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I\\nthought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I\\nrecalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and\\ntones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,—even then I was\\npursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don’t go home.\\nWhen at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a\\nvast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present\\ntense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do\\nnot ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may\\nnot and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and\\nshould not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and\\nrolled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the\\nwall again.\\n\\nI had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was\\nplain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally\\nplain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could\\nbe taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had\\nbeen so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to\\nstartle me from my uneasy bed.\\n\\nThe Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o’clock. The little\\nservant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I\\npassed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company,\\nand so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was\\nmaking tea for himself and the Aged. An open door afforded a\\nperspective view of the Aged in bed.\\n\\n“Halloa, Mr. Pip!” said Wemmick. “You did come home, then?”\\n\\n“Yes,” I returned; “but I didn’t go home.”\\n\\n“That’s all right,” said he, rubbing his hands. “I left a note for you\\nat each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come\\nto?”\\n\\nI told him.\\n\\n“I’ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the\\nnotes,” said Wemmick; “it’s a good rule never to leave documentary\\nevidence if you can help it, because you don’t know when it may be put\\nin. I’m going to take a liberty with you. _Would_ you mind toasting\\nthis sausage for the Aged P.?”\\n\\nI said I should be delighted to do it.\\n\\n“Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne,” said Wemmick to the\\nlittle servant; “which leaves us to ourselves, don’t you see, Mr. Pip?”\\nhe added, winking, as she disappeared.\\n\\nI thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse\\nproceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged’s sausage and he\\nbuttered the crumb of the Aged’s roll.\\n\\n“Now, Mr. Pip, you know,” said Wemmick, “you and I understand one\\nanother. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have\\nbeen engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official\\nsentiments are one thing. We are extra official.”\\n\\nI cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted\\nthe Aged’s sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.\\n\\n“I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “being in a\\ncertain place where I once took you,—even between you and me, it’s as\\nwell not to mention names when avoidable—”\\n\\n“Much better not,” said I. “I understand you.”\\n\\n“I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “that a\\ncertain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not\\nunpossessed of portable property,—I don’t know who it may really be,—we\\nwon’t name this person—”\\n\\n“Not necessary,” said I.\\n\\n“—Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good\\nmany people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,\\nand not quite irrespective of the government expense—”\\n\\nIn watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged’s sausage,\\nand greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick’s; for which\\nI apologised.\\n\\n“—By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of\\nthereabouts. From which,” said Wemmick, “conjectures had been raised\\nand theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden\\nCourt, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.”\\n\\n“By whom?” said I.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t go into that,” said Wemmick, evasively, “it might clash\\nwith official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard\\nother curious things in the same place. I don’t tell it you on\\ninformation received. I heard it.”\\n\\nHe took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set\\nforth the Aged’s breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing\\nit before him, he went into the Aged’s room with a clean white cloth,\\nand tied the same under the old gentleman’s chin, and propped him up,\\nand put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Then\\nhe placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, “All\\nright, ain’t you, Aged P.?” To which the cheerful Aged replied, “All\\nright, John, my boy, all right!” As there seemed to be a tacit\\nunderstanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was\\ntherefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in\\ncomplete ignorance of these proceedings.\\n\\n“This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to\\nsuspect),” I said to Wemmick when he came back, “is inseparable from\\nthe person to whom you have adverted; is it?”\\n\\nWemmick looked very serious. “I couldn’t undertake to say that, of my\\nown knowledge. I mean, I couldn’t undertake to say it was at first. But\\nit either is, or it will be, or it’s in great danger of being.”\\n\\nAs I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying\\nas much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out\\nof his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I\\ntold him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to\\nask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he\\ndeemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his\\nbreakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his\\nnotion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me\\nonce, to put my question.\\n\\n“You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is\\nCompeyson?”\\n\\nHe answered with one other nod.\\n\\n“Is he living?”\\n\\nOne other nod.\\n\\n“Is he in London?”\\n\\nHe gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave\\nme one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.\\n\\n“Now,” said Wemmick, “questioning being over,” which he emphasised and\\nrepeated for my guidance, “I come to what I did, after hearing what I\\nheard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to\\nClarriker’s to find Mr. Herbert.”\\n\\n“And him you found?” said I, with great anxiety.\\n\\n“And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any\\ndetails, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody—Tom,\\nJack, or Richard—being about the chambers, or about the immediate\\nneighbourhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way\\nwhile you were out of the way.”\\n\\n“He would be greatly puzzled what to do?”\\n\\n“He _was_ puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my\\nopinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too\\nfar out of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I’ll tell you something. Under\\nexisting circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you\\nare once in it. Don’t break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things\\nslacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.”\\n\\nI thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had\\ndone?\\n\\n“Mr. Herbert,” said Wemmick, “after being all of a heap for half an\\nhour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is\\ncourting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden\\nPa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a\\nbow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You\\nare acquainted with the young lady, most probably?”\\n\\n“Not personally,” said I.\\n\\nThe truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion\\nwho did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to\\npresent me to her, she had received the proposal with such very\\nmoderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the\\nstate of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time\\nbefore I made her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert’s\\nprospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful\\nphilosophy: he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally not\\nbeen very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews;\\nand thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara’s esteem,\\nand although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged\\nmessages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her. However, I\\ndid not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.\\n\\n“The house with the bow-window,” said Wemmick, “being by the\\nriver-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and\\nbeing kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished\\nupper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that\\nas a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very\\nwell of it, for three reasons I’ll give you. That is to say: _Firstly_.\\nIt’s altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual\\nheap of streets great and small. _Secondly_. Without going near it\\nyourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard,\\nthrough Mr. Herbert. _Thirdly_. After a while and when it might be\\nprudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a\\nforeign packet-boat, there he is—ready.”\\n\\nMuch comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and\\nagain, and begged him to proceed.\\n\\n“Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will,\\nand by nine o’clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or\\nRichard,—whichever it may be,—you and I don’t want to know,—quite\\nsuccessfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that he was\\nsummoned to Dover, and, in fact, he was taken down the Dover road and\\ncornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this is, that\\nit was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself\\nabout your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off\\nand quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion and confuses it;\\nand for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back last\\nnight, you should not go home. It brings in more confusion, and you\\nwant confusion.”\\n\\nWemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, and\\nbegan to get his coat on.\\n\\n“And now, Mr. Pip,” said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, “I\\nhave probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,—from a\\nWalworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal\\ncapacity,—I shall be glad to do it. Here’s the address. There can be no\\nharm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is\\nwell with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,—which is another\\nreason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gone\\nhome, don’t go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip”;\\nhis hands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them; “and let\\nme finally impress one important point upon you.” He laid his hands\\nupon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: “Avail yourself of\\nthis evening to lay hold of his portable property. You don’t know what\\nmay happen to him. Don’t let anything happen to the portable property.”\\n\\nQuite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I\\nforbore to try.\\n\\n“Time’s up,” said Wemmick, “and I must be off. If you had nothing more\\npressing to do than to keep here till dark, that’s what I should\\nadvise. You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a\\nperfectly quiet day with the Aged,—he’ll be up presently,—and a little\\nbit of—you remember the pig?”\\n\\n“Of course,” said I.\\n\\n“Well; and a little bit of _him_. That sausage you toasted was his, and\\nhe was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for old\\nacquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!” in a cheery shout.\\n\\n“All right, John; all right, my boy!” piped the old man from within.\\n\\nI soon fell asleep before Wemmick’s fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed\\none another’s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.\\nWe had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and I\\nnodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it\\ndrowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire\\nfor toast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from\\nhis glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was\\nexpected.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XLVI.\\n\\n\\nEight o’clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented,\\nnot disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore\\nboat-builders, and mast, oar, and block makers. All that water-side\\nregion of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to\\nme; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted\\nwas not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to\\nfind. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks’s Basin; and I had no other\\nguide to Chinks’s Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.\\n\\nIt matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself\\namong, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces,\\nwhat ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of\\nship-builders and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into\\nthe ground, though for years off duty, what mountainous country of\\naccumulated casks and timber, how many rope-walks that were not the Old\\nGreen Copper. After several times falling short of my destination and\\nas often overshooting it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill\\nPond Bank. It was a fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered,\\nwhere the wind from the river had room to turn itself round; and there\\nwere two or three trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined\\nwindmill, and there was the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,—whose long and\\nnarrow vista I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden\\nframes set in the ground, that looked like superannuated\\nhaymaking-rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth.\\n\\nSelecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a\\nwooden front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which is\\nanother thing), I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there,\\nMrs. Whimple. That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly\\nwoman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She was\\nimmediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into the\\nparlour and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his very\\nfamiliar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room\\nand region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at the\\ncorner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the\\nchimney-piece, and the coloured engravings on the wall, representing\\nthe death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George\\nthe Third in a state coachman’s wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots,\\non the terrace at Windsor.\\n\\n“All is well, Handel,” said Herbert, “and he is quite satisfied, though\\neager to see you. My dear girl is with her father; and if you’ll wait\\ntill she comes down, I’ll make you known to her, and then we’ll go\\nupstairs. _That’s_ her father.”\\n\\nI had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably\\nexpressed the fact in my countenance.\\n\\n“I am afraid he is a sad old rascal,” said Herbert, smiling, “but I\\nhave never seen him. Don’t you smell rum? He is always at it.”\\n\\n“At rum?” said I.\\n\\n“Yes,” returned Herbert, “and you may suppose how mild it makes his\\ngout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his\\nroom, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his head, and\\n_will_ weigh them all. His room must be like a chandler’s shop.”\\n\\nWhile he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and\\nthen died away.\\n\\n“What else can be the consequence,” said Herbert, in explanation, “if\\nhe _will_ cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right hand—and\\neverywhere else—can’t expect to get through a Double Gloucester without\\nhurting himself.”\\n\\nHe seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furious\\nroar.\\n\\n“To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs.\\nWhimple,” said Herbert, “for of course people in general won’t stand\\nthat noise. A curious place, Handel; isn’t it?”\\n\\nIt was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.\\n\\n“Mrs. Whimple,” said Herbert, when I told him so, “is the best of\\nhousewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her\\nmotherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no\\nrelation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.”\\n\\n“Surely that’s not his name, Herbert?”\\n\\n“No, no,” said Herbert, “that’s my name for him. His name is Mr.\\nBarley. But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother\\nto love a girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself\\nor anybody else about her family!”\\n\\nHerbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he\\nfirst knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at\\nan establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home to\\nnurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the\\nmotherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated with\\nequal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that\\nnothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by\\nreason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject\\nmore psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser’s stores.\\n\\nAs we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley’s sustained\\ngrowl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door\\nopened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came\\nin with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the\\nbasket, and presented, blushing, as “Clara.” She really was a most\\ncharming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that\\ntruculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.\\n\\n“Look here,” said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate\\nand tender smile, after we had talked a little; “here’s poor Clara’s\\nsupper, served out every night. Here’s her allowance of bread, and\\nhere’s her slice of cheese, and here’s her rum,—which I drink. This is\\nMr. Barley’s breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two\\nmutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two\\nounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It’s\\nstewed up together, and taken hot, and it’s a nice thing for the gout,\\nI should think!”\\n\\nThere was something so natural and winning in Clara’s resigned way of\\nlooking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and\\nsomething so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of\\nyielding herself to Herbert’s embracing arm; and something so gentle in\\nher, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks’s Basin,\\nand the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the\\nbeam,—that I would not have undone the engagement between her and\\nHerbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.\\n\\nI was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the\\ngrowl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was\\nheard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it\\nthrough the ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert,\\n“Papa wants me, darling!” and ran away.\\n\\n“There is an unconscionable old shark for you!” said Herbert. “What do\\nyou suppose he wants now, Handel?”\\n\\n“I don’t know,” said I. “Something to drink?”\\n\\n“That’s it!” cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary\\nmerit. “He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.\\nWait a moment, and you’ll hear Clara lift him up to take some. There he\\ngoes!” Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. “Now,” said\\nHerbert, as it was succeeded by silence, “he’s drinking. Now,” said\\nHerbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, “he’s down again\\non his back!”\\n\\nClara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to\\nsee our charge. As we passed Mr. Barley’s door, he was heard hoarsely\\nmuttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the\\nfollowing Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something\\nquite the reverse:—\\n\\n“Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here’s old Bill Barley. Here’s old Bill Barley,\\nbless your eyes. Here’s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by the\\nLord. Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder,\\nhere’s your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you.”\\n\\nIn this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley\\nwould commune with himself by the day and night together; Often, while\\nit was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which\\nwas fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.\\n\\nIn his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and\\nairy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found\\nProvis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and seemed to feel\\nnone that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he was\\nsoftened,—indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never\\nafterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.\\n\\nThe opportunity that the day’s rest had given me for reflection had\\nresulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting\\nCompeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man might\\notherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own\\ndestruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his\\nfire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick’s judgment\\nand sources of information?\\n\\n“Ay, ay, dear boy!” he answered, with a grave nod, “Jaggers knows.”\\n\\n“Then, I have talked with Wemmick,” said I, “and have come to tell you\\nwhat caution he gave me and what advice.”\\n\\nThis I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told\\nhim how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or\\nprisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that\\nmy chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping\\nclose for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had\\nsaid about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time\\ncame, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might\\nbe safest in Wemmick’s judgment. What was to follow that I did not\\ntouch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it\\nin my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in\\ndeclared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living by\\nenlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled\\nand difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it\\nwere no worse?\\n\\nHe could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His\\ncoming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a\\nventure. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had\\nvery little fear of his safety with such good help.\\n\\nHerbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said that\\nsomething had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick’s\\nsuggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. “We are both good\\nwatermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the\\nright time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no\\nboatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance\\nis worth saving. Never mind the season; don’t you think it might be a\\ngood thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs,\\nand were in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into\\nthat habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times,\\nand there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or\\nfifty-first.”\\n\\nI liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed that\\nit should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never\\nrecognise us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank.\\nBut we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part\\nof his window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was\\nright.\\n\\nOur conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go;\\nremarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, and\\nthat I would take half an hour’s start of him. “I don’t like to leave\\nyou here,” I said to Provis, “though I cannot doubt your being safer\\nhere than near me. Good-bye!”\\n\\n“Dear boy,” he answered, clasping my hands, “I don’t know when we may\\nmeet again, and I don’t like good-bye. Say good-night!”\\n\\n“Good-night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time\\ncomes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good-night, good-night!”\\n\\nWe thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms; and we left\\nhim on the landing outside his door, holding a light over the\\nstair-rail to light us downstairs. Looking back at him, I thought of\\nthe first night of his return, when our positions were reversed, and\\nwhen I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at\\nparting from him as it was now.\\n\\nOld Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with no\\nappearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the\\nfoot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name\\nof Provis. He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr.\\nCampbell. He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there\\nwas, that he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt a\\nstrong personal interest in his being well cared for, and living a\\nsecluded life. So, when we went into the parlour where Mrs. Whimple and\\nClara were seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr.\\nCampbell, but kept it to myself.\\n\\nWhen I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and of\\nthe motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a\\nlittle affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walk\\nhad grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the\\nhills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were\\nredeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks’s Basin to fill it\\nto overflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and\\nwent home very sadly.\\n\\nAll things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The\\nwindows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark\\nand still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the\\nfountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between\\nme and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my bedside\\nwhen he came in,—for I went straight to bed, dispirited and\\nfatigued,—made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,\\nhe looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as\\nsolemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.\\n\\nNext day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat\\nwas brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her\\nwithin a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and\\npractice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in\\ncold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been\\nout a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the\\nhours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old\\nLondon Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there\\nwas a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But\\nI knew well enough how to ‘shoot’ the bridge after seeing it done, and\\nso began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to\\nErith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were\\npulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the\\nblind towards the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less\\nfrequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a single\\nword of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there\\nwas cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being\\nwatched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning\\npersons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.\\n\\nIn short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in\\nhiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to\\nstand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down,\\nand to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards\\nClara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch,\\nand that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going\\nswiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XLVII.\\n\\n\\nSome weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,\\nand he made no sign. If I had never known him out of Little Britain,\\nand had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at\\nthe Castle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing him\\nas I did.\\n\\nMy worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed\\nfor money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the\\nwant of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve\\nit by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But\\nI had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more\\nmoney from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and\\nplans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert,\\nto hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction—whether\\nit was a false kind or a true, I hardly know—in not having profited by\\nhis generosity since his revelation of himself.\\n\\nAs the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella\\nwas married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a\\nconviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had\\nconfided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of her\\nto me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of\\nhope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you\\nwho read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own\\nlast year, last month, last week?\\n\\nIt was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,\\ntowering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a\\nrange of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause\\nfor fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror\\nfresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would\\nwith dread, for Herbert’s returning step at night, lest it should be\\nfleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,—for all that, and\\nmuch more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to\\ninaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed\\nabout in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.\\n\\nThere were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could\\nnot get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London\\nBridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be\\nbrought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing\\nthis, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the\\nwater-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings\\nthat I have now to tell of.\\n\\nOne afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the\\nwharf at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide,\\nand had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had\\nbecome foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back\\namong the shipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I\\nhad seen the signal in his window, All well.\\n\\nAs it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort\\nmyself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and\\nsolitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would\\nafterwards go to the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved\\nhis questionable triumph was in that water-side neighbourhood (it is\\nnowhere now), and to that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that\\nMr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the\\ncontrary, had rather partaken of its decline. He had been ominously\\nheard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection\\nwith a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen\\nhim as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red\\nbrick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.\\n\\nI dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,\\nwhere there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every\\nhalf-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the\\nknives,—to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the\\nLord Mayor’s dominions which is not geographical,—and wore out the time\\nin dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of\\ndinners. By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.\\n\\nThere, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty’s service,—a most\\nexcellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so\\ntight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,—who knocked all\\nthe little men’s hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and\\nbrave, and who wouldn’t hear of anybody’s paying taxes, though he was\\nvery patriotic. He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in\\nthe cloth, and on that property married a young person in\\nbed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of\\nPortsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beach\\nto rub their own hands and shake everybody else’s, and sing “Fill,\\nfill!” A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn’t fill, or\\ndo anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly\\nstated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed\\nto two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so\\neffectually done (the Swab family having considerable political\\ninfluence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and then\\nit was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white\\nhat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a\\ngridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down\\nfrom behind with the gridiron whom he couldn’t confute with what he had\\noverheard. This led to Mr. Wopsle’s (who had never been heard of\\nbefore) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of\\ngreat power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all\\nto go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain down\\nthe Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services. The\\nboatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his eyes on\\nthe Jack, and then cheering up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your\\nHonour, solicited permission to take him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle,\\nconceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into\\na dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that\\ncorner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of\\nme.\\n\\nThe second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in\\nthe first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr.\\nWopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric\\ncountenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged in\\nthe manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great\\ncowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.\\nBut he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,\\nthe Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,—on account of\\nthe parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of\\nhis daughter’s heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a\\nflour-sack, out of the first-floor window,—summoned a sententious\\nEnchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily,\\nafter an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a\\nhigh-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm.\\nThe business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked\\nat, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various\\ncolours, he had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with\\ngreat surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he\\nwere lost in amazement.\\n\\nThere was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.\\nWopsle’s eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his\\nmind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat\\nthinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large\\nwatch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking of\\nit when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him\\nwaiting for me near the door.\\n\\n“How do you do?” said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down the\\nstreet together. “I saw that you saw me.”\\n\\n“Saw you, Mr. Pip!” he returned. “Yes, of course I saw you. But who\\nelse was there?”\\n\\n“Who else?”\\n\\n“It is the strangest thing,” said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost\\nlook again; “and yet I could swear to him.”\\n\\nBecoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.\\n\\n“Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,”\\nsaid Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, “I can’t be positive;\\nyet I think I should.”\\n\\nInvoluntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me\\nwhen I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.\\n\\n“Oh! He can’t be in sight,” said Mr. Wopsle. “He went out before I went\\noff. I saw him go.”\\n\\nHaving the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected\\nthis poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some\\nadmission. Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, but\\nsaid nothing.\\n\\n“I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw\\nthat you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like a\\nghost.”\\n\\nMy former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak\\nyet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on\\nto induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was\\nperfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.\\n\\n“I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it is\\nso very strange! You’ll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I\\ncould hardly believe it myself, if you told me.”\\n\\n“Indeed?” said I.\\n\\n“No, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas\\nDay, when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery’s, and some\\nsoldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?”\\n\\n“I remember it very well.”\\n\\n“And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that\\nwe joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I took\\nthe lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?”\\n\\n“I remember it all very well.” Better than he thought,—except the last\\nclause.\\n\\n“And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that\\nthere was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been\\nseverely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?”\\n\\n“I see it all before me.”\\n\\n“And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,\\nand that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,\\nwith the torchlight shining on their faces,—I am particular about\\nthat,—with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an\\nouter ring of dark night all about us?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said I. “I remember all that.”\\n\\n“Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I\\nsaw him over your shoulder.”\\n\\n“Steady!” I thought. I asked him then, “Which of the two do you suppose\\nyou saw?”\\n\\n“The one who had been mauled,” he answered readily, “and I’ll swear I\\nsaw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him.”\\n\\n“This is very curious!” said I, with the best assumption I could put on\\nof its being nothing more to me. “Very curious indeed!”\\n\\nI cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation\\nthrew me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson’s\\nhaving been behind me “like a ghost.” For if he had ever been out of my\\nthoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was\\nin those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that I\\nshould be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if I\\nhad shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had\\nfound him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,\\nbecause I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger\\nthere might be about us, danger was always near and active.\\n\\nI put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He\\ncould not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.\\nIt was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to\\nidentify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me,\\nand known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How\\nwas he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought,\\nin black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I\\nbelieved not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no\\nespecial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a\\nface at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I\\nextract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate\\nrefreshment, after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was\\nbetween twelve and one o’clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates\\nwere shut. No one was near me when I went in and went home.\\n\\nHerbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire.\\nBut there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what\\nI had that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his\\nhint. As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to\\nthe Castle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before I\\nwent to bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me.\\nHerbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very\\ncautious. And we were very cautious indeed,—more cautious than before,\\nif that were possible,—and I for my part never went near Chinks’s\\nBasin, except when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank\\nas I looked at anything else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XLVIII.\\n\\n\\nThe second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred\\nabout a week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharf\\nbelow Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and,\\nundecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was\\nstrolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy\\nconcourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one\\novertaking me. It was Mr. Jaggers’s hand, and he passed it through my\\narm.\\n\\n“As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together.\\nWhere are you bound for?”\\n\\n“For the Temple, I think,” said I.\\n\\n“Don’t you know?” said Mr. Jaggers.\\n\\n“Well,” I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in\\ncross-examination, “I do _not_ know, for I have not made up my mind.”\\n\\n“You are going to dine?” said Mr. Jaggers. “You don’t mind admitting\\nthat, I suppose?”\\n\\n“No,” I returned, “I don’t mind admitting that.”\\n\\n“And are not engaged?”\\n\\n“I don’t mind admitting also that I am not engaged.”\\n\\n“Then,” said Mr. Jaggers, “come and dine with me.”\\n\\nI was going to excuse myself, when he added, “Wemmick’s coming.” So I\\nchanged my excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered,\\nserving for the beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside and\\nslanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up\\nbrilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely\\nfinding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the\\nafternoon’s bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out,\\nopening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at\\nthe Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.\\n\\nAt the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,\\nhand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the\\nbusiness of the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers’s fire, its rising\\nand falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were\\nplaying a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse,\\nfat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a\\ncorner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance\\nof a host of hanged clients.\\n\\nWe went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And,\\nas soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have\\nthought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much\\nas a look to Wemmick’s Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no\\nobjection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it\\nwas not to be done. He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he\\nraised them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if\\nthere were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.\\n\\n“Did you send that note of Miss Havisham’s to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?” Mr.\\nJaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.\\n\\n“No, sir,” returned Wemmick; “it was going by post, when you brought\\nMr. Pip into the office. Here it is.” He handed it to his principal\\ninstead of to me.\\n\\n“It’s a note of two lines, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, “sent\\nup to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your\\naddress. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of\\nbusiness you mentioned to her. You’ll go down?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in\\nthose terms.\\n\\n“When do you think of going down?”\\n\\n“I have an impending engagement,” said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was\\nputting fish into the post-office, “that renders me rather uncertain of\\nmy time. At once, I think.”\\n\\n“If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,” said Wemmick to Mr.\\nJaggers, “he needn’t write an answer, you know.”\\n\\nReceiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I\\nsettled that I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass\\nof wine, and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not\\nat me.\\n\\n“So, Pip! Our friend the Spider,” said Mr. Jaggers, “has played his\\ncards. He has won the pool.”\\n\\nIt was as much as I could do to assent.\\n\\n“Hah! He is a promising fellow—in his way—but he may not have it all\\nhis own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to\\nbe found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her—”\\n\\n“Surely,” I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, “you do not\\nseriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?”\\n\\n“I didn’t say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and\\nbeat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be\\na question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance work\\nto give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such\\ncircumstances, because it’s a toss-up between two results.”\\n\\n“May I ask what they are?”\\n\\n“A fellow like our friend the Spider,” answered Mr. Jaggers, “either\\nbeats or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but\\nhe either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick _his_ opinion.”\\n\\n“Either beats or cringes,” said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself\\nto me.\\n\\n“So here’s to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,” said Mr. Jaggers, taking a\\ndecanter of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of\\nus and for himself, “and may the question of supremacy be settled to\\nthe lady’s satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady _and_ the\\ngentleman, it never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow\\nyou are to-day!”\\n\\nShe was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon the\\ntable. As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,\\nnervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers,\\nas she spoke, arrested my attention.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” said Mr. Jaggers.\\n\\n“Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,” said I, “was rather\\npainful to me.”\\n\\nThe action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood\\nlooking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or\\nwhether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did\\ngo. Her look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and\\nsuch hands on a memorable occasion very lately!\\n\\nHe dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained\\nbefore me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those\\nhands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I\\ncompared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,\\nand with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and\\na stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the\\nhousekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over\\nme when I last walked—not alone—in the ruined garden, and through the\\ndeserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I\\nsaw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach\\nwindow; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like\\nlightning, when I had passed in a carriage—not alone—through a sudden\\nglare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association\\nhad helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,\\nwanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a\\nchance swift from Estella’s name to the fingers with their knitting\\naction, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this\\nwoman was Estella’s mother.\\n\\nMr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed\\nthe sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said\\nthe subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the\\nwine again, and went on with his dinner.\\n\\nOnly twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the\\nroom was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands\\nwere Estella’s hands, and her eyes were Estella’s eyes, and if she had\\nreappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less\\nsure that my conviction was the truth.\\n\\nIt was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round,\\nquite as a matter of business,—just as he might have drawn his salary\\nwhen that came round,—and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state of\\nperpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine,\\nhis post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office\\nfor its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrong\\ntwin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.\\n\\nWe took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping\\namong Mr. Jaggers’s stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right\\ntwin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down\\nGerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was\\nwalking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had\\nevaporated into the evening air.\\n\\n“Well!” said Wemmick, “that’s over! He’s a wonderful man, without his\\nliving likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine\\nwith him,—and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.”\\n\\nI felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.\\n\\n“Wouldn’t say it to anybody but yourself,” he answered. “I know that\\nwhat is said between you and me goes no further.”\\n\\nI asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham’s adopted daughter, Mrs.\\nBentley Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of\\nthe Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentioned\\nMiss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll\\nof the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.\\n\\n“Wemmick,” said I, “do you remember telling me, before I first went to\\nMr. Jaggers’s private house, to notice that housekeeper?”\\n\\n“Did I?” he replied. “Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,” he added,\\nsuddenly, “I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.”\\n\\n“A wild beast tamed, you called her.”\\n\\n“And what do _you_ call her?”\\n\\n“The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?”\\n\\n“That’s his secret. She has been with him many a long year.”\\n\\n“I wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in\\nbeing acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me\\ngoes no further.”\\n\\n“Well!” Wemmick replied, “I don’t know her story,—that is, I don’t know\\nall of it. But what I do know I’ll tell you. We are in our private and\\npersonal capacities, of course.”\\n\\n“Of course.”\\n\\n“A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for\\nmurder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I\\nbelieve had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it\\nwas up, as you may suppose.”\\n\\n“But she was acquitted.”\\n\\n“Mr. Jaggers was for her,” pursued Wemmick, with a look full of\\nmeaning, “and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a\\ndesperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and\\nhe worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to\\nhave made him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day\\nfor many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial\\nwhere he couldn’t work it himself, sat under counsel, and—every one\\nknew—put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,—a\\nwoman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.\\nIt was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman\\nin Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick\\n(as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of\\njealousy. The murdered woman,—more a match for the man, certainly, in\\npoint of years—was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had\\nbeen a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched\\nand torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now,\\nthere was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this\\nwoman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.\\nJaggers principally rested his case. You may be sure,” said Wemmick,\\ntouching me on the sleeve, “that he never dwelt upon the strength of\\nher hands then, though he sometimes does now.”\\n\\nI had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner\\nparty.\\n\\n“Well, sir!” Wemmick went on; “it happened—happened, don’t you\\nsee?—that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her\\napprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in\\nparticular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully\\ncontrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a\\nbruise or two about her,—nothing for a tramp,—but the backs of her\\nhands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?\\nNow, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of\\nbrambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not\\nhave got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles\\nwere actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the\\nfact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have\\nbeen broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little\\nspots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made\\nwas this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that\\nshe was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the\\nmurder, frantically destroyed her child by this man—some three years\\nold—to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:\\n“We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and\\nwe show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and\\nyou set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept\\nall consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have\\ndestroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have\\nscratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder\\nof her child; why don’t you? As to this case, if you _will_ have\\nscratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted\\nfor them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented\\nthem?” “To sum up, sir,” said Wemmick, “Mr. Jaggers was altogether too\\nmany for the jury, and they gave in.”\\n\\n“Has she been in his service ever since?”\\n\\n“Yes; but not only that,” said Wemmick, “she went into his service\\nimmediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since\\nbeen taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was\\ntamed from the beginning.”\\n\\n“Do you remember the sex of the child?”\\n\\n“Said to have been a girl.”\\n\\n“You have nothing more to say to me to-night?”\\n\\n“Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.”\\n\\nWe exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for\\nmy thoughts, though with no relief from the old.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XLIX.\\n\\n\\nPutting Miss Havisham’s note in my pocket, that it might serve as my\\ncredentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her\\nwaywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I\\nwent down again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway\\nHouse, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for\\nI sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to\\nleave it in the same manner.\\n\\nThe best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet\\nechoing courts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old\\nmonks had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong\\nwalls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables,\\nwere almost as silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral\\nchimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried\\non avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell\\nof the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the\\nrooks, as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high\\ntrees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was\\nchanged, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.\\n\\nAn elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who\\nlived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the\\ngate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,\\nand I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was\\nnot in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing.\\nLooking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on\\nthe hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the\\ncontemplation of, the ashy fire.\\n\\nDoing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old\\nchimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. There\\nwas an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me to\\npity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could\\ncharge her with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in\\nthe progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked\\nfortunes of that house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said in\\na low voice, “Is it real?”\\n\\n“It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost\\nno time.”\\n\\n“Thank you. Thank you.”\\n\\nAs I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I\\nremarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.\\n\\n“I want,” she said, “to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when\\nyou were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But\\nperhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my\\nheart?”\\n\\nWhen I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous\\nright hand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it\\nagain before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.\\n\\n“You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do\\nsomething useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it\\nnot?”\\n\\n“Something that I would like done very much.”\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\nI began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had\\nnot got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking\\nin a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be\\nso; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed\\nthat she was conscious of the fact.\\n\\n“Do you break off,” she asked then, with her former air of being afraid\\nof me, “because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?”\\n\\n“No, no,” I answered, “how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped\\nbecause I thought you were not following what I said.”\\n\\n“Perhaps I was not,” she answered, putting a hand to her head. “Begin\\nagain, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.”\\n\\nShe set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was\\nhabitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of\\nforcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her\\nhow I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how in\\nthis I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)\\ninvolved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they\\nwere the weighty secrets of another.\\n\\n“So!” said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. “And\\nhow much money is wanting to complete the purchase?”\\n\\nI was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. “Nine\\nhundred pounds.”\\n\\n“If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as\\nyou have kept your own?”\\n\\n“Quite as faithfully.”\\n\\n“And your mind will be more at rest?”\\n\\n“Much more at rest.”\\n\\n“Are you very unhappy now?”\\n\\nShe asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an\\nunwonted tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my\\nvoice failed me. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and\\nsoftly laid her forehead on it.\\n\\n“I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of\\ndisquiet than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.”\\n\\nAfter a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire\\nagain.\\n\\n“It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of\\nunhappiness. Is it true?”\\n\\n“Too true.”\\n\\n“Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as\\ndone, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?”\\n\\n“Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the\\ntone of the question. But there is nothing.”\\n\\nShe presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room\\nfor the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her\\npocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and\\nwrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung\\nfrom her neck.\\n\\n“You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?”\\n\\n“Quite. I dined with him yesterday.”\\n\\n“This is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your\\nirresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if\\nyou would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it\\nto you.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving\\nit from him.”\\n\\nShe read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and\\nevidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the\\nreceipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled\\nagain, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the\\npencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without\\nlooking at me.\\n\\n“My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, “I\\nforgive her,” though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do\\nit!”\\n\\n“O Miss Havisham,” said I, “I can do it now. There have been sore\\nmistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want\\nforgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.”\\n\\nShe turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,\\nand, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees\\nat my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,\\nwhen her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have\\nbeen raised to heaven from her mother’s side.\\n\\nTo see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet\\ngave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got\\nmy arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of\\nmine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and\\nwept. I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that\\nthe relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was\\nnot kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.\\n\\n“O!” she cried, despairingly. “What have I done! What have I done!”\\n\\n“If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me\\nanswer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances.\\nIs she married?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nIt was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house\\nhad told me so.\\n\\n“What have I done! What have I done!” She wrung her hands, and crushed\\nher white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. “What\\nhave I done!”\\n\\nI knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a\\ngrievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form\\nthat her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found\\nvengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light of\\nday, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had\\nsecluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,\\nher mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and\\nmust and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew\\nequally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her\\npunishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this\\nearth on which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become\\na master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse,\\nthe vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been\\ncurses in this world?\\n\\n“Until you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a\\nlooking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know\\nwhat I had done. What have I done! What have I done!” And so again,\\ntwenty, fifty times over, What had she done!\\n\\n“Miss Havisham,” I said, when her cry had died away, “you may dismiss\\nme from your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and\\nif you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a\\npart of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that\\nthan to bemoan the past through a hundred years.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip—my dear!” There was an earnest womanly\\ncompassion for me in her new affection. “My dear! Believe this: when\\nshe first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At\\nfirst, I meant no more.”\\n\\n“Well, well!” said I. “I hope so.”\\n\\n“But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did\\nworse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,\\nand with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and\\npoint my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.”\\n\\n“Better,” I could not help saying, “to have left her a natural heart,\\neven to be bruised or broken.”\\n\\nWith that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and\\nthen burst out again, What had she done!\\n\\n“If you knew all my story,” she pleaded, “you would have some\\ncompassion for me and a better understanding of me.”\\n\\n“Miss Havisham,” I answered, as delicately as I could, “I believe I may\\nsay that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first\\nleft this neighbourhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration,\\nand I hope I understand it and its influences. Does what has passed\\nbetween us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to\\nEstella? Not as she is, but as she was when she first came here?”\\n\\nShe was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, and\\nher head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this, and\\nreplied, “Go on.”\\n\\n“Whose child was Estella?”\\n\\nShe shook her head.\\n\\n“You don’t know?”\\n\\nShe shook her head again.\\n\\n“But Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?”\\n\\n“Brought her here.”\\n\\n“Will you tell me how that came about?”\\n\\nShe answered in a low whisper and with caution: “I had been shut up in\\nthese rooms a long time (I don’t know how long; you know what time the\\nclocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear\\nand love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent for\\nhim to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in the\\nnewspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he would\\nlook about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her here\\nasleep, and I called her Estella.”\\n\\n“Might I ask her age then?”\\n\\n“Two or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an\\norphan and I adopted her.”\\n\\nSo convinced I was of that woman’s being her mother, that I wanted no\\nevidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I\\nthought, the connection here was clear and straight.\\n\\nWhat more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had\\nsucceeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew\\nof Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind. No\\nmatter with what other words we parted; we parted.\\n\\nTwilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I\\ncalled to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I\\nwould not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before\\nleaving. For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again,\\nand I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.\\n\\nBy the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which\\nthe rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and\\nleaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on\\nend, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by\\nthe corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the\\npaths where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary\\nall!\\n\\nTaking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little\\ndoor at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at\\nthe opposite door,—not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started\\nand swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was\\nencumbered with a growth of fungus,—when I turned my head to look back.\\nA childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of\\nthe slight action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to\\nthe beam. So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam\\nshuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,—though to be\\nsure I was there in an instant.\\n\\nThe mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this\\nillusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an\\nindescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I\\nhad once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on\\ninto the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let\\nme out at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go\\nupstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I\\nhad left her. I took the latter course and went up.\\n\\nI looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in\\nthe ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back\\ntowards me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly\\naway, I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw\\nher running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about\\nher, and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.\\n\\nI had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.\\nThat I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over\\nher; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same\\npurpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst,\\nand all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the\\nground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered\\nher, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,—that this\\noccurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or\\nthought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the\\nfloor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were\\nfloating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded\\nbridal dress.\\n\\nThen, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running\\naway over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries\\nat the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like\\na prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or\\nwhy we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the\\nflames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her\\ngarments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.\\n\\nShe was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even\\ntouched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if I\\nunreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the fire\\nwould break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon’s\\ncoming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my\\nhands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of\\nfeeling.\\n\\nOn examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,\\nbut that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay\\nmainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon’s directions, her bed was\\ncarried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to\\nbe well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again,\\nan hour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her\\nstick, and had heard her say that she would lie one day.\\n\\nThough every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she still\\nhad something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had\\ncovered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with a\\nwhite sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that\\nhad been and was changed was still upon her.\\n\\nI found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I\\ngot a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next\\npost. Miss Havisham’s family I took upon myself; intending to\\ncommunicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as he\\nliked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert,\\nas soon as I returned to town.\\n\\nThere was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had\\nhappened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she\\nbegan to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that\\nshe said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, “What have I done!”\\nAnd then, “When she first came, I meant to save her from misery like\\nmine.” And then, “Take the pencil and write under my name, ‘I forgive\\nher!’” She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she\\nsometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in\\nanother word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.\\n\\nAs I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that\\npressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could\\nnot drive out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I\\nwould return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and\\nbeing taken up clear of the town. At about six o’clock of the morning,\\ntherefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just as\\nthey said, not stopping for being touched, “Take the pencil and write\\nunder my name, ‘I forgive her.’”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter L.\\n\\n\\nMy hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in\\nthe morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less\\nseverely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames\\nhad set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My\\nright hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It\\nwas bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand\\nand arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like\\na cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck. My hair had\\nbeen caught by the fire, but not my head or face.\\n\\nWhen Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father, he came\\nback to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me. He\\nwas the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages,\\nand steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put\\nthem on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful\\nfor.\\n\\nAt first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I\\nmight say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the\\nflames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I dozed\\nfor a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham’s cries, and by her\\nrunning at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain of\\nthe mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I\\nsuffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention\\nengaged.\\n\\nNeither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. That was\\nmade apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our\\nagreeing—without agreement—to make my recovery of the use of my hands a\\nquestion of so many hours, not of so many weeks.\\n\\nMy first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all\\nwas well down the river? As he replied in the affirmative, with perfect\\nconfidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the\\nday was wearing away. But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more\\nby the light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to it\\nspontaneously.\\n\\n“I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.”\\n\\n“Where was Clara?”\\n\\n“Dear little thing!” said Herbert. “She was up and down with\\nGruffandgrim all the evening. He was perpetually pegging at the floor\\nthe moment she left his sight. I doubt if he can hold out long, though.\\nWhat with rum and pepper,—and pepper and rum,—I should think his\\npegging must be nearly over.”\\n\\n“And then you will be married, Herbert?”\\n\\n“How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?—Lay your arm out upon\\nthe back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I’ll sit down here, and get the\\nbandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes. I was\\nspeaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, he improves?”\\n\\n“I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him.”\\n\\n“So you did. And so he is. He was very communicative last night, and\\ntold me more of his life. You remember his breaking off here about some\\nwoman that he had had great trouble with.—Did I hurt you?”\\n\\nI had started, but not under his touch. His words had given me a start.\\n\\n“I had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it.”\\n\\n“Well! He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.\\nShall I tell you? Or would it worry you just now?”\\n\\n“Tell me by all means. Every word.”\\n\\nHerbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been\\nrather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for.\\n“Your head is cool?” he said, touching it.\\n\\n“Quite,” said I. “Tell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.”\\n\\n“It seems,” said Herbert, “—there’s a bandage off most charmingly, and\\nnow comes the cool one,—makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow,\\ndon’t it? but it will be comfortable presently,—it seems that the woman\\nwas a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman;\\nrevengeful, Handel, to the last degree.”\\n\\n“To what last degree?”\\n\\n“Murder.—Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?”\\n\\n“I don’t feel it. How did she murder? Whom did she murder?”\\n\\n“Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,” said\\nHerbert, “but, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended her, and\\nthe reputation of that defence first made his name known to Provis. It\\nwas another and a stronger woman who was the victim, and there had been\\na struggle—in a barn. Who began it, or how fair it was, or how unfair,\\nmay be doubtful; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful, for the\\nvictim was found throttled.”\\n\\n“Was the woman brought in guilty?”\\n\\n“No; she was acquitted.—My poor Handel, I hurt you!”\\n\\n“It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?”\\n\\n“This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a little\\nchild of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very\\nnight when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the\\nyoung woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore\\nthat she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he\\nshould never see it again; then she vanished.—There’s the worst arm\\ncomfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right\\nhand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light than\\nby a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don’t see the poor\\nblistered patches too distinctly.—You don’t think your breathing is\\naffected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly.”\\n\\n“Perhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?”\\n\\n“There comes the darkest part of Provis’s life. She did.”\\n\\n“That is, he says she did.”\\n\\n“Why, of course, my dear boy,” returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,\\nand again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. “He says it all.\\nI have no other information.”\\n\\n“No, to be sure.”\\n\\n“Now, whether,” pursued Herbert, “he had used the child’s mother ill,\\nor whether he had used the child’s mother well, Provis doesn’t say; but\\nshe had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he\\ndescribed to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for\\nher, and forbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he should be\\ncalled upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause\\nof her death, he hid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept\\nhimself dark, as he says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was\\nonly vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the\\njealousy arose. After the acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost\\nthe child and the child’s mother.”\\n\\n“I want to ask—”\\n\\n“A moment, my dear boy, and I have done. That evil genius, Compeyson,\\nthe worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of his keeping\\nout of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so, of course\\nafterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him\\npoorer and working him harder. It was clear last night that this barbed\\nthe point of Provis’s animosity.”\\n\\n“I want to know,” said I, “and particularly, Herbert, whether he told\\nyou when this happened?”\\n\\n“Particularly? Let me remember, then, what he said as to that. His\\nexpression was, ‘a round score o’ year ago, and a’most directly after I\\ntook up wi’ Compeyson.’ How old were you when you came upon him in the\\nlittle churchyard?”\\n\\n“I think in my seventh year.”\\n\\n“Ay. It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and you\\nbrought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would\\nhave been about your age.”\\n\\n“Herbert,” said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, “can you\\nsee me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?”\\n\\n“By the firelight,” answered Herbert, coming close again.\\n\\n“Look at me.”\\n\\n“I do look at you, my dear boy.”\\n\\n“Touch me.”\\n\\n“I do touch you, my dear boy.”\\n\\n“You are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much\\ndisordered by the accident of last night?”\\n\\n“N-no, my dear boy,” said Herbert, after taking time to examine me.\\n“You are rather excited, but you are quite yourself.”\\n\\n“I know I am quite myself. And the man we have in hiding down the\\nriver, is Estella’s Father.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter LI.\\n\\n\\nWhat purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving\\nEstella’s parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the\\nquestion was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before\\nme by a wiser head than my own.\\n\\nBut when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was\\nseized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter\\ndown,—that I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr.\\nJaggers, and come at the bare truth. I really do not know whether I\\nfelt that I did this for Estella’s sake, or whether I was glad to\\ntransfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned some\\nrays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me. Perhaps\\nthe latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth.\\n\\nAny way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street\\nthat night. Herbert’s representations that, if I did, I should probably\\nbe laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive’s safety would\\ndepend upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding,\\nagain and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr.\\nJaggers to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my\\nhurts looked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out\\ntogether, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left\\nHerbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.\\n\\nThere were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over\\nthe office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things\\nstraight. On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers into\\nMr. Jaggers’s room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the\\nouter office. Finding such clerk on Wemmick’s post that morning, I knew\\nwhat was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick\\ntogether, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to\\ncompromise him.\\n\\nMy appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my\\nshoulders, favoured my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief\\naccount of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to\\ngive him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused\\nour talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the\\nrules of evidence, than it had been before. While I described the\\ndisaster, Mr. Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire.\\nWemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the\\npockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post.\\nThe two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official\\nproceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn’t\\nsmell fire at the present moment.\\n\\nMy narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced\\nMiss Havisham’s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for\\nHerbert. Mr. Jaggers’s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when\\nI handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,\\nwith instructions to draw the check for his signature. While that was\\nin course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.\\nJaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked\\non at me. “I am sorry, Pip,” said he, as I put the check in my pocket,\\nwhen he had signed it, “that we do nothing for _you_.”\\n\\n“Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me,” I returned, “whether she\\ncould do nothing for me, and I told her No.”\\n\\n“Everybody should know his own business,” said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw\\nWemmick’s lips form the words “portable property.”\\n\\n“I should _not_ have told her No, if I had been you,” said Mr Jaggers;\\n“but every man ought to know his own business best.”\\n\\n“Every man’s business,” said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,\\n“is portable property.”\\n\\nAs I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at\\nheart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:—\\n\\n“I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to\\ngive me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave\\nme all she possessed.”\\n\\n“Did she?” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and\\nthen straightening himself. “Hah! I don’t think I should have done so,\\nif I had been Miss Havisham. But _she_ ought to know her own business\\nbest.”\\n\\n“I know more of the history of Miss Havisham’s adopted child than Miss\\nHavisham herself does, sir. I know her mother.”\\n\\nMr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated “Mother?”\\n\\n“I have seen her mother within these three days.”\\n\\n“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.\\n\\n“And so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently.”\\n\\n“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.\\n\\n“Perhaps I know more of Estella’s history than even you do,” said I. “I\\nknow her father too.”\\n\\nA certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner—he was too\\nself-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being\\nbrought to an indefinably attentive stop—assured me that he did not\\nknow who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis’s\\naccount (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;\\nwhich I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers’s\\nclient until some four years later, and when he could have no reason\\nfor claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this\\nunconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers’s part before, though I was quite sure\\nof it now.\\n\\n“So! You know the young lady’s father, Pip?” said Mr. Jaggers.\\n\\n“Yes,” I replied, “and his name is Provis—from New South Wales.”\\n\\nEven Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest\\nstart that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the\\nsooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the\\naction of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the\\nannouncement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just\\nthen, lest Mr. Jaggers’s sharpness should detect that there had been\\nsome communication unknown to him between us.\\n\\n“And on what evidence, Pip,” asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he\\npaused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, “does Provis make\\nthis claim?”\\n\\n“He does not make it,” said I, “and has never made it, and has no\\nknowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.”\\n\\nFor once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so\\nunexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket\\nwithout completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked\\nwith stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.\\n\\nThen I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation\\nthat I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact\\nknew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look\\ntowards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been\\nfor some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers’s look. When I did at last\\nturn my eyes in Wemmick’s direction, I found that he had unposted his\\npen, and was intent upon the table before him.\\n\\n“Hah!” said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the\\ntable. “What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?”\\n\\nBut I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a\\npassionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and\\nmanly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had\\nlapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had\\nmade: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I\\nrepresented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence\\nfrom him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said\\nthat I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted\\nassurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,\\nand why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he\\ncared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,\\nand that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,\\nwhatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything\\nelse in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and\\nsilent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to\\nWemmick, and said, “Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle\\nheart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the\\ninnocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business\\nlife. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to\\nrepresent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be\\nmore open with me!”\\n\\nI have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.\\nJaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving\\ncrossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his\\nemployment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something\\nlike a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.\\n\\n“What’s all this?” said Mr. Jaggers. “You with an old father, and you\\nwith pleasant and playful ways?”\\n\\n“Well!” returned Wemmick. “If I don’t bring ’em here, what does it\\nmatter?”\\n\\n“Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling\\nopenly, “this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.”\\n\\n“Not a bit of it,” returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. “I\\nthink you’re another.”\\n\\nAgain they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still\\ndistrustful that the other was taking him in.\\n\\n“_You_ with a pleasant home?” said Mr. Jaggers.\\n\\n“Since it don’t interfere with business,” returned Wemmick, “let it be\\nso. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn’t wonder if _you_ might be\\nplanning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of\\nthese days, when you’re tired of all this work.”\\n\\nMr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and\\nactually drew a sigh. “Pip,” said he, “we won’t talk about ‘poor\\ndreams;’ you know more about such things than I, having much fresher\\nexperience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I’ll put a\\ncase to you. Mind! I admit nothing.”\\n\\nHe waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly\\nsaid that he admitted nothing.\\n\\n“Now, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “put this case. Put the case that a\\nwoman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child\\nconcealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal\\nadviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to\\nthe latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put\\nthe case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an\\neccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.”\\n\\n“I follow you, sir.”\\n\\n“Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he\\nsaw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain\\ndestruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at\\na criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that\\nhe habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,\\nneglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing\\nup to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw\\nin his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn,\\nto develop into the fish that were to come to his net,—to be\\nprosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.”\\n\\n“I follow you, sir.”\\n\\n“Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the\\nheap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make\\nno stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this\\npower: “I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so,\\nyou did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you\\nthrough it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it\\nshould be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be\\nproduced. Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring\\nyou off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost,\\nyour child is still saved.” Put the case that this was done, and that\\nthe woman was cleared.”\\n\\n“I understand you perfectly.”\\n\\n“But that I make no admissions?”\\n\\n“That you make no admissions.” And Wemmick repeated, “No admissions.”\\n\\n“Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little\\nshaken the woman’s intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,\\nshe was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be\\nsheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the\\nold, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking\\nout, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend\\nthe imaginary case?”\\n\\n“Quite.”\\n\\n“Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That\\nthe mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the\\nmother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many\\nmiles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was\\nstill a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case\\nto yourself very carefully.”\\n\\n“I do.”\\n\\n“I ask Wemmick to put it to _him_self very carefully.”\\n\\nAnd Wemmick said, “I do.”\\n\\n“For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father’s? I think\\nhe would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother’s? I\\nthink if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was. For\\nthe daughter’s? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her\\nparentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to\\ndisgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for\\nlife. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her\\nthe subject of those ‘poor dreams’ which have, at one time or another,\\nbeen in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you\\nthat you had better—and would much sooner when you had thought well of\\nit—chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right\\nhand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut _that_ off\\ntoo.”\\n\\nI looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his\\nlips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.\\n“Now, Wemmick,” said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, “what\\nitem was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?”\\n\\nStanding by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the\\nodd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times:\\nwith this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to\\nsay conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional\\nlight to the other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now\\ninflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and\\nWemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest\\npoint in abeyance for a moment. I had never seen them on such ill\\nterms; for generally they got on very well indeed together.\\n\\nBut they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of\\nMike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on\\nhis sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance\\nwithin those walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or\\nin that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble\\n(which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest\\ndaughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted this\\nmelancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially\\nbefore the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike’s eye\\nhappened to twinkle with a tear.\\n\\n“What are you about?” demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.\\n“What do you come snivelling here for?”\\n\\n“I didn’t go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.”\\n\\n“You did,” said Wemmick. “How dare you? You’re not in a fit state to\\ncome here, if you can’t come here without spluttering like a bad pen.\\nWhat do you mean by it?”\\n\\n“A man can’t help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,” pleaded Mike.\\n\\n“His what?” demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. “Say that again!”\\n\\n“Now look here my man,” said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and\\npointing to the door. “Get out of this office. I’ll have no feelings\\nhere. Get out.”\\n\\n“It serves you right,” said Wemmick, “Get out.”\\n\\nSo, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and\\nWemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and\\nwent to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had\\njust had lunch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter LII.\\n\\n\\nFrom Little Britain I went, with my check in my pocket, to Miss\\nSkiffins’s brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins’s brother, the\\naccountant, going straight to Clarriker’s and bringing Clarriker to me,\\nI had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement. It was the\\nonly good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done,\\nsince I was first apprised of my great expectations.\\n\\nClarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House\\nwere steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish a\\nsmall branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension\\nof the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would\\ngo out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for a\\nseparation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more\\nsettled. And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were loosening\\nits hold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.\\n\\nBut there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home\\nof a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he told\\nme no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara\\nBarley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join\\nthem (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and of our all going up the\\nNile and seeing wonders. Without being sanguine as to my own part in\\nthose bright plans, I felt that Herbert’s way was clearing fast, and\\nthat old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and his\\ndaughter would soon be happily provided for.\\n\\nWe had now got into the month of March. My left arm, though it\\npresented no bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal\\nthat I was still unable to get a coat on. My right arm was tolerably\\nrestored; disfigured, but fairly serviceable.\\n\\nOn a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received\\nthe following letter from Wemmick by the post.\\n\\n“Walworth. Burn this as soon as read. Early in the week, or say\\nWednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try\\nit. Now burn.”\\n\\nWhen I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire—but not\\nbefore we had both got it by heart—we considered what to do. For, of\\ncourse my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.\\n\\n“I have thought it over again and again,” said Herbert, “and I think I\\nknow a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take Startop. A\\ngood fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and\\nhonourable.”\\n\\nI had thought of him more than once.\\n\\n“But how much would you tell him, Herbert?”\\n\\n“It is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a mere\\nfreak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know\\nthat there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away.\\nYou go with him?”\\n\\n“No doubt.”\\n\\n“Where?”\\n\\nIt had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the\\npoint, almost indifferent what port we made for,—Hamburg, Rotterdam,\\nAntwerp,—the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any\\nforeign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do. I\\nhad always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the\\nboat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for\\nsearch or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would\\nleave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get\\ndown the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot\\nuntil we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we\\nlay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we\\nmade inquiries beforehand.\\n\\nHerbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after\\nbreakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for\\nHamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our\\nthoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign\\nsteamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied\\nourselves that we knew the build and colour of each. We then separated\\nfor a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;\\nHerbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do\\nwithout any hindrance, and when we met again at one o’clock reported it\\ndone. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen\\nStartop, and he was more than ready to join.\\n\\nThose two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer;\\nour charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our\\nobject, we should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not\\ncome home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that\\nhe should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he\\nshould prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on\\nWednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the\\narrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and that\\nhe should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him on\\nboard.\\n\\nThese precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.\\n\\nOn opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter\\nin the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though not\\nill-written. It had been delivered by hand (of course, since I left\\nhome), and its contents were these:—\\n\\n“If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow\\nnight at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln,\\nyou had better come. If you want information regarding _your uncle\\nProvis_, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time.\\n_You must come alone_. Bring this with you.”\\n\\nI had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange\\nletter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that I\\nmust decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would\\ntake me down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I could not think of\\ngoing, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. And\\nagain, for anything I knew, the proffered information might have some\\nimportant bearing on the flight itself.\\n\\nIf I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still\\nhave gone. Having hardly any time for consideration,—my watch showing\\nme that the coach started within half an hour,—I resolved to go. I\\nshould certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle\\nProvis. That, coming on Wemmick’s letter and the morning’s busy\\npreparation, turned the scale.\\n\\nIt is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of\\nalmost any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this\\nmysterious epistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be\\nsecret got mechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same\\nmechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling\\nhim that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I\\nhad decided to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss\\nHavisham was faring. I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock\\nup the chambers, and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. If\\nI had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have\\nmissed my aim; going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out\\nof the yard. I was the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep in\\nstraw, when I came to myself.\\n\\nFor I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it\\nhad so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morning\\nhurry and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had\\nwaited for Wemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last. And now\\nI began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt\\nwhether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to consider\\nwhether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue against\\never heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through\\nall those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose\\nvery few hurried people are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis\\nby name mastered everything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already\\nwithout knowing it,—if that be reasoning,—in case any harm should\\nbefall him through my not going, how could I ever forgive myself!\\n\\nIt was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary\\nto me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside\\nin my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of\\nminor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it was\\npreparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she\\nwas still very ill, though considered something better.\\n\\nMy inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I\\ndined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was not able\\nto cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for\\nme. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertain\\nme with my own story,—of course with the popular feature that\\nPumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.\\n\\n“Do you know the young man?” said I.\\n\\n“Know him!” repeated the landlord. “Ever since he was—no height at\\nall.”\\n\\n“Does he ever come back to this neighbourhood?”\\n\\n“Ay, he comes back,” said the landlord, “to his great friends, now and\\nagain, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.”\\n\\n“What man is that?”\\n\\n“Him that I speak of,” said the landlord. “Mr. Pumblechook.”\\n\\n“Is he ungrateful to no one else?”\\n\\n“No doubt he would be, if he could,” returned the landlord, “but he\\ncan’t. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him.”\\n\\n“Does Pumblechook say so?”\\n\\n“Say so!” replied the landlord. “He han’t no call to say so.”\\n\\n“But does he say so?”\\n\\n“It would turn a man’s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of\\nit, sir,” said the landlord.\\n\\nI thought, “Yet Joe, dear Joe, _you_ never tell of it. Long-suffering\\nand loving Joe, _you_ never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!”\\n\\n“Your appetite’s been touched like by your accident,” said the\\nlandlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. “Try a tenderer\\nbit.”\\n\\n“No, thank you,” I replied, turning from the table to brood over the\\nfire. “I can eat no more. Please take it away.”\\n\\nI had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as\\nthrough the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the truer Joe;\\nthe meaner he, the nobler Joe.\\n\\nMy heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the\\nfire for an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but not\\nfrom my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened\\nround my neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for\\nthe letter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it,\\nand was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of\\nthe coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the\\nlittle sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.\\nTowards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter LIII.\\n\\n\\nIt was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed\\nlands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there\\nwas a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large\\nmoon. In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in\\namong the piled mountains of cloud.\\n\\nThere was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A\\nstranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were\\nso oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew\\nthem well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had\\nno excuse for returning, being there. So, having come there against my\\ninclination, I went on against it.\\n\\nThe direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor\\nthat in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towards\\nthe distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old\\nlights away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knew\\nthe limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles\\napart; so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night,\\nthere would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two\\nbright specks.\\n\\nAt first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand\\nstill while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose\\nand blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a little while\\nI seemed to have the whole flats to myself.\\n\\nIt was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was\\nburning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and\\nleft, and no workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. It\\nlay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the\\ntools and barrows that were lying about.\\n\\nComing up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,—for the rude\\npath lay through it,—I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened\\nmy pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,\\nI looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken,\\nand how the house—of wood with a tiled roof—would not be proof against\\nthe weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and\\nooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapour of the kiln\\ncrept in a ghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I\\nknocked again. No answer still, and I tried the latch.\\n\\nIt rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a\\nlighted candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle\\nbedstead. As there was a loft above, I called, “Is there any one here?”\\nbut no voice answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it\\nwas past nine, called again, “Is there any one here?” There being still\\nno answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.\\n\\nIt was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen\\nalready, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the\\nshelter of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was\\nconsidering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be\\ncoming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my head\\nto look if the wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken\\nup the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent\\nshock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in\\na strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.\\n\\n“Now,” said a suppressed voice with an oath, “I’ve got you!”\\n\\n“What is this?” I cried, struggling. “Who is it? Help, help, help!”\\n\\nNot only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on my\\nbad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man’s hand,\\nsometimes a strong man’s breast, was set against my mouth to deaden my\\ncries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled\\nineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. “And\\nnow,” said the suppressed voice with another oath, “call out again, and\\nI’ll make short work of you!”\\n\\nFaint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the\\nsurprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in\\nexecution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.\\nBut, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt\\nbefore, it were now being boiled.\\n\\nThe sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black\\ndarkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.\\nAfter groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he\\nwanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the\\nsparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and\\nbreathed, match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue\\npoint of the match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,—no\\nwonder there,—and one after another the sparks died out.\\n\\nThe man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As\\nthe sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, and\\ntouches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending\\nover the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,\\nbreathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and\\nshowed me Orlick.\\n\\nWhom I had looked for, I don’t know. I had not looked for him. Seeing\\nhim, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes\\nupon him.\\n\\nHe lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,\\nand dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away\\nfrom him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms\\nfolded on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to\\na stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,—a fixture\\nthere,—the means of ascent to the loft above.\\n\\n“Now,” said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, “I’ve\\ngot you.”\\n\\n“Unbind me. Let me go!”\\n\\n“Ah!” he returned, “_I_’ll let you go. I’ll let you go to the moon,\\nI’ll let you go to the stars. All in good time.”\\n\\n“Why have you lured me here?”\\n\\n“Don’t you know?” said he, with a deadly look.\\n\\n“Why have you set upon me in the dark?”\\n\\n“Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than\\ntwo. O you enemy, you enemy!”\\n\\nHis enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms\\nfolded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a\\nmalignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence, he\\nput his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a\\nbrass-bound stock.\\n\\n“Do you know this?” said he, making as if he would take aim at me. “Do\\nyou know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!”\\n\\n“Yes,” I answered.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“You cost me that place. You did. Speak!”\\n\\n“What else could I do?”\\n\\n“You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to\\ncome betwixt me and a young woman I liked?”\\n\\n“When did I?”\\n\\n“When didn’t you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to\\nher.”\\n\\n“You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done\\nyou no harm, if you had done yourself none.”\\n\\n“You’re a liar. And you’ll take any pains, and spend any money, to\\ndrive me out of this country, will you?” said he, repeating my words to\\nBiddy in the last interview I had with her. “Now, I’ll tell you a piece\\nof information. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of\\nthis country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty\\ntimes told, to the last brass farden!” As he shook his heavy hand at\\nme, with his mouth snarling like a tiger’s, I felt that it was true.\\n\\n“What are you going to do to me?”\\n\\n“I’m a-going,” said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a\\nheavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,—“I’m\\na-going to have your life!”\\n\\nHe leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it\\nacross his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.\\n\\n“You was always in Old Orlick’s way since ever you was a child. You\\ngoes out of his way this present night. He’ll have no more on you.\\nYou’re dead.”\\n\\nI felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked\\nwildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.\\n\\n“More than that,” said he, folding his arms on the table again, “I\\nwon’t have a rag of you, I won’t have a bone of you, left on earth.\\nI’ll put your body in the kiln,—I’d carry two such to it, on my\\nshoulders—and, let people suppose what they may of you, they shall\\nnever know nothing.”\\n\\nMy mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences\\nof such a death. Estella’s father would believe I had deserted him,\\nwould be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,\\nwhen he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had\\ncalled at Miss Havisham’s gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would\\nnever know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what I\\nhad suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed\\nthrough. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible\\nthan death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And so\\nquick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn\\ngenerations,—Estella’s children, and their children,—while the wretch’s\\nwords were yet on his lips.\\n\\n“Now, wolf,” said he, “afore I kill you like any other beast,—which is\\nwot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,—I’ll have a good look\\nat you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!”\\n\\nIt had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though few\\ncould know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the\\nhopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by\\na scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips. Above all things, I\\nresolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some\\nlast poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of\\nmen were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of\\nHeaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no\\nfarewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to\\nme, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my\\nmiserable errors,—still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I\\nwould have done it.\\n\\nHe had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. Around his\\nneck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drink\\nslung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, and\\ntook a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw\\nflash into his face.\\n\\n“Wolf!” said he, folding his arms again, “Old Orlick’s a-going to tell\\nyou somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister.”\\n\\nAgain my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted\\nthe whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her\\ndeath, before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.\\n\\n“It was you, villain,” said I.\\n\\n“I tell you it was your doing,—I tell you it was done through you,” he\\nretorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the\\nvacant air between us. “I come upon her from behind, as I come upon you\\nto-night. _I_ giv’ it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been a\\nlimekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn’t have come\\nto life again. But it warn’t Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was\\nfavoured, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?\\nNow you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.”\\n\\nHe drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of the\\nbottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly\\nunderstood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an\\nend of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew\\nthat when I was changed into a part of the vapour that had crept\\ntowards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he\\nwould do as he had done in my sister’s case,—make all haste to the\\ntown, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My\\nrapid mind pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with\\nhim in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and\\nthe white vapour creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.\\n\\nIt was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years\\nwhile he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented\\npictures to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of\\nmy brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons\\nwithout seeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of\\nthese images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him\\nhimself,—who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!—that\\nI knew of the slightest action of his fingers.\\n\\nWhen he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which he\\nsat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the candle, and,\\nshading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me,\\nstood before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.\\n\\n“Wolf, I’ll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled\\nover on your stairs that night.”\\n\\nI saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of\\nthe heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman’s lantern on the wall. I\\nsaw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;\\nthere, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.\\n\\n“And why was Old Orlick there? I’ll tell you something more, wolf. You\\nand her _have_ pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as\\ngetting a easy living in it goes, and I’ve took up with new companions,\\nand new masters. Some of ’em writes my letters when I wants ’em\\nwrote,—do you mind?—writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;\\nthey’re not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I’ve had a firm mind\\nand a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your\\nsister’s burying. I han’t seen a way to get you safe, and I’ve looked\\narter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,\\n‘Somehow or another I’ll have him!’ What! When I looks for you, I finds\\nyour uncle Provis, eh?”\\n\\nMill Pond Bank, and Chinks’s Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,\\nall so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was\\nover, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his\\nback, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running\\nout to sea!\\n\\n“_You_ with a uncle too! Why, I know’d you at Gargery’s when you was so\\nsmall a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and\\nthumb and chucked you away dead (as I’d thoughts o’ doing, odd times,\\nwhen I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you\\nhadn’t found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for\\nto hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old\\nOrlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year\\nago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like a\\nbullock, as he means to drop you—hey?—when he come for to hear\\nthat—hey?”\\n\\nIn his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I\\nturned my face aside to save it from the flame.\\n\\n“Ah!” he cried, laughing, after doing it again, “the burnt child dreads\\nthe fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was\\nsmuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick’s a match for you and\\nknow’d you’d come to-night! Now I’ll tell you something more, wolf, and\\nthis ends it. There’s them that’s as good a match for your uncle Provis\\nas Old Orlick has been for you. Let him ’ware them, when he’s lost his\\nnevvy! Let him ’ware them, when no man can’t find a rag of his dear\\nrelation’s clothes, nor yet a bone of his body. There’s them that can’t\\nand that won’t have Magwitch,—yes, _I_ know the name!—alive in the same\\nland with them, and that’s had such sure information of him when he was\\nalive in another land, as that he couldn’t and shouldn’t leave it\\nunbeknown and put them in danger. P’raps it’s them that writes fifty\\nhands, and that’s not like sneaking you as writes but one. ’Ware\\nCompeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!”\\n\\nHe flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an\\ninstant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the\\nlight on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and\\nBiddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.\\n\\nThere was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the\\nopposite wall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and\\nforwards. His great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever\\nbefore, as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his\\nsides, and with his eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left.\\nWild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures\\nthat rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand\\nthat, unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely\\nperishing out of all human knowledge, he would never have told me what\\nhe had told.\\n\\nOf a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed it\\naway. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowed\\nslowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked\\nat me no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of\\nhis hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and\\nswearing horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw\\nin his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.\\n\\nThe resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering one\\nvain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and\\nstruggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I\\ncould move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until\\nthen unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard\\nresponsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the\\ndoor, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of\\nmen, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly\\nout into the night.\\n\\nAfter a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the\\nsame place, with my head on some one’s knee. My eyes were fixed on the\\nladder against the wall, when I came to myself,—had opened on it before\\nmy mind saw it,—and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I\\nwas in the place where I had lost it.\\n\\nToo indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who\\nsupported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came\\nbetween me and it a face. The face of Trabb’s boy!\\n\\n“I think he’s all right!” said Trabb’s boy, in a sober voice; “but\\nain’t he just pale though!”\\n\\nAt these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,\\nand I saw my supporter to be—\\n\\n“Herbert! Great Heaven!”\\n\\n“Softly,” said Herbert. “Gently, Handel. Don’t be too eager.”\\n\\n“And our old comrade, Startop!” I cried, as he too bent over me.\\n\\n“Remember what he is going to assist us in,” said Herbert, “and be\\ncalm.”\\n\\nThe allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in\\nmy arm. “The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is\\nto-night? How long have I been here?” For, I had a strange and strong\\nmisgiving that I had been lying there a long time—a day and a\\nnight,—two days and nights,—more.\\n\\n“The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.”\\n\\n“Thank God!”\\n\\n“And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,” said Herbert. “But\\nyou can’t help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can\\nyou stand?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said I, “I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing\\narm.”\\n\\nThey laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen\\nand inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they\\ntore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully\\nreplaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain\\nsome cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the\\ndoor of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the\\nquarry on our way back. Trabb’s boy—Trabb’s overgrown young man\\nnow—went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come\\nin at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I\\nhad last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter.\\nThe white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as\\nI had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.\\n\\nEntreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,—which at\\nfirst he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining\\nquiet,—I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our\\nchambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had\\nmet in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was\\ngone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the\\ninconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His\\nuneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an\\nhour’s consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who\\nvolunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.\\nFinding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his\\nuneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he\\nresolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the\\nBlue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,\\nfinding neither, went on to Miss Havisham’s, where they lost me.\\nHereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when\\nI was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh\\nthemselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.\\nAmong the loungers under the Boar’s archway happened to be Trabb’s\\nBoy,—true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he\\nhad no business,—and Trabb’s boy had seen me passing from Miss\\nHavisham’s in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb’s boy became\\ntheir guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by\\nthe town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went\\nalong, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought\\nthere on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis’s\\nsafety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be\\nmischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and\\nwent on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,\\nendeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could\\nhear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was\\nwhile my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I\\nwas there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,\\nand rushed in, closely followed by the other two.\\n\\nWhen I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our\\nimmediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it\\nwas, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such\\na course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be\\nfatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we\\nrelinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the\\npresent, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather\\nlight of the matter to Trabb’s boy; who, I am convinced, would have\\nbeen much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his\\nintervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb’s boy was of a\\nmalignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it\\nwas in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody’s\\nexpense. When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed\\nto meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an\\nill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).\\n\\nWednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London\\nthat night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be\\nclear away before the night’s adventure began to be talked of. Herbert\\ngot a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this\\nstuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear\\nits pain on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple,\\nand I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.\\n\\nMy terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for\\nto-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of\\nitself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the\\nmental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon\\nme that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with\\nsuch consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.\\n\\nNo precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from\\ncommunication with him that day; yet this again increased my\\nrestlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing\\nthat he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me\\nso. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was\\nsomething more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the\\nfact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days\\nwore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,\\nmy overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow\\nmorning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning\\nhead throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to\\nhigh numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew\\nin prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a\\nfatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to\\nmyself with a start, “Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!”\\n\\nThey kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed,\\nand gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the\\nnotion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and\\nthe opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed\\nand went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for\\nfour-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last\\nself-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept\\nsoundly.\\n\\nWednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking\\nlights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a\\nmarsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was\\nspanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey, with here and there\\nat top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along the\\nclustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the\\nunusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn\\nfrom the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.\\nFrom me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.\\n\\nHerbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on\\nthe sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the\\nfire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In\\ngood time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the\\nsharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still\\nflowing towards us.\\n\\n“When it turns at nine o’clock,” said Herbert, cheerfully, “look out\\nfor us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter LIV.\\n\\n\\nIt was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind\\nblows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade. We\\nhad our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly\\npossessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the\\nbag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were\\nquestions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for\\nit was wholly set on Provis’s safety. I only wondered for the passing\\nmoment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered\\ncircumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.\\n\\nWe loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if\\nwe were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had\\ntaken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After\\na little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two\\nor three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went\\non board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then\\nabout high-water,—half-past eight.\\n\\nOur plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being\\nwith us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,\\nand row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long\\nreaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is\\nbroad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and\\nwhere lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we\\ncould choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all\\nnight. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would\\nstart from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at\\nwhat time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail\\nthe first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we\\nshould have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each\\nvessel.\\n\\nThe relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was\\nso great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition in\\nwhich I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the\\nmovement on the river, and the moving river itself,—the road that ran\\nwith us, seeming to sympathise with us, animate us, and encourage us\\non,—freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use\\nin the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends,\\nand they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.\\n\\nAt that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present\\nextent, and watermen’s boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing\\ncolliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now; but\\nof steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part so\\nmany. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and\\nthere that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;\\nthe navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a\\nmuch easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and\\nwe went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.\\n\\nOld London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its\\noyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor’s Gate, and\\nwe were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,\\nand Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking\\nimmensely high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were\\ncolliers by the score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off\\nstages on deck, as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up,\\nwhich were then rattled over the side into barges; here, at her\\nmoorings was to-morrow’s steamer for Rotterdam, of which we took good\\nnotice; and here to-morrow’s for Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we\\ncrossed. And now I, sitting in the stern, could see, with a faster\\nbeating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs.\\n\\n“Is he there?” said Herbert.\\n\\n“Not yet.”\\n\\n“Right! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see his\\nsignal?”\\n\\n“Not well from here; but I think I see it.—Now I see him! Pull both.\\nEasy, Herbert. Oars!”\\n\\nWe touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board,\\nand we were off again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvas\\nbag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.\\n\\n“Dear boy!” he said, putting his arm on my shoulder, as he took his\\nseat. “Faithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!”\\n\\nAgain among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty\\nchain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the\\nmoment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood and\\nshaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the\\nfigure-head of the _John of Sunderland_ making a speech to the winds\\n(as is done by many Johns), and the _Betsy of Yarmouth_ with a firm\\nformality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her\\nhead; in and out, hammers going in ship-builders’ yards, saws going at\\ntimber, clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky\\nships, capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible\\nsea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent\\nlightermen, in and out,—out at last upon the clearer river, where the\\nships’ boys might take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled\\nwaters with them over the side, and where the festooned sails might fly\\nout to the wind.\\n\\nAt the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had\\nlooked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We\\ncertainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not\\neither attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by\\nany boat, I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on,\\nor to make her purpose evident. But we held our own without any\\nappearance of molestation.\\n\\nHe had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural\\npart of the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he\\nhad led accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us.\\nHe was not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his\\ngentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not\\ndisposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had no\\nnotion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confronted\\nit, but it must come before he troubled himself.\\n\\n“If you knowed, dear boy,” he said to me, “what it is to sit here\\nalonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day\\nbetwixt four walls, you’d envy me. But you don’t know what it is.”\\n\\n“I think I know the delights of freedom,” I answered.\\n\\n“Ah,” said he, shaking his head gravely. “But you don’t know it equal\\nto me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it\\nequal to me,—but I ain’t a-going to be low.”\\n\\nIt occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he\\nshould have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected\\nthat perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the\\nhabit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I\\nwas not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:—\\n\\n“You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t’other side the world, I\\nwas always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for\\nall I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could\\ncome, and Magwitch could go, and nobody’s head would be troubled about\\nhim. They ain’t so easy concerning me here, dear boy,—wouldn’t be,\\nleastwise, if they knowed where I was.”\\n\\n“If all goes well,” said I, “you will be perfectly free and safe again\\nwithin a few hours.”\\n\\n“Well,” he returned, drawing a long breath, “I hope so.”\\n\\n“And think so?”\\n\\nHe dipped his hand in the water over the boat’s gunwale, and said,\\nsmiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:—\\n\\n“Ay, I s’pose I think so, dear boy. We’d be puzzled to be more quiet\\nand easy-going than we are at present. But—it’s a flowing so soft and\\npleasant through the water, p’raps, as makes me think it—I was a\\nthinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the\\nbottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this\\nriver what I catches hold of. Nor yet we can’t no more hold their tide\\nthan I can hold this. And it’s run through my fingers and gone, you\\nsee!” holding up his dripping hand.\\n\\n“But for your face I should think you were a little despondent,” said\\nI.\\n\\n“Not a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of\\nthat there rippling at the boat’s head making a sort of a Sunday tune.\\nMaybe I’m a growing a trifle old besides.”\\n\\nHe put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of\\nface, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of\\nEngland. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been\\nin constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer\\ninto the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he\\nwould be safest where he was, and he said. “Do you, dear boy?” and\\nquietly sat down again.\\n\\nThe air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the\\nsunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose\\nnone of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By\\nimperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of\\nthe nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the\\nmuddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend.\\nAs our charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a\\nboat or two’s length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch\\nthe stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a\\nlarge transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And\\nsoon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,\\nand presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking\\nadvantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us\\nin a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of\\nthe tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and\\nmudbanks.\\n\\nOur oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drive\\nwith the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour’s rest\\nproved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery\\nstones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about. It\\nwas like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dim\\nhorizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great\\nfloating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed\\nstranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round\\nthe last low point we had headed; and the last green barge,\\nstraw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed; and some\\nballast-lighters, shaped like a child’s first rude imitation of a boat,\\nlay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles\\nstood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes\\nstuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud, and red\\nlandmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old landing-stage\\nand an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and all about us was\\nstagnation and mud.\\n\\nWe pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder\\nwork now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and\\nrowed until the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a\\nlittle, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on\\nthe low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into\\nblack; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were\\nthe rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life,\\nsave here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.\\n\\nAs the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,\\nwould not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for\\nclearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could\\nfind. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for\\nanything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or\\nfive dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with\\nher galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.\\nThe night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and\\nwhat light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as\\nthe oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.\\n\\nAt this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we\\nwere followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular\\nintervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or\\nother of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and\\nthere, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little\\ncreek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them\\nnervously. Sometimes, “What was that ripple?” one of us would say in a\\nlow voice. Or another, “Is that a boat yonder?” And afterwards we would\\nfall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with\\nwhat an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.\\n\\nAt length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran\\nalongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard\\nby. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light\\nto be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I\\ndare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good\\nfire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various\\nliquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,—“such as\\nthey were,” the landlord said. No other company was in the house than\\nthe landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the “Jack” of the\\nlittle causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been\\nlow-water mark too.\\n\\nWith this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came\\nashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all\\nelse, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the\\nkitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop\\nwere to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as\\ncarefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there\\nwere more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have\\nthought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,\\nnotwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.\\n\\nWhile we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the\\nJack—who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes\\non, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as\\ninteresting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a\\ndrowned seaman washed ashore—asked me if we had seen a four-oared\\ngalley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he said she must\\nhave gone down then, and yet she “took up too,” when she left there.\\n\\n“They must ha’ thought better on’t for some reason or another,” said\\nthe Jack, “and gone down.”\\n\\n“A four-oared galley, did you say?” said I.\\n\\n“A four,” said the Jack, “and two sitters.”\\n\\n“Did they come ashore here?”\\n\\n“They put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I’d ha’ been\\nglad to pison the beer myself,” said the Jack, “or put some rattling\\nphysic in it.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“_I_ know why,” said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much\\nmud had washed into his throat.\\n\\n“He thinks,” said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale\\neye, who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,—“he thinks they was, what\\nthey wasn’t.”\\n\\n“_I_ knows what I thinks,” observed the Jack.\\n\\n“_You_ thinks Custom ’Us, Jack?” said the landlord.\\n\\n“I do,” said the Jack.\\n\\n“Then you’re wrong, Jack.”\\n\\n“AM I!”\\n\\nIn the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in\\nhis views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into it,\\nknocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on\\nagain. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he\\ncould afford to do anything.\\n\\n“Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,\\nJack?” asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.\\n\\n“Done with their buttons?” returned the Jack. “Chucked ’em overboard.\\nSwallered ’em. Sowed ’em, to come up small salad. Done with their\\nbuttons!”\\n\\n“Don’t be cheeky, Jack,” remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and\\npathetic way.\\n\\n“A Custom ’Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons,” said the\\nJack, repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, “when\\nthey comes betwixt him and his own light. A four and two sitters don’t\\ngo hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and\\nboth with and against another, without there being Custom ’Us at the\\nbottom of it.” Saying which he went out in disdain; and the landlord,\\nhaving no one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the\\nsubject.\\n\\nThis dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind\\nwas muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and\\nI had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley\\nhovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an\\nugly circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced\\nProvis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startop\\nby this time knew the state of the case), and held another council.\\nWhether we should remain at the house until near the steamer’s time,\\nwhich would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off\\nearly in the morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we\\ndeemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an hour\\nor so of the steamer’s time, and then to get out in her track, and\\ndrift easily with the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into\\nthe house and went to bed.\\n\\nI lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a\\nfew hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house\\n(the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled\\nme. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the\\nwindow. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,\\nas my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw\\ntwo men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking at\\nnothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I\\ncould discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction\\nof the Nore.\\n\\nMy first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men going\\naway. But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the back\\nof the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder\\nday than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I\\ncould see the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I\\nsoon lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the\\nmatter, and fell asleep again.\\n\\nWe were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before\\nbreakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our\\ncharge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the\\nmen belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no\\nthought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,—as, indeed,\\nit might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away\\ntogether to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take\\nus aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about\\nnoon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he\\nand I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.\\n\\nHe smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me\\non the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in\\ndanger, not he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As\\nwe approached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place,\\nwhile I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had\\npassed in the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no\\nboat off the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were\\nthere any signs of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the\\ntide was high, and there might have been some footprints under water.\\n\\nWhen he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I\\nwaved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;\\nsometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving\\nabout to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got\\naboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that\\ntime it wanted but ten minutes of one o’clock, and we began to look out\\nfor her smoke.\\n\\nBut, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards\\nwe saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on\\nat full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity of\\nsaying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands\\ncordially, and neither Herbert’s eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I\\nsaw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way\\nahead of us, and row out into the same track.\\n\\nA stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer’s smoke,\\nby reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,\\ncoming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the\\ntide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to\\nsit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, “Trust to\\nme, dear boy,” and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was\\nvery skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and\\nfallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,\\nshe kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or\\ntwo when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and\\nlooked at us attentively,—as did all the rowers; the other sitter was\\nwrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some\\ninstruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in\\neither boat.\\n\\nStartop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,\\nand gave me the word “Hamburg,” in a low voice, as we sat face to face.\\nShe was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew\\nlouder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,\\nwhen the galley hailed us. I answered.\\n\\n“You have a returned Transport there,” said the man who held the lines.\\n“That’s the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,\\notherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,\\nand you to assist.”\\n\\nAt the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,\\nhe ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke\\nahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on\\nto our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great\\nconfusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and\\nheard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but\\nfelt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw\\nthe steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner’s shoulder,\\nand saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,\\nand saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite\\nfrantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,\\nlean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the\\nshrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that\\nthe face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.\\nStill, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white\\nterror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board\\nthe steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink\\nfrom under me.\\n\\nIt was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand\\nmill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was\\ntaken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there;\\nbut our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.\\n\\nWhat with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of\\nher steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first\\ndistinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the\\ngalley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong\\nstrokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and\\neagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,\\nbearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up\\nhis hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and\\ntrue before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,\\nbut not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled\\nat the wrists and ankles.\\n\\nThe galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water\\nwas resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not\\nunderstanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had\\nbeen hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and\\nwe were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out\\nwas kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were\\ngone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now.\\n\\nAt length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern\\nwe had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise.\\nHere I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,—Provis no\\nlonger,—who had received some very severe injury in the chest, and a\\ndeep cut in the head.\\n\\nHe told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the\\nsteamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to\\nhis chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought\\nhe had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did\\nnot pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson,\\nbut that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify\\nhim, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had\\nboth gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him\\n(Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep him\\nin it, had capsized us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down\\nfiercely locked in each other’s arms, and that there had been a\\nstruggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out,\\nand swum away.\\n\\nI never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told\\nme. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their\\ngoing overboard.\\n\\nWhen I asked this officer’s permission to change the prisoner’s wet\\nclothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the\\npublic-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take\\ncharge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book\\nwhich had once been in my hands passed into the officer’s. He further\\ngave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to\\naccord that grace to my two friends.\\n\\nThe Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone\\ndown, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was\\nlikeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to\\nbe much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it\\ntook about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may\\nhave been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in\\nvarious stages of decay.\\n\\nWe remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then\\nMagwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and\\nStartop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a\\ndoleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch’s side, I felt\\nthat that was my place henceforth while he lived.\\n\\nFor now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,\\nwounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man\\nwho had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,\\ngratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a\\nseries of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to\\nJoe.\\n\\nHis breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,\\nand often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the arm\\nI could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that I\\ncould not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was\\nunquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,\\npeople enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not\\ndoubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who had\\nbeen presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since broken\\nprison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation\\nunder a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who\\nwas the cause of his arrest.\\n\\nAs we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,\\nand as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him how\\ngrieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.\\n\\n“Dear boy,” he answered, “I’m quite content to take my chance. I’ve\\nseen my boy, and he can be a gentleman without me.”\\n\\nNo. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.\\nApart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick’s hint now.\\nI foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to\\nthe Crown.\\n\\n“Lookee here, dear boy,” said he “It’s best as a gentleman should not\\nbe knowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come by\\nchance alonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for\\nthe last o’ many times, and I don’t ask no more.”\\n\\n“I will never stir from your side,” said I, “when I am suffered to be\\nnear you. Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!”\\n\\nI felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away as\\nhe lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his\\nthroat,—softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thing\\nthat he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might\\nnot otherwise have thought of until too late,—that he need never know\\nhow his hopes of enriching me had perished.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter LV.\\n\\n\\nHe was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been\\nimmediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down\\nfor an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped,\\nto speak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had\\nmeant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened\\nthat there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could\\ngive the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his\\nprivate house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and\\nMr. Jaggers on the prisoner’s behalf would admit nothing. It was the\\nsole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five\\nminutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could\\nprevent its going against us.\\n\\nI imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the\\nfate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for\\nhaving “let it slip through my fingers,” and said we must memorialise\\nby and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal\\nfrom me that, although there might be many cases in which the\\nforfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this\\ncase to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not\\nrelated to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;\\nhe had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his\\napprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I\\nfinally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my\\nheart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to\\nestablish one.\\n\\nThere appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had\\nhoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some\\naccurate knowledge of Magwitch’s affairs. When his body was found, many\\nmiles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he\\nwas only recognisable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still\\nlegible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a\\nbanking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the\\ndesignation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of\\ninformation were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.\\nJaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His\\nignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but\\nthat my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers’s aid.\\n\\nAfter three days’ delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over\\nfor the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness\\ncame, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial\\nat the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.\\n\\nIt was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one\\nevening, a good deal cast down, and said,—\\n\\n“My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.”\\n\\nHis partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he\\nthought.\\n\\n“We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am\\nvery much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.”\\n\\n“Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but\\nmy need is no greater now than at another time.”\\n\\n“You will be so lonely.”\\n\\n“I have not leisure to think of that,” said I. “You know that I am\\nalways with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I\\nshould be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away from\\nhim, you know that my thoughts are with him.”\\n\\nThe dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling to\\nboth of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.\\n\\n“My dear fellow,” said Herbert, “let the near prospect of our\\nseparation—for, it is very near—be my justification for troubling you\\nabout yourself. Have you thought of your future?”\\n\\n“No, for I have been afraid to think of any future.”\\n\\n“But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must\\nnot be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few\\nfriendly words go, with me.”\\n\\n“I will,” said I.\\n\\n“In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a—”\\n\\nI saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, “A\\nclerk.”\\n\\n“A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as a\\nclerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now,\\nHandel,—in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?”\\n\\nThere was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in\\nwhich after saying “Now, Handel,” as if it were the grave beginning of\\na portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone,\\nstretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.\\n\\n“Clara and I have talked about it again and again,” Herbert pursued,\\n“and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in\\nher eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come\\ntogether, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her\\nhusband’s friend that he is her friend too. We should get on so well,\\nHandel!”\\n\\nI thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could\\nnot yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, my\\nmind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.\\nSecondly,—Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my\\nthoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.\\n\\n“But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury\\nto your business, leave the question open for a little while—”\\n\\n“For any while,” cried Herbert. “Six months, a year!”\\n\\n“Not so long as that,” said I. “Two or three months at most.”\\n\\nHerbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,\\nand said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must\\ngo away at the end of the week.\\n\\n“And Clara?” said I.\\n\\n“The dear little thing,” returned Herbert, “holds dutifully to her\\nfather as long as he lasts; but he won’t last long. Mrs. Whimple\\nconfides to me that he is certainly going.”\\n\\n“Not to say an unfeeling thing,” said I, “he cannot do better than go.”\\n\\n“I am afraid that must be admitted,” said Herbert; “and then I shall\\ncome back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I\\nwill walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed\\ndarling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the\\nred book, and hasn’t a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune for\\nthe son of my mother!”\\n\\nOn the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,—full of\\nbright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,—as he sat on one of the\\nseaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little note\\nto Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and\\nover again, and then went to my lonely home,—if it deserved the name;\\nfor it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.\\n\\nOn the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an\\nunsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had not seen him\\nalone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had\\ncome, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of\\nexplanation in reference to that failure.\\n\\n“The late Compeyson,” said Wemmick, “had by little and little got at\\nthe bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was\\nfrom the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people\\nbeing always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open,\\nseeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I\\nthought that would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only\\nsuppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man,\\nhabitually to deceive his own instruments. You don’t blame me, I hope,\\nMr. Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.”\\n\\n“I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most\\nearnestly for all your interest and friendship.”\\n\\n“Thank you, thank you very much. It’s a bad job,” said Wemmick,\\nscratching his head, “and I assure you I haven’t been so cut up for a\\nlong time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable\\nproperty. Dear me!”\\n\\n“What _I_ think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.”\\n\\n“Yes, to be sure,” said Wemmick. “Of course, there can be no objection\\nto your being sorry for him, and I’d put down a five-pound note myself\\nto get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson\\nhaving been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and\\nbeing so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have\\nbeen saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been\\nsaved. That’s the difference between the property and the owner, don’t\\nyou see?”\\n\\nI invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass of\\ngrog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he\\nwas drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up\\nto it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,—\\n\\n“What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?”\\n\\n“Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.”\\n\\n“These twelve years, more likely,” said Wemmick. “Yes. I’m going to\\ntake a holiday. More than that; I’m going to take a walk. More than\\nthat; I’m going to ask you to take a walk with me.”\\n\\nI was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,\\nwhen Wemmick anticipated me.\\n\\n“I know your engagements,” said he, “and I know you are out of sorts,\\nMr. Pip. But if you _could_ oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.\\nIt ain’t a long walk, and it’s an early one. Say it might occupy you\\n(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn’t you\\nstretch a point and manage it?”\\n\\nHe had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little\\nto do for him. I said I could manage it,—would manage it,—and he was so\\nvery much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his\\nparticular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half\\npast eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.\\n\\nPunctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday\\nmorning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking\\ntighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two\\nglasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have\\nbeen stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his\\nbedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.\\n\\nWhen we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and\\nwere going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was\\nconsiderably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it\\nover his shoulder. “Why, we are not going fishing!” said I. “No,”\\nreturned Wemmick, “but I like to walk with one.”\\n\\nI thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went\\ntowards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said\\nsuddenly,—\\n\\n“Halloa! Here’s a church!”\\n\\nThere was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather\\nsurprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,—\\n\\n“Let’s go in!”\\n\\nWe went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked\\nall round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets,\\nand getting something out of paper there.\\n\\n“Halloa!” said he. “Here’s a couple of pair of gloves! Let’s put ’em\\non!”\\n\\nAs the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened\\nto its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They\\nwere strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side\\ndoor, escorting a lady.\\n\\n“Halloa!” said Wemmick. “Here’s Miss Skiffins! Let’s have a wedding.”\\n\\nThat discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now\\nengaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The\\nAged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the\\naltar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much\\ndifficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to\\nput him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the\\npillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old\\ngentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe\\nresistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to\\nperfection.\\n\\nThe clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at\\nthose fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without\\npreparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out\\nof his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, “Halloa! Here’s a\\nring!”\\n\\nI acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;\\nwhile a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby’s, made a\\nfeint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of\\ngiving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the\\nclergyman’s being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.\\nWhen he said, “Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?” the\\nold gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we\\nhad arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.\\nUpon which, the clergyman said again, “WHO giveth this woman to be\\nmarried to this man?” The old gentleman being still in a state of most\\nestimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed\\nvoice, “Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?” To which the Aged replied\\nwith great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, “All right, John,\\nall right, my boy!” And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon\\nit, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely\\nmarried that day.\\n\\nIt was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church\\nWemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it,\\nand put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future,\\nput her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. “_Now_, Mr.\\nPip,” said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came\\nout, “let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a\\nwedding-party!”\\n\\nBreakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so\\naway upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle\\nboard in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after\\nthe solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer\\nunwound Wemmick’s arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in\\na high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case,\\nand submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have\\ndone.\\n\\nWe had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on\\ntable, Wemmick said, “Provided by contract, you know; don’t be afraid\\nof it!” I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the\\nCastle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I\\ncould.\\n\\nWemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with\\nhim, and wished him joy.\\n\\n“Thankee!” said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. “She’s such a manager of\\nfowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for\\nyourself. I say, Mr. Pip!” calling me back, and speaking low. “This is\\naltogether a Walworth sentiment, please.”\\n\\n“I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,” said I.\\n\\nWemmick nodded. “After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers may\\nas well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or\\nsomething of the kind.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter LVI.\\n\\n\\nHe lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his\\ncommittal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken\\ntwo ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great\\npain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his\\nhurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke\\nvery little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the\\nfirst duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he\\nought to hear.\\n\\nBeing far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after\\nthe first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities of\\nbeing with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for his\\nillness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a\\ndetermined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.\\n\\nAlthough I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the\\nregularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record\\non his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I\\ndo not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he\\nwasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day\\nwhen the prison door closed upon him.\\n\\nThe kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man\\nwho was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner\\nor from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered\\nover the question whether he might have been a better man under better\\ncircumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that\\nway, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.\\n\\nIt happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his\\ndesperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in\\nattendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his\\neyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had\\nseen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was\\na little child. As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I\\nnever knew him complain.\\n\\nWhen the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be\\nmade for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions. It\\nwas obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,\\nand was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the\\nbar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting\\nclose to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he\\nstretched forth to me.\\n\\nThe trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said\\nfor him were said,—how he had taken to industrious habits, and had\\nthriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that\\nhe had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It\\nwas impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him\\nguilty.\\n\\nAt that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible\\nexperience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing\\nof Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of\\nDeath. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds\\nbefore me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that\\nI saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that\\nsentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,\\nthat he might get breath enough to keep life in him.\\n\\nThe whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment,\\ndown to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering\\nin the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside\\nit at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and\\nwomen; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and\\nweeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There\\nhad been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been\\nstilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains\\nand nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great\\ngallery full of people,—a large theatrical audience,—looked on, as the\\ntwo-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge\\naddressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must\\nsingle out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had\\nbeen an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments\\nand punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of\\nyears; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had\\nmade his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable\\nman would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when\\nfar removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a\\npeaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those\\npropensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered\\nhim a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and\\nrepentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.\\nBeing here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading\\nthe officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of\\nflight, he had resisted them, and had—he best knew whether by express\\ndesign, or in the blindness of his hardihood—caused the death of his\\ndenouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment\\nfor his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his\\ncase being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.\\n\\nThe sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the\\nglittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of\\nlight between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,\\nand perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,\\nwith absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all\\nthings, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face\\nin this way of light, the prisoner said, “My Lord, I have received my\\nsentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,” and sat down\\nagain. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had\\nto say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of\\nthem were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard\\nlook of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three\\nshook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had\\ntaken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of\\nhaving to be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held\\nmy hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got\\nup (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere),\\nand pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him\\nand me.\\n\\nI earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder’s\\nReport was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that\\nnight to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting\\nforth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my\\nsake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I\\nhad finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men\\nin authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the\\nCrown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took\\nno rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed\\nin these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away\\nfrom the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopeful\\nand less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable\\nrestlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,\\nwandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions.\\nTo the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold,\\ndusty spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and\\ntheir long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.\\n\\nThe daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more\\nstrictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an\\nintention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I\\nsat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there,\\nthat I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the\\nsingleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There\\nwas duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer\\nalways gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick\\nprisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as\\nsick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be\\nthanked!) always joined in the same report.\\n\\nAs the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly\\nlooking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face\\nuntil some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would\\nsubside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then\\nhe would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to\\nunderstand his meaning very well.\\n\\nThe number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in\\nhim than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and\\nlighted up as I entered.\\n\\n“Dear boy,” he said, as I sat down by his bed: “I thought you was late.\\nBut I knowed you couldn’t be that.”\\n\\n“It is just the time,” said I. “I waited for it at the gate.”\\n\\n“You always waits at the gate; don’t you, dear boy?”\\n\\n“Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time.”\\n\\n“Thank’ee dear boy, thank’ee. God bless you! You’ve never deserted me,\\ndear boy.”\\n\\nI pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once\\nmeant to desert him.\\n\\n“And what’s the best of all,” he said, “you’ve been more comfortable\\nalonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.\\nThat’s best of all.”\\n\\nHe lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,\\nand love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and\\na film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.\\n\\n“Are you in much pain to-day?”\\n\\n“I don’t complain of none, dear boy.”\\n\\n“You never do complain.”\\n\\nHe had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to\\nmean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid\\nit there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.\\n\\nThe allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I\\nfound the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,\\n“You needn’t go yet.” I thanked him gratefully, and asked, “Might I\\nspeak to him, if he can hear me?”\\n\\nThe governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,\\nthough it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid\\nlook at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.\\n\\n“Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I\\nsay?”\\n\\nA gentle pressure on my hand.\\n\\n“You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.”\\n\\nA stronger pressure on my hand.\\n\\n“She lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a\\nlady and very beautiful. And I love her!”\\n\\nWith a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my\\nyielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,\\nhe gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying\\non it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away,\\nand his head dropped quietly on his breast.\\n\\nMindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men\\nwho went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better\\nwords that I could say beside his bed, than “O Lord, be merciful to him\\na sinner!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter LVII.\\n\\n\\nNow that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention to\\nquit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally\\ndetermine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them. At once I put bills\\nup in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and\\nbegan to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought\\nrather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and\\nconcentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth\\nbeyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me\\nhad enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that\\nit was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even\\ncareless as to that.\\n\\nFor a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,—anywhere,\\naccording as I happened to sink down,—with a heavy head and aching\\nlimbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which\\nappeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror;\\nand when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I\\nfound I could not do so.\\n\\nWhether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the\\nnight, groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether\\nI had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great\\nterror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found\\nmyself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up\\nthe stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been\\ninexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and\\ngroaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my\\nown making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark\\ncorner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again,\\nthat Miss Havisham was consuming within it,—these were things that I\\ntried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that\\nmorning on my bed. But the vapour of a limekiln would come between me\\nand them, disordering them all, and it was through the vapour at last\\nthat I saw two men looking at me.\\n\\n“What do you want?” I asked, starting; “I don’t know you.”\\n\\n“Well, sir,” returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the\\nshoulder, “this is a matter that you’ll soon arrange, I dare say, but\\nyou’re arrested.”\\n\\n“What is the debt?”\\n\\n“Hundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six. Jeweller’s account, I\\nthink.”\\n\\n“What is to be done?”\\n\\n“You had better come to my house,” said the man. “I keep a very nice\\nhouse.”\\n\\nI made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended to\\nthem, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I\\nstill lay there.\\n\\n“You see my state,” said I. “I would come with you if I could; but\\nindeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die\\nby the way.”\\n\\nPerhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to\\nbelieve that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in my\\nmemory by only this one slender thread, I don’t know what they did,\\nexcept that they forbore to remove me.\\n\\nThat I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that I\\noften lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I\\nconfounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a\\nbrick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the\\ngiddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a\\nvast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored\\nin my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered\\noff; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own\\nremembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimes\\nstruggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and\\nthat I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and\\nwould then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me\\ndown, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was a\\nconstant tendency in all these people,—who, when I was very ill, would\\npresent all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face,\\nand would be much dilated in size,—above all, I say, I knew that there\\nwas an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, to\\nsettle down into the likeness of Joe.\\n\\nAfter I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice\\nthat while all its other features changed, this one consistent feature\\ndid not change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. I\\nopened my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the\\nbedside, Joe. I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the\\nwindow-seat, smoking his pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw\\nJoe. I asked for cooling drink, and the dear hand that gave it me was\\nJoe’s. I sank back on my pillow after drinking, and the face that\\nlooked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.\\n\\nAt last, one day, I took courage, and said, “_Is_ it Joe?”\\n\\nAnd the dear old home-voice answered, “Which it air, old chap.”\\n\\n“O Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe. Strike me, Joe. Tell\\nme of my ingratitude. Don’t be so good to me!”\\n\\nFor Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side, and\\nput his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.\\n\\n“Which dear old Pip, old chap,” said Joe, “you and me was ever friends.\\nAnd when you’re well enough to go out for a ride—what larks!”\\n\\nAfter which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his back\\ntowards me, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented me\\nfrom getting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering,\\n“O God bless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!”\\n\\nJoe’s eyes were red when I next found him beside me; but I was holding\\nhis hand, and we both felt happy.\\n\\n“How long, dear Joe?”\\n\\n“Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old\\nchap?”\\n\\n“Yes, Joe.”\\n\\n“It’s the end of May, Pip. To-morrow is the first of June.”\\n\\n“And have you been here all that time, dear Joe?”\\n\\n“Pretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your\\nbeing ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post,\\nand being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal\\nof walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part,\\nand marriage were the great wish of his hart—”\\n\\n“It is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what you\\nsaid to Biddy.”\\n\\n“Which it were,” said Joe, “that how you might be amongst strangers,\\nand that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a\\nmoment might not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her word were, ‘Go\\nto him, without loss of time.’ That,” said Joe, summing up with his\\njudicial air, “were the word of Biddy. ‘Go to him,’ Biddy say, ‘without\\nloss of time.’ In short, I shouldn’t greatly deceive you,” Joe added,\\nafter a little grave reflection, “if I represented to you that the word\\nof that young woman were, ‘without a minute’s loss of time.’”\\n\\nThere Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked to\\nin great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at\\nstated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that\\nI was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay\\nquiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in\\nit.\\n\\nEvidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at\\nhim, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the\\npride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its\\ncurtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as\\nthe airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the\\nroom kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own\\nwriting-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,\\nJoe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the\\npen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his\\nsleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was\\nnecessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,\\nand to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin;\\nand when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might\\nhave been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen\\nspluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on\\nthe side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into\\nspace, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was\\ntripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he\\ngot on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had\\nremoved a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with\\nhis two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the\\neffect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,\\nwith unbounded satisfaction.\\n\\nNot to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to\\ntalk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. He\\nshook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.\\n\\n“Is she dead, Joe?”\\n\\n“Why you see, old chap,” said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by\\nway of getting at it by degrees, “I wouldn’t go so far as to say that,\\nfor that’s a deal to say; but she ain’t—”\\n\\n“Living, Joe?”\\n\\n“That’s nigher where it is,” said Joe; “she ain’t living.”\\n\\n“Did she linger long, Joe?”\\n\\n“Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if you\\nwas put to it) a week,” said Joe; still determined, on my account, to\\ncome at everything by degrees.\\n\\n“Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?”\\n\\n“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “it do appear that she had settled the most\\nof it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she had\\nwrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the\\naccident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,\\ndo you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand\\nunto him? ‘Because of Pip’s account of him, the said Matthew.’ I am\\ntold by Biddy, that air the writing,” said Joe, repeating the legal\\nturn as if it did him infinite good, “‘account of him the said\\nMatthew.’ And a cool four thousand, Pip!”\\n\\nI never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature\\nof the four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money\\nmore to him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being\\ncool.\\n\\nThis account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I\\nhad done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other\\nrelations had any legacies?\\n\\n“Miss Sarah,” said Joe, “she have twenty-five pound perannium fur to\\nbuy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twenty\\npound down. Mrs.—what’s the name of them wild beasts with humps, old\\nchap?”\\n\\n“Camels?” said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.\\n\\nJoe nodded. “Mrs. Camels,” by which I presently understood he meant\\nCamilla, “she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in\\nspirits when she wake up in the night.”\\n\\nThe accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give\\nme great confidence in Joe’s information. “And now,” said Joe, “you\\nain’t that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one\\nadditional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick he’s been a bustin’ open a\\ndwelling-ouse.”\\n\\n“Whose?” said I.\\n\\n“Not, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,” said\\nJoe, apologetically; “still, a Englishman’s ouse is his Castle, and\\ncastles must not be busted ’cept when done in war time. And wotsume’er\\nthe failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.”\\n\\n“Is it Pumblechook’s house that has been broken into, then?”\\n\\n“That’s it, Pip,” said Joe; “and they took his till, and they took his\\ncash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,\\nand they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him\\nup to his bedpust, and they giv’ him a dozen, and they stuffed his\\nmouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But he\\nknowed Orlick, and Orlick’s in the county jail.”\\n\\nBy these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow\\nto gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe\\nstayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.\\n\\nFor the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,\\nthat I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to me in\\nthe old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old\\nunassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my\\nlife since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles\\nof the fever that was gone. He did everything for me except the\\nhousehold work, for which he had engaged a very decent woman, after\\npaying off the laundress on his first arrival. “Which I do assure you,\\nPip,” he would often say, in explanation of that liberty; “I found her\\na tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and drawing off the\\nfeathers in a bucket, for sale. Which she would have tapped yourn next,\\nand draw’d it off with you a laying on it, and was then a carrying away\\nthe coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the\\nwine and spirits in your Wellington boots.”\\n\\nWe looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had\\nonce looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day\\ncame, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,\\ntook me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were\\nstill the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of\\nthe wealth of his great nature.\\n\\nAnd Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,\\nwhere the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,\\nand sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be\\nSunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought how\\nit had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been\\nforming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and\\nby night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning\\nand tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed\\nthere came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday\\nbells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I\\nfelt that I was not nearly thankful enough,—that I was too weak yet to\\nbe even that,—and I laid my head on Joe’s shoulder, as I had laid it\\nlong ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too\\nmuch for my young senses.\\n\\nMore composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used to\\ntalk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change\\nwhatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my\\neyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.\\n\\nWhen we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me—so\\neasily!—across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful\\nChristmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet\\nmade any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of\\nmy late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself\\nnow, and put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself\\nwhether I ought to refer to it when he did not.\\n\\n“Have you heard, Joe,” I asked him that evening, upon further\\nconsideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, “who my patron\\nwas?”\\n\\n“I heerd,” returned Joe, “as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.”\\n\\n“Did you hear who it was, Joe?”\\n\\n“Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv’ you\\nthe bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.”\\n\\n“So it was.”\\n\\n“Astonishing!” said Joe, in the placidest way.\\n\\n“Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?” I presently asked, with\\nincreasing diffidence.\\n\\n“Which? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I think,” said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather\\nevasively at the window-seat, “as I _did_ hear tell that how he were\\nsomething or another in a general way in that direction.”\\n\\n“Did you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?”\\n\\n“Not partickler, Pip.”\\n\\n“If you would like to hear, Joe—” I was beginning, when Joe got up and\\ncame to my sofa.\\n\\n“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe, bending over me. “Ever the best of\\nfriends; ain’t us, Pip?”\\n\\nI was ashamed to answer him.\\n\\n“Wery good, then,” said Joe, as if I _had_ answered; “that’s all right;\\nthat’s agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as\\nbetwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There’s subjects enough\\nas betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your\\npoor sister and her Rampages! And don’t you remember Tickler?”\\n\\n“I do indeed, Joe.”\\n\\n“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe. “I done what I could to keep you and\\nTickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my\\ninclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it\\nwere not so much,” said Joe, in his favourite argumentative way, “that\\nshe dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that\\nshe dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain’t a\\ngrab at a man’s whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your\\nsister was quite welcome), that ’ud put a man off from getting a little\\nchild out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into\\nheavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up\\nand says to himself, ‘Where is the good as you are a-doing? I grant you\\nI see the ’arm,’ says the man, ‘but I don’t see the good. I call upon\\nyou, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.’”\\n\\n“The man says?” I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.\\n\\n“The man says,” Joe assented. “Is he right, that man?”\\n\\n“Dear Joe, he is always right.”\\n\\n“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “then abide by your words. If he’s always\\nright (which in general he’s more likely wrong), he’s right when he\\nsays this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when\\nyou was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know’d as J.\\nGargery’s power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal\\nto his inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two\\nsech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy\\ngiv’ herself a deal o’ trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost\\nawful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this\\nlight, as I should so put it. Both of which,” said Joe, quite charmed\\nwith his logical arrangement, “being done, now this to you a true\\nfriend, say. Namely. You mustn’t go a overdoing on it, but you must\\nhave your supper and your wine and water, and you must be put betwixt\\nthe sheets.”\\n\\nThe delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact\\nand kindness with which Biddy—who with her woman’s wit had found me out\\nso soon—had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But\\nwhether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had all\\ndissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not\\nunderstand.\\n\\nAnother thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to\\ndevelop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension\\nof, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less\\neasy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear\\nfellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,\\nthe dear “old Pip, old chap,” that now were music in my ears. I too had\\nfallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,\\nimperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe’s hold upon them began\\nto slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to\\nunderstand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was\\nall mine.\\n\\nAh! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that\\nin prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given\\nJoe’s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got\\nstronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better\\nloosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?\\n\\nIt was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the\\nTemple Gardens leaning on Joe’s arm, that I saw this change in him very\\nplainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at\\nthe river, and I chanced to say as we got up,—\\n\\n“See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back\\nby myself.”\\n\\n“Which do not overdo it, Pip,” said Joe; “but I shall be happy fur to\\nsee you able, sir.”\\n\\nThe last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no\\nfurther than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weaker\\nthan I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was\\nthoughtful.\\n\\nI, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing\\nchange in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I\\nwas ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come\\ndown to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not\\nquite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little\\nsavings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I\\nmust not suffer him to do it.\\n\\nIt was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to\\nbed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,—to-morrow being\\nSunday,—and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday\\nmorning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this\\nlast vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts\\n(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go\\nout to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I\\ncleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically\\narrived at a resolution too.\\n\\nWe had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and\\nthen walked in the fields.\\n\\n“I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,” I said.\\n\\n“Dear old Pip, old chap, you’re a’most come round, sir.”\\n\\n“It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.”\\n\\n“Likeways for myself, sir,” Joe returned.\\n\\n“We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were\\ndays once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall\\nforget these.”\\n\\n“Pip,” said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, “there has\\nbeen larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us—have been.”\\n\\nAt night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done\\nall through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well\\nas in the morning?\\n\\n“Yes, dear Joe, quite.”\\n\\n“And are always a getting stronger, old chap?”\\n\\n“Yes, dear Joe, steadily.”\\n\\nJoe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and\\nsaid, in what I thought a husky voice, “Good night!”\\n\\nWhen I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of\\nmy resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before\\nbreakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;\\nfor, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and\\nhe was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.\\n\\nI hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These\\nwere its brief contents:—\\n\\n“Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear\\nPip and will do better without\\n\\n\\nJO.\\n\\n\\n“P.S. Ever the best of friends.”\\n\\n\\nEnclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I\\nhad been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my\\ncreditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be\\nquite recovered. I had never dreamed of Joe’s having paid the money;\\nbut Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in his name.\\n\\nWhat remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, and\\nthere to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrance\\nwith him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved\\nSecondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my\\nthoughts, and had formed into a settled purpose?\\n\\nThe purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her how\\nhumbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lost\\nall I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences in\\nmy first unhappy time. Then I would say to her, “Biddy, I think you\\nonce liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed\\naway from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been\\nsince. If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take\\nme with all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can\\nreceive me like a forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and\\nhave as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I am\\na little worthier of you that I was,—not much, but a little. And,\\nBiddy, it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forge\\nwith Joe, or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in\\nthis country, or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an\\nopportunity awaits me which I set aside, when it was offered, until I\\nknew your answer. And now, dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will\\ngo through the world with me, you will surely make it a better world\\nfor me, and me a better man for it, and I will try hard to make it a\\nbetter world for you.”\\n\\nSuch was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down to\\nthe old place to put it in execution. And how I sped in it is all I\\nhave left to tell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter LVIII.\\n\\n\\nThe tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to\\nmy native place and its neighbourhood before I got there. I found the\\nBlue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a\\ngreat change in the Boar’s demeanour. Whereas the Boar had cultivated\\nmy good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,\\nthe Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out\\nof property.\\n\\nIt was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so\\noften made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,\\nwhich was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), and\\ncould only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and\\npost-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as\\nin the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and\\nthe quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.\\n\\nEarly in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled\\nround by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits\\nof carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of\\nthe Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to\\nbe sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in\\nwhitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of\\nthe main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were\\nmarked off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn\\ndown to make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in\\nthe dust and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open\\ngate, and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger\\nwho had no business there, I saw the auctioneer’s clerk walking on the\\ncasks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler,\\npen in hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so\\noften pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.\\n\\nWhen I got back to my breakfast in the Boar’s coffee-room, I found Mr.\\nPumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not improved\\nin appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and\\naddressed me in the following terms:—\\n\\n“Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be\\nexpected! what else could be expected!”\\n\\nAs he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I\\nwas broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.\\n\\n“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, “put a muffin on table.\\nAnd has it come to this! Has it come to this!”\\n\\nI frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me\\nand poured out my tea—before I could touch the teapot—with the air of a\\nbenefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.\\n\\n“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, “put the salt on. In\\nhappier times,” addressing me, “I think you took sugar? And did you\\ntake milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said I, shortly, “but I don’t eat watercresses.”\\n\\n“You don’t eat ’em,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his\\nhead several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if\\nabstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. “True.\\nThe simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn’t bring any, William.”\\n\\nI went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand\\nover me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.\\n\\n“Little more than skin and bone!” mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. “And\\nyet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread\\nafore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!”\\n\\nThis reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner\\nin which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, “May I?”\\nand the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the\\nsame fat five fingers.\\n\\n“Hah!” he went on, handing me the bread and butter. “And air you\\na-going to Joseph?”\\n\\n“In heaven’s name,” said I, firing in spite of myself, “what does it\\nmatter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.”\\n\\nIt was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook\\nthe opportunity he wanted.\\n\\n“Yes, young man,” said he, releasing the handle of the article in\\nquestion, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the\\nbehoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, “I _will_ leave that\\nteapot alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I\\nforgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to\\nwish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of\\nprodigygality, to be stimilated by the ’olesome nourishment of your\\nforefathers. And yet,” said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and\\nwaiter, and pointing me out at arm’s length, “this is him as I ever\\nsported with in his days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I\\ntell you this is him!”\\n\\nA low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be\\nparticularly affected.\\n\\n“This is him,” said Pumblechook, “as I have rode in my shay-cart. This\\nis him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister\\nof which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M’ria from\\nher own mother, let him deny it if he can!”\\n\\nThe waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave\\nthe case a black look.\\n\\n“Young man,” said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old\\nfashion, “you air a-going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you ask\\nme, where you air a-going? I say to you, Sir, you air a-going to\\nJoseph.”\\n\\nThe waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.\\n\\n“Now,” said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of\\nsaying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and\\nconclusive, “I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of\\nthe Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is\\nWilliam, which his father’s name was Potkins if I do not deceive\\nmyself.”\\n\\n“You do not, sir,” said William.\\n\\n“In their presence,” pursued Pumblechook, “I will tell you, young man,\\nwhat to say to Joseph. Says you, “Joseph, I have this day seen my\\nearliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun’s. I will name no\\nnames, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have\\nseen that man.”\\n\\n“I swear I don’t see him here,” said I.\\n\\n“Say that likewise,” retorted Pumblechook. “Say you said that, and even\\nJoseph will probably betray surprise.”\\n\\n“There you quite mistake him,” said I. “I know better.”\\n\\n“Says you,” Pumblechook went on, “‘Joseph, I have seen that man, and\\nthat man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your\\ncharacter, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and\\nignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of\\ngratitoode. Yes, Joseph,’ says you,” here Pumblechook shook his head\\nand hand at me, “‘he knows my total deficiency of common human\\ngratitoode. _He_ knows it, Joseph, as none can. _You_ do not know it,\\nJoseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.’”\\n\\nWindy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face\\nto talk thus to mine.\\n\\n“Says you, ‘Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now\\nrepeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of\\nProvidence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it\\nplain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. _Reward of ingratitoode to\\nhis earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun’s_. But that man said he\\ndid not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to\\ndo it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would\\ndo it again.’”\\n\\n“It’s pity,” said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted\\nbreakfast, “that the man did not say what he had done and would do\\nagain.”\\n\\n“Squires of the Boar!” Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord,\\n“and William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town\\nor down town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do\\nit, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.”\\n\\nWith those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,\\nand left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by\\nthe virtues of that same indefinite “it.” I was not long after him in\\nleaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw him\\nholding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at his shop door to a\\nselect group, who honoured me with very unfavourable glances as I\\npassed on the opposite side of the way.\\n\\nBut, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose\\ngreat forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,\\ncontrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for\\nmy limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew\\nnearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness\\nfurther and further behind.\\n\\nThe June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were\\nsoaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more\\nbeautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many\\npleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the\\nchange for the better that would come over my character when I had a\\nguiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I\\nhad proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for\\nmy heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to pass,\\nthat I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel,\\nand whose wanderings had lasted many years.\\n\\nThe schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the\\nlittle roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness’\\nsake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a\\nholiday; no children were there, and Biddy’s house was closed. Some\\nhopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties,\\nbefore she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.\\n\\nBut the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it\\nunder the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe’s hammer.\\nLong after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I\\nheard it and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there,\\nand the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and\\ntheir leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the\\nclink of Joe’s hammer was not in the midsummer wind.\\n\\nAlmost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I\\nsaw it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no\\nglittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and\\nstill.\\n\\nBut the house was not deserted, and the best parlour seemed to be in\\nuse, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the\\nwindow was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning\\nto peep over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in\\narm.\\n\\nAt first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, but\\nin another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and she\\nwept to see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she,\\nbecause I looked so worn and white.\\n\\n“But dear Biddy, how smart you are!”\\n\\n“Yes, dear Pip.”\\n\\n“And Joe, how smart _you_ are!”\\n\\n“Yes, dear old Pip, old chap.”\\n\\nI looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then—\\n\\n“It’s my wedding-day!” cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, “and I am\\nmarried to Joe!”\\n\\nThey had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on the\\nold deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe’s\\nrestoring touch was on my shoulder. “Which he warn’t strong enough, my\\ndear, fur to be surprised,” said Joe. And Biddy said, “I ought to have\\nthought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.” They were both so\\noverjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to\\nthem, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their\\nday complete!\\n\\nMy first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never\\nbreathed this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with me\\nin my illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been\\nhis knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!\\n\\n“Dear Biddy,” said I, “you have the best husband in the whole world,\\nand if you could have seen him by my bed you would have—But no, you\\ncouldn’t love him better than you do.”\\n\\n“No, I couldn’t indeed,” said Biddy.\\n\\n“And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will\\nmake you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble\\nJoe!”\\n\\nJoe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before\\nhis eyes.\\n\\n“And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in\\ncharity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you\\nhave done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I\\nam going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I\\nshall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have\\nkept me out of prison, and have sent it to you, don’t think, dear Joe\\nand Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I\\ncould cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if\\nI could!”\\n\\nThey were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no\\nmore.\\n\\n“But I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,\\nand that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter\\nnight, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for\\never. Don’t tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don’t tell him, Biddy,\\nthat I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honoured you\\nboth, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child,\\nI said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I\\ndid.”\\n\\n“I ain’t a-going,” said Joe, from behind his sleeve, “to tell him\\nnothink o’ that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain’t. Nor yet no one ain’t.”\\n\\n“And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind\\nhearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you\\nsay the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and\\nthen I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better\\nof me, in the time to come!”\\n\\n“O dear old Pip, old chap,” said Joe. “God knows as I forgive you, if I\\nhave anythink to forgive!”\\n\\n“Amen! And God knows I do!” echoed Biddy.\\n\\n“Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few\\nminutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go\\nwith me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say\\ngood-bye!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition\\nwith my creditors,—who gave me ample time to pay them in full,—and I\\nwent out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England, and\\nwithin two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four\\nmonths I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across\\nthe parlour ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under\\nold Bill Barley’s growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to\\nmarry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until\\nhe brought her back.\\n\\nMany a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived\\nhappily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my\\ndebts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe. It\\nwas not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to\\nHerbert; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert’s partnership\\nhad been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it. So he\\ntold it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow\\nand I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must not\\nleave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we\\nmade mints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we had\\na good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so\\nmuch to Herbert’s ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often\\nwondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I\\nwas one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude\\nhad never been in him at all, but had been in me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter LIX.\\n\\n\\nFor eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily\\neyes,—though they had both been often before my fancy in the\\nEast,—when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, I\\nlaid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched it\\nso softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smoking\\nhis pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as\\nstrong as ever, though a little grey, sat Joe; and there, fenced into\\nthe corner with Joe’s leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking\\nat the fire, was—I again!\\n\\n“We giv’ him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,” said Joe,\\ndelighted, when I took another stool by the child’s side (but I did\\n_not_ rumple his hair), “and we hoped he might grow a little bit like\\nyou, and we think he do.”\\n\\nI thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and we\\ntalked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took\\nhim down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there,\\nand he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the\\nmemory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife\\nof the Above.\\n\\n“Biddy,” said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little\\ngirl lay sleeping in her lap, “you must give Pip to me one of these\\ndays; or lend him, at all events.”\\n\\n“No, no,” said Biddy, gently. “You must marry.”\\n\\n“So Herbert and Clara say, but I don’t think I shall, Biddy. I have so\\nsettled down in their home, that it’s not at all likely. I am already\\nquite an old bachelor.”\\n\\nBiddy looked down at her child, and put its little hand to her lips,\\nand then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into\\nmine. There was something in the action, and in the light pressure of\\nBiddy’s wedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.\\n\\n“Dear Pip,” said Biddy, “you are sure you don’t fret for her?”\\n\\n“O no,—I think not, Biddy.”\\n\\n“Tell me as an old, old friend. Have you quite forgotten her?\\n\\n“My dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a\\nforemost place there, and little that ever had any place there. But\\nthat poor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,—all\\ngone by!”\\n\\nNevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretly\\nintended to revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for\\nher sake. Yes, even so. For Estella’s sake.\\n\\nI had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life, and as being\\nseparated from her husband, who had used her with great cruelty, and\\nwho had become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice,\\nbrutality, and meanness. And I had heard of the death of her husband,\\nfrom an accident consequent on his ill-treatment of a horse. This\\nrelease had befallen her some two years before; for anything I knew,\\nshe was married again.\\n\\nThe early dinner hour at Joe’s, left me abundance of time, without\\nhurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.\\nBut, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think\\nof old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.\\n\\nThere was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the\\nwall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a\\nrough fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had\\nstruck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A\\ngate in the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.\\n\\nA cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet\\nup to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the\\nmoon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where\\nevery part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,\\nand where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was\\nlooking along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure\\nin it.\\n\\nThe figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving\\ntowards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the\\nfigure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away,\\nwhen it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if\\nmuch surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,—\\n\\n“Estella!”\\n\\n“I am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.”\\n\\nThe freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable\\nmajesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,\\nI had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,\\nsoftened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was\\nthe friendly touch of the once insensible hand.\\n\\nWe sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, “After so many years,\\nit is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our\\nfirst meeting was! Do you often come back?”\\n\\n“I have never been here since.”\\n\\n“Nor I.”\\n\\nThe moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white\\nceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought\\nof the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had\\nheard on earth.\\n\\nEstella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.\\n\\n“I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been\\nprevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!”\\n\\nThe silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and\\nthe same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowing\\nthat I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she\\nsaid quietly,—\\n\\n“Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in\\nthis condition?”\\n\\n“Yes, Estella.”\\n\\n“The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not\\nrelinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I\\nhave kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I\\nmade in all the wretched years.”\\n\\n“Is it to be built on?”\\n\\n“At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And\\nyou,” she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,—“you\\nlive abroad still?”\\n\\n“Still.”\\n\\n“And do well, I am sure?”\\n\\n“I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore—yes, I do\\nwell.”\\n\\n“I have often thought of you,” said Estella.\\n\\n“Have you?”\\n\\n“Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from\\nme the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant\\nof its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the\\nadmission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.”\\n\\n“You have always held your place in my heart,” I answered.\\n\\nAnd we were silent again until she spoke.\\n\\n“I little thought,” said Estella, “that I should take leave of you in\\ntaking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.”\\n\\n“Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,\\nthe remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and\\npainful.”\\n\\n“But you said to me,” returned Estella, very earnestly, “‘God bless\\nyou, God forgive you!’ And if you could say that to me then, you will\\nnot hesitate to say that to me now,—now, when suffering has been\\nstronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what\\nyour heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but—I hope—into a\\nbetter shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me\\nwe are friends.”\\n\\n“We are friends,” said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from\\nthe bench.\\n\\n“And will continue friends apart,” said Estella.\\n\\nI took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as\\nthe morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so\\nthe evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of\\ntranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting\\nfrom her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GREAT EXPECTATIONS ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 1400-0.txt or 1400-0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/0/1400/\\n\\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer, and David Widger\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n'"

제발 제 목을 자르진 말아주세요. 나리.” 나는 두려움에 떨며 간청했다. “제발 그러지 마세요.  나리.”\\n“네 이름이 뭐냐?”라고 그 사나이가 물었다. “어서 말해!” “핍이에요.”\\n“더 크게 말해” 그 사나이가 말했다. “더 크게!” “핍.  핍이에요. 핍이라고요.”\\n“어디서 살지?” 그 사나이가 말했다. “손으로 가리켜봐!”\\n\\u3000나는 손으로 우리 마을 쪽 방향을 가리켰다. 우리 마을은, 오리나무들과 가지만 남기고 가지를 모두 전지한(자른) 나무들 사이로 보이는 해안가 평지 위에 있었다. 그쪽 방향을 가리켰다. 마을은 여기(교회)에서 1.6km(걸어서 30분 거리)이상 떨어져 있었다.\\n\\u3000그 사나이는 나를 잠시 뚫어지게 바라본 후 나를 거꾸로 맸다.(거꾸로 세웠다) 그리고 내 호주머니를 뒤지기 시작했다.\\n호주머니에는  빵  한  조각밖에  없었다.  교회에  올  때면  호주머니에 넣어가지고 다니던 빵 한 조각뿐.\\n\\u3000교회 위아래가 다시 제대로 보였다. 그 사나이가 나를 갑자기  그리고 너무 세게 바로 세워는 바람에 내 발 아래에 교회 첨탑(뾰족탑)이 보일 정도였다.\\n\\u3000교회가 다시 위아래 제대로 보이게 되었을 때, 아이고! 나는 엄청 높은 묘비 위에 앉혀졌고, 그 사나이가 빵을 게걸스럽게 먹는 동안 두려 움에 몸을 마구  떨어야했다.\\n\\u3000“이 어린 개자식” 그 사나이가 자기 입술을 핥으며 말했다. “어라, 이 녀석 통통한 볼 따귀를 가졌군.”\\n\\u3000내 양 볼은 통통한 편이었다. 나도 그렇게 생각하고 있었다. 그렇지만 그때 나는 내 나이 또래들보다 몸집이 작았고 또 몸도 허약한 편이었다.\\n\\u3000“망할 것 당장 잡아먹고 싶군.” 그 사나이가 머리를 위협적으로 흔들면서 말했다. “내가 못 잡아먹을 줄 아느냐!”\\n\\u3000나는 정말이지 간절히 빌었다. 제발 저를 잡아먹지 말아달라고. 나는 그가 나를 얹어놓은 묘비를 더 세게 붙잡았다. 어느 정도는 묘비에서 떨어지지 않기 위해서, 어느 정도는 울음이 터져 나오려는 것을 억누르기 위해서다.\\n“자 여기 좀 봐라!” 그가 말했다. “네 엄마는 어디에 있지?” “저기에요. 저기에 있어요.” 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000그는 황급히 한 걸음 내달렸다가 멈추고는 자기 어깨너머로 주변을 둘러보았다.\\n\\u3000“저기요. 저기에요!” 내가 겁을 집어먹고 설명하기 시작했다. “조지아나 역시 여기에 잠들다. 저게 우리 엄마예요.”\\n\\u3000“이런!” 그가 되돌아오며 말했다. “엄마 옆에 누워있는 사람은 네 아 빠냐?”\\n\\u3000“예, 어르신” 내가 말했다. “이 지역 교회의 고인이 되신 피립 역시 여기에 잠들다.”\\n\\u3000“핫!” 그가 불명확한 소리로 중얼거렸다. 그리곤 뭔가 생각하는 듯 했다. “그럼 넌 누구하고 사느냐? 만약 내가 친절하게도 너를 살려둔다면 말이다. 물론 나는 아직 너를 살려둘지 말지를 결정 못했다. 누구 하고 살지?”\\n\\u3000“저희 누나랑 살아요, 나리. 조 가저리 부인요. 대장장이 조 가저리의  부인요. 어르신.”\\n“뭐 대장장이라고?”라고 말한 후 그는 자기 다리를 내려다보았다. \\n\\u3000멍한 표정으로 자신의 다리와 나를 번갈아 가며 쳐다보던 그가 내가 앉아 있는 묘비 쪽으로 다가와 두 팔로 나를 붙잡고는 뒤로 확 밀치는 것이다.\\n\\u3000그 결과 그는 아주 위압적인 눈빛으로 내 눈을 내려다볼 수 있었고, 그 바람에 나는 정말이지 어쩔 줄을 몰라 무기력한 눈빛으로 그의 눈을 올려다보아야했다.\\n\\u3000“자 내 눈을 봐라” 그가 말했다. “네가 네 목숨을 살릴지 말지가 달린 물음이다. 줄(무엇을 매끈하게 다듬는 데 쓰이는 줄)이 뭔지 알지?”\\n“예, 어르신.”\\n“좋아 그럼 빵이 뭔지도 알겠구나?” \\n“예, 알아요.”\\n\\u3000질문 하나하나마다 그는 나를 조금씩 더 뒤로 밀었고, 아마도 내가 의지할 데 없는 위험에 빠져있다는 인상을 강하게 주려는 듯 보였다.\\n\\u3000“줄을 갖다다오.” 그가 나를 밀며 말했다. “빵도 가져오고.” 그가 다시 밀며 말했다. “아니다. 둘 다 가져와.” 그가 또 다시  나를 밀며 말 했다. “만약 약속을 어길 경우, 네 놈의 심장과 간을 꺼내 먹어치우겠다.” 그가 다시 나를 밀며 말했다.\\n\\u3000나는 겁을 먹고 끔찍하게 떨고 있었고 그 바람에 현기증이 나서 결국 두  손으로  그를  끌어안아야했다. 내가  말했다. “부탁이에요. 제발  저 좀 바로 세워주세요. 토할 것 같단 말이에요. 그  바람에 아저씨가  지금 무슨 말씀을 하시는지 정신 차리고 들을 수가 없어요.”\\n\\u3000그 사나이는 나를 재빨리 내렸다 올리면서 한 바퀴 돌렸다. 그건 가장 무시무시한 경험이었다. 교회가 교회풍향계를 뛰어넘는 것을 보았을 정도였다.\\n\\u3000그리고서 그는 양팔로 나를 붙잡아 무덤 꼭대기에 바로 세우고는 다 음과 같은 무시무시한 얘기들을  널어놓았다.\\n\\u3000“좋아 내일 아침 일찍 줄(쇠를 자르는 연장)과 빵을 가져와라. 많이 가져와!  저쪽 옛날 포대(포병부대가 떠난 후 남은 시설물)에서 기다리고 있으마. 알겠지? 그리고 나 같은 사람을 만났다는 얘기를 아무에게도 절대로 말해서도 안 돼. 그런 낌새도 보여선 안 돼. 만약 네가 살고 싶다면 말 이야. 만약 내가 말한 걸 가져오지 않거나 내 얘기를 조금이라도 내뱉으면, 그게 아무리 작은 얘기라도, 네 심장과 간을 잡아 뜯어내 불에 구워 먹어치우겠다. 나는 지금 네가 생각하는 것처럼 혼자가 아냐. 알지? 저쪽에 젊은 놈이 한 명 더 숨어 있어. 그 녀석과 비교하면 난 천사야. 내가 방금 말한 걸 그 놈도 다 들었어. 그 젊은 놈은 냉혹하고 아주 특별한 방식으로 사내아이에게 접근하지. 그리곤 심장과 간을 꺼내는 거야. 그 놈에게서 몸을 숨기는 건 불 가능해. 사내아이가 자기 방문을 잠그고 따뜻한 침대 속에 쑤시고 들어가 있 어도, 사내아이가 아무리 옷을 머리까지 뒤집어쓰고 있어도, 아무리 사 내아이가 포근하고 안전하다고 느끼는 장소에서도 그 젊은 놈은 살금 살금 네발로 기어들어가 사내아이의 심장과 간을 잡아 당겨 찢어 내어 버리고 말지. 지금 이순간도 저 젊은 놈이 너를 해치려는 걸 내가 막고 있는 거야. 아주 힘든 일이지. 저 젊은 놈이 너에게 달려들어 심장과 간을 끄 집어내려는 것을 시작하지 못하게 하는 것이 얼마나 어려운지 알겠지? 자 어때? 아찔하지?”\\n\\u3000나는 내가 줄을 가져다드리겠노라고, 내가 할 수 있는 데까지  집에  남아 있는 음식조각들은 모두 챙겨서 가져다드리겠노라고 말했다. 그리고 무슨 일이 있어도 내일아침 일찍 포대(포병부대가 버린 시설물)로 아저씨를 찾아가겠다고  말했다.\\n\\u3000“약속해라. 만약 네가 약속을 지키지 않으면 하느님이 널 벌해도 좋다고 말이다.”라고 그 사나이가  말했고,\\n나는 그렇게 했다. 그러자 그가 나를 땅 위에 내려주었다.\\n\\u3000“자,” 그가 계속얘기를 이어갔다. “뭘 가져와야 하는지를 잘 기억해 뒀지! 줄이랑 빵이다. 내가 방금 말한 저쪽에 있는 저 젊은 놈도 잘 기 억해두고. 자 어서 네 집으로 가 보거라!”\\n“아~안녕히 계세요, 어르신.” 내가 비틀거리며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“젠장, 안녕이 넘친다!” 그가 자기 주변을 힐끔 돌아다보며 말했다. 춥고 축축한 평지가 펼쳐지고 있었다. “젠장, 차라리 개구리나 뱀장어 라면 더  좋을 텐데!”\\n\\u3000그와 동시에, 그는 양 팔로 자신의 떨고 있는 몸뚱이를 감싸 안았다.   그 자세는 마치 양 팔과 몸뚱이를 하나로 합치려는 듯 보였다. 꽉 감   싸고 있었다. 그리곤 그가 교회의 낮은 벽 쪽으로 다리를 절면서 느릿 느릿 나아갔다.\\n\\u3000나는 그가 걸어가는 것을 지켜보고 있었다. 그가 쐐기풀사이를 헤치고 나무딸기들 사이를 헤치며 자기 길을 찾아내 안전히 통과하고 있었다. 초록색 무덤 주위에는 나무딸기들로 가득했다. 내 어린 두  눈에 “그는 마치 무덤 속에서 살며시 손을 뻗치곤 발목이 잡힌 사람들을 무덤 속으로 연행해가려는 죽은 사람들의 손을 잘 피하고 있는 사람 같이 보였다.”\\n\\u3000그가 교회의 낮은 벽에 도착했다. 그가 벽을 뛰어넘었다. 그의 두 다 리는 마치 추위로 마비되어 뻣뻣해진 것 같아 보였다. 그때 그가 나를 찾으려는 듯 몸을  돌렸다.\\n\\u3000나는 그가 몸을 돌리는 것을 보자마자 내 얼굴을 집 방향 쪽으로 돌리고는 정말이지 있는 힘껏 내달리기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이내(곧) 어깨너머로 그를 되돌아보았는데, 그는  여전히 두 팔로 자기 몸뚱이를 감싸 앉은 채 강 쪽 방향으로 걸어가고 있었다. 여기 저기 늪지대 속에 빠져있던 큰 돌들 사이를 자신의 불편한 두 발로 헤치며 자기 길을 찾아내 안전히 통과하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 멈추고 그의 뒷모습을 찾았을  때에는, 늪지대는 이제 그저 한  줄기 검은 수평선으로만 보일 뿐이었다. 그리고 강은 늪지대보다 폭은 넓진 않지만 그래도 아직은 덜 검게 보이고 있었다. 어쨌든 강도 이젠 그저 또 하나의 한 줄기 검은 수평선으로만 보였다. 그리고 하늘은 이제 그저 일렬로 널어선 “기다랗고 성난 붉은 선들”과 “짙고 검은 선들”의  조합으로만 보였다.\\n\\u3000나는 어렴풋하게나마 강의 가장자리에서 두 개의 검은 물체를 식별 할 수 있었는데 그건 그 근처에서 유일하게 바로 서 있는 물체같이 보였다.\\n\\u3000둘 중 하나는, 선원들이 배의 키를 잡을 때 이용하던 등대였다. 그것은 마치 긴 막대기 위에 올린 후 고리를 제거한 통, 술을 담아 두는  나무로 된 통 같이 보였다. 여러분이 만약 등대 가까이에 다가간다면 그 추한 모습에 놀랄  것이다.\\n\\u3000다른 하나는, 한때 해적 한 명이 매달려 있었던 쇠사슬이 여러 개 달린 교수대였다.\\n\\u3000그는 교수대 쪽으로 다리를 절며 나아가고 있었다.  마치 해적이 다시 되살아나 줄에서 떨어졌다가 자신을 다시 매달기 위해 되돌아가는 모습처럼 보였다.\\n\\u3000그런 생각이 들자 정말이지 끔찍했다. 그리고 내가 “소들이 고개를 들고 그의 뒷모습을 쫓아 뚫어지게 쳐다보고 있는 모습”을 보았을 때, 나는 소들도 나와 똑같은 생각(교수대)을 하는지 매우 궁금해졌다.\\n\\u3000나는 그가 말한 ‘무시무시한 젊은 사람’이 어디에 숨어있는지 사방팔방 살펴보았지만 그런 모습은 어디에도 보이지 않았다. 하지만 나는 또다시 섬뜩한 겁이 났고 이번엔 정말이지 단 한 번도 멈추지 않은 채 집까지 내달렸다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 2장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000내 누나인 ‘조 가저리 부인’은 나보다 스무 살이 많았다. 누나는 이 웃들로부터 평판이 아주 좋았다. 왜냐하면 어린 나를 직접 자기 손으로 키웠기 때문이다. 누나도 이것에 대한 자부심이 대단했다.\\n\\u3000그때쯤에는 나도 “손수 키웠다”라는 표현의 의미를 내 스스로 알아챘을 때였다. 그리고 그녀가 얼마나 야무지고 거친 손을 가지고 있는지도 알고 있었다. 그 야무지고 거친 손바닥을 내 얼굴은 물론 매형의 얼굴에까지 갖다 바르기 일쑤였기 때문에(마구 때리는 버릇이 심해서) 그래서 나는 (누나에게 하도 손으로 많이 맞고 자라다 보니) 매형과 내(주인공)가 모두 ‘손’수 길러진 것은 아닌지 의심해보곤 했었다.\\n\\u3000그녀, 그러니까 내 누나는 아름다운 여자는 아니었다. 그래서 “조 가 저리(주인공의 매형)가 그녀와 결혼하게 그녀가 ‘손’수 일을 꾸미지 않 았을까?”하는 일반적인 인상을 받곤  했다.\\n\\u3000조(매형)는 꽤 괜찮은 사람이었다. 옆은 갈색의 곱슬곱슬한 머리카락을 그의 부드러운 얼굴 양 옆으로 떨어뜨리고 있는 사나이였다. 조의 눈은 이도저도 아닌 파란색이었는데 흰자위와 색이 좀 섞이지 않았을까 싶었다.\\n\\u3000그는 온화하며 천성이 선하고 마음씨가 고운 약간은 바보 같은 느낌이 나는  성격이 느긋한  내 친애하는  친구였다. 있잖은가? 헤라클레스의 힘과 헤라클레스의 약점(아킬레스건, 조가 약간 바보스러운 것)을 동시에 가진 그런 사람, 조가 그랬다.\\n\\u3000내 누나, 조 부인은 검은 머리카락에 검은 눈을 가진 여자로, 붉은 기운이 도는 피부를 가지고 있었는데, 그 때문에 나는 그녀가 목욕할 때 혹시 비누대신 넛맥그레이터(넛맥 껍질을 갈 때 사용하는 주방도구. ‘넛맥’은 ‘육두구’를 말함. ‘육두구’는 달콤하고 시원한 향이 나는 소스, TV드라마 대장금에서 장금이가 먹고 몸에 마비가 온 음식이 바로 ‘육두구’라고 함)를 사용하는 것은 아닌지 의심을 품곤 했다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 키가 크고 뼈가 다 드러날 정도로 앙상한 체격이었다. 두 고리를 뒤로 묶어 몸에 단단히 고정한 변변찮은 앞치마를 거의 언제나 두르고 있었다. 앞치마 앞에는 턱받이 같은 느낌으로 가슴부근에 장식을 달고 있었는데, 그 정사각형 장식에는 온갖 핀들과 바늘들이 가득 꽂혀있어 난공불락의 인상을 풍기곤 했다.\\n\\u3000누나는 “이 앞치마를 그렇게도 많이 입었다”라는 사실을 자신의 강력한 미덕이자 남편에 대한 강한 비난의 도구로 삼았다.\\n\\u3000그렇지만 나(주인공)는 ‘도대체 누나가 왜 그  앞치마를 입어야하는지?’ 그 이유를 전혀 알 수가 없었다. 혹은 ‘만약 누나가 그 앞치마를 입어야한다면 왜 누나가 그것을 벗어서는 안 되었는지?’ 나로선 그 이 유를 전혀 알 수 없었다. 그것도 하루 이틀도 아니고 누나의 생애를  통해  매일을 말이다.\\n\\u3000조의 대장간은 우리 집과 인접해있었다.(집 이웃집이 대장간이다) 우리 시골에 있는 대다수 집들이 목조건물이었다. 조의 대장간도 목조건물이었다.\\n\\u3000내가 ‘교회 부속의 묘지’에서 집까지 뛰어갔을 때, 대장간 문은 잠겨 있었다. 조(매형)는 부엌에 앉아 있었다. 조와 나는  일종의 동병상련 (서로 가엾게 여기고 동정하고 도움)을 공유하고 있었다. 우리 사이에 는 그와 같은 성격의 신뢰가 있었다. 내가 문의 빗장을 들어 올리고  맞은 편 벽난로의 구석에 앉아 있는 그를 엿보았을 때였다.  조는 이번 에도 나에게 신뢰할 수 있는 정보를 귀띔해주었다.\\n\\u3000“조 부인이 너를 찾으러 열두 번이나 외출했다 왔어, 핍. 그녀는 지금도 외출중이란다. 그러니까 이번 외출이 ‘빵 만드는 사람의 열둘’이야.” (‘빵 만드는 사람의 12’는 ‘13’을 말함)\\n“누나가요?”\\n\\u3000“그래, 핍” 조가 말했다. “그리고 더 나쁜 소식도 있단다, 핍. 누나가 간질이(회초리)까지 데리고  나갔단다.”\\n\\u3000이 음침한 정보(누나가 회초리를 가지고 주인공을 찾으러 나갔다)에 나는 내 조끼에 하나 남아 있던 단추를 빙글빙글 돌리며 아주 침울한 표정으로  불을 바라보았다.\\n\\u3000간질이는 회초리 끝에 왁스처리가 되어 있는 회초리로 내가 하도 맞아서 그 끝부분이 매끈해져  있었다.\\n\\u3000“누난 앉아 있었단다.” 조(주인공의 매형)가 말했다. “그러다가 벌떡 일어났지, 그리곤 회초리를 움켜쥐고선 흥분해서 날뛰더니  나갔단다. 그게 다야.” 조가 부지깽이로 아래쪽 벽난로 사이에 난 불을 끄면서 느릿느릿 말했다. “누난 흥분해서 날뛰더니 나갔단다, 핍.”\\n\\u3000“누나 나간 지 오래됐어, 조?” 나는 항상 조를 내 나이 또래 밖에 안 된 덩치 큰 아이로 취급했다.\\n\\u3000“글쎄.” 조가 ‘네덜란드 시계’(외국영화에서 자주 보이는 벽시계)를 힐끔 보며 말했다. “누나가 흥분해서 날뛰더니 나간 게, 가만 보자 마지막 철자가…, 한 5분쯤 됐어, 핍. 누나가 오는구나! 여보게, 자네 어서 문 뒤로 숨게, 회전식 타월 사이로 들어가 있어.”\\n\\u3000나는 조의 충고를 받아들였다. 내 누나, 조 부인이 문을 활짝 열어젖혔다. 문 뒤에 장애물이 있음을 감지한 누나는, 즉시 그 이유를 예측했고 회초리를 뻗어 더 조사했다.\\n\\u3000누나가 조에게 나를 내던지는 것으로 그 조사는 끝장이 났다.  나는  종종 부부간에 오고가는 미사일이 되곤 했으니까. 조는 어떤 의미에선 기뻐하며 나를 받았다. 그리곤 나를 굴뚝으로 옮기고는 자신의 거대한 다리로 나를 살짝 울타리 쳐 주었다.\\n\\u3000“당신의 그 장난꾸러기 녀석은 어딜 쏘다니다 온 거래?” 조 부인이  발을  쿵쾅거리며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“어서 말해.  어디 가서 뭘 하다  왔기에 나를 이렇게 속 태우고 놀래  고 불안해 달달볶게 만들었어. 말 못하면  그 구석에서  끄집어낼 줄  알 아. 만약 네가 오십 명의 핍(주인공이름)이고, 조(매형의 성씨)가 오백 명이나 되는 조가저리(매형의 이름)들이라면  말이야.”\\n\\u3000“교회 부속의 묘지에 갔다 왔을 뿐이라고.” 나는 발판(굴뚝  앞에  있  는 발판)에 앉아 울면서 맞은 데를 비비며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“교회 부속의 묘지라고!” 누나가 되받아쳤다. “넌 내가  아니었으면 벌써 오래전에 그 곳에 누워있었을 거야, 알아? 누가 너를 손수 길렀지?”\\n“누나가 길렀잖아.” 내가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“내가 너를 왜 길렀을까? 말해봐 나도 좀 알아야겠다!” 누나가 고함을 질렀다.\\n나는 흐느껴 울면서 말했다. “나는 모르지.”\\n\\u3000“나도 모르겠다!” 누나가 발끈했다. “내가 다시는  너를 키울 일은 없  을 거다. 암 그러고 말고. 네 녀석이 태어난 이후로 난 이 놈의 앞치마를 벗어본 적이  없었단  말이야. 알아?  네 녀석 엄마  역할로도 모자라  이 지겨운 대장장이의 아내 역할까지 맡아야했다고. 그 작자의 이름이 가저리(주인공의 매형)라지.”\\n\\u3000나는 불(벽난로 불)을 암담한 시선으로 바라보았다. 내 생각는 지금 누나가 말하고 있는 그러한 문제에서 빗겨나 있었다. “발목에 쇠사슬을 차고 늪지대에서 달아난 도망자, 미스터리한 젊은 남자, 줄(쇠사슬을 자를 수 있는 연장), 음식, 그리고 내가 이 안전한 건물(대장간)을 상대로 절도를 벌이기로 맹세한 그 무시무시한 서약.” 이러한 생각들이 복수의 석탄들 속에서 내 앞에서 솟아났다.\\n\\u3000“하!” 조  부인이 회초리를 제 위치에 놓아두면서 말했다. “교회 부속의 묘지, 그래! 당신들 둘 다 교회 부속의 묘지라고 말하는 것도 무리가 아니지.”\\n그건 그렇고, 우리 둘 중 한 명(매형)은 ‘교회 부속의 묘지’ 얘기를 꺼낸 적이 단 한 번도 없었다.\\n\\u3000“당신들 두 사람이 기어코 나를 교회 부속의 묘지로 몰아넣고 말거니까. 그럼 조만간, 아주 그냥 나 없이도 둘이 소중한 한 쌍이 되겠군!”\\n\\u3000누나가 찻그릇을 세팅하기 시작하자, 조(매형)가 자신의 다리 너머로 나를 살짝 내려다보았다. 그 행동은 마치 조가 머릿속으로 ‘나와 자신’을 캐스팅(배우에게 역을 맡김)해서는 누나가 미리 내다본 그 비통한 상황에 처하게 되면 우리가 실제 어떤 종류의 짝패(커플)가 될 수 있는지를 미루어 생각해보고 있는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000그 후, 조는 오른 쪽 얼굴에 있는 아마색(옅은 갈색)의 곱슬머리들과 구레나룻(얼굴 옆 수염)들을 손가락으로 만지며 앉았다. 물론 파란 눈 동자로는 조 부인을 유심히 지켜보고 있었다. 그는 폭풍우가 휘몰아칠 때면 항상 그렇게  행동했다.\\n\\u3000내 누나가 우리에게 줄 빵과  버터를 정확한 경계선을 따라 잘랐다. 그 선은 절대 다양해지는 법이 없었다.\\n\\u3000우선, 누나는 왼손으로 빵을 ‘가슴부근에 단 장식’에 단단히 재빨리 대고는 빵을 꼼짝달싹하지 못하게 만들었다. ‘가슴부근에 단 정사각형 장식’이라니? 누나가 늘 갖가지 핀들과 바늘들을 곱고 다니던 그 장식 말이다. 앞치마 위에 있는 것. 그래서 나중에는 그 핀들과 바늘들이 조와 내 입속으로 마구 들어가곤 했지만.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 누나는 버터를 조금 (절대 너무 많지는 않게) 나이프(칼) 위에 바르고는 그것을 약사들이 하는 방식대로 빵 위에 얇게 펴 발랐다. 그 모습은 마치 그녀가 회반죽(벽에 시멘트를 얇게 바름)을 바르고 있는 것만 같이  보였다.\\n\\u3000나이프 양쪽 면을 모두 사용해 날렵하고 민첩한 솜씨로 빵 껍질 둘레를 돌아가며 버터를 손질해서 모양을 냈다.\\n\\u3000그럼 다음 누나는, 회반죽의 가장자리에 마지막으로 깔끔하게 한 번썩 닦는 식으로, 빵 위에 나이프를 한 번 썩 딱은 후, 빵을 아주 두껍게 그것도 톱질하듯  잘랐다.\\n\\u3000이것이 누나가 빵을 갈라 우리(매형과 나)에게 나누어주기 전에 하는 누나의 방식이었다. 빵 한 조각은 조(매형)가 가지고 다른 하나는  내가 가지고.\\n\\u3000그때 당시 나는 배가 고팠다. 그렇지만 감히 내 몫의 빵조각을 먹을 수가 없었다. 내가 무시무시한 ‘내 지인’과 더 무시무시한 젊은 사람인 ‘그의 동료’를 위해 음식을 따로 남겨두어야 한다고 느꼈기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000조부인(주인공의 누나, 조는 남편  성씨)의  살림살이는  정말 엄격했다. 그래서 내가 나중에 도둑질을 위한 조사에 착수해도 금고(부엌 찬장)엔 아무것도 남아 있지 않을 수 있음을 잘 알고 있었다. 나는 일단  내 몫의 빵 한 덩어리를 바짓가랑이(바지구멍, 주인공은 지금 바짓가랑 이가 무릎 위까지 올라온 반바지를 입고 있음)위로 내려놓았다.\\n\\u3000이 목적을 완수하기 위해 정말 지독한 결단이  필요했다. 그것은 마치 내가 ‘아주 높은 집 꼭대기’에서 뛰어올라서는 곧장 ‘엄청 깊은 물 속’으로 쑤셔받는 것을 결심해야하는 것만 같았다. 아무것도 모르는 조 (매형) 때문에 그 일(누나 몰래 빵을 식탁위에서 무릎위로 내려놓기)을 완수하기가 한청 더  어려웠다.\\n\\u3000앞서 말했듯이 동병상련(누나에게 손바닥으로 매를 맞음)의 아픔을 공유하고 있는 동료순교자(피해자)라는 본능적인 유대와, 그리고 나에 대한 그의 온화한 우정에서 “우리는 저녁식사 때마다 빵을 한입씩 베어 물고 나서 ‘길이 난’(남은) 빵을 서로 비교하는 습관이 있었다.” 우린 때때로 빵을 집어 들고는 서로에게 감탄사를 조용히 지어보이곤 했다. 그런 습관(베어 물고 남은 빵을 서로 비교하기)은 서로의 식욕을 더욱  분발하게 했다.\\n\\u3000오늘 밤에도, 조는 “빠르게 줄어들고 있는 자신의 빵 조각을 보여주며 얼른 평소대로 우호적인 경쟁에 또 착수해보자”라며 몇 번이고 나에게 요구해왔다. 그러나 조는 매번, 한쪽 무릎 위에 노란 찻잔이 놓여 있고 다른 쪽 무릎위에는 손도 대지 않은 빵과 버터가 놓여있는 나를 발견할 뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000마침내 나는 자포자기식으로 생각하기에 이르렀다. 내가 지금 심사 숙고하고 있는 그 일을 해치워야겠다는 생각, 그리고 그것을 정말이지 전혀 일어날 성싶지 않은 방식대로 그것도 지금 이 상황과 가장 비슷한 방식대로 최선을 다해 해치워야한다는 자포자기식 생각에 나는 이르게 되었다.\\n\\u3000조가 나를 쳐다보았다. 그 순간 나는 ‘내 빵과 버터’를 다리 아래로 내려놓았다.(무릎 위에 있던 빵을 바닥에 내려놓았다)\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형)는 내  입맛이 없는 것을 보고 눈에 띄게 불편해했  다. 조가 자신의 빵조각을 한 입 베어 물곤 생각에 잠긴 표정을 지어 보였다. 그건 그가 즐겁지 않다는 뜻이었다.\\n\\u3000조는 빵조각을 입안에 넣고는 평소보다 훨씬 오랫동안 우물우물 입 안에서 빵을 돌렸다. 그리면서 빵을 상당히 곰곰이 생각해보는 것 같았다. 그런 후에야 마치 알약을 삼키듯 빵조각을 꿀꺽 삼켰다.\\n\\u3000조가 또 한 입을 베어 물었다. 빵을 좋은 자세로 먹으려고 고개를  한 쪽으로 기운 조의 시선이 나에게로 쏠렸을 때 조는 “내 빵과 버터가 한순간에 사라진 것”을  알아챘다.\\n\\u3000이제 막 빵을 한 입 물으려다말고 멈춘 조가 대경실색해했다. 그 표정이 너무 확연해 누나의 주목을 피할 수가 없었다.\\n“무슨 일이죠?” 누나가 컵을 세차게 내려놓으며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“아이고, 그러니까 있잖아!” 조가 낮고 불명확한 소리로 중얼거렸다. 나에게 아주 심각한 항의의 표시로 고개까지 흔들면서 말이다. “핍, 이봐 친구! 자신에게 장난을 쳐서는 안 돼. 목에 걸릴 수가 있으니까. 씹을 수가 없잖아, 핍.” (핍은 주인공의 이름임)\\n\\u3000“무슨 일이냐고?” 누나가 전보다 더 앙칼진(매우 높고 날카로운) 목 소리로 물었다.\\n\\u3000“조금이라도 기침을 할 수 있다면 토해내려무나, 핍. 나는 네가 그렇게 했으면 좋겠다.” 조가 계속해서 대경실색해하며 말했다. “식사예절도 예절이지만 네 건강도 여전히 중요하지 않겠니.”\\n\\u3000일이 이쯤 되자 누나는 아주 필사적이 되어선 조에게 잡자기 덤벼들어 조의 두 갈래 구레나룻(얼굴 옆 수염)을 잡고선 뒷벽에다 조의 머리를 잠시 동안  찧어댔다.(두드렸다)\\n\\u3000나는 구석에 앉은 채 이 모든 것을 마치 죄지은 것처럼 지켜보고 있 었다.\\n\\u3000“자 이래도 말을 하나 안하나 보자.”라며 누나가 가쁜 숨을 몰아쉬면서 말했다. “도살처지에 놓인 돼지 쳐다보듯이 빤히 쳐다만 보지 말고 말을 해 이  작자야.”\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형)가 누나를 무기력하게 바라봤다. 그리곤  빵을 한 조각 물고는 또 다시 나를 쳐다봤다.\\n\\u3000“너는 알지, 핍” 조가 뺨 안에 마지막 빵 한 조각을 다 털어넣으며 엄숙하게 그리고 자신에 찬 목소리로 말했다. 아주 그냥 우리 둘(조와 나)만 지금 이 자리에 있다는 눈치였다. “너와 난 항상 친구야, 그리고    난 어떤 경우에도 너를 고자질하진 않을 거야. 하지만 이번 경우엔…” 조가 의자를 옮기곤 우리 사이에 놓인 바닥 여기저기를 훑어보았다. 그리곤 또 내게로 시선을 고정시켰다. “특히 그 빵 만큼이나 가장 흔하지 않은 볼트(빵조각)를!” (영어동사 ‘볼트’에는 “음식을  삼키다”란 뜻도 있음)\\n“뭐 이 녀석이 음식을 송두리째 삼켰다고?” 누나가 소리쳤다.\\n\\u3000“이봐 친구, 알지.” 조가 조부인은 쳐다보지 않고 나를 쳐다보며 여전히 뺨 한가득 빵 조각을 베어 문채로 계속 말을 했다. “나도 네 나 이만할 때는 빵을 꿀꺽 꿀꺽 삼키기도 했었단다.  그런  일이  자주 있었 지. 그리고 내가 아직 소년일 때는 내 주위에도 그런 ‘꿀꺽 이들’이 참 많았단다. 하지만 난 지금까지 네가 먹은 빵 크기만큼이나 많은 빵을     한 순간에 꿀꺽하는 사람은 본 적이 없었단다, 핍. 네가 그걸(빵) 꿀꺽 하고도 죽지 않은 게  천만다행이구나.”\\n\\u3000누나는 내게로 달려와선 내 머리채를 움켜쥐고선 이보다 더 지독한  말은 없을 그런 소리를 하는 것이다. “이리와, 약부터 먹자.”\\n\\u3000그때 당시 어떤 짐승 같은 의사가 ‘타르(석유, 발암물질)에 물을 탄 혼합물’을 좋은 약이라며 부활시켰었다. 그리고 조 부인(주인공의 누나)은 그 ‘타르 수용액 일정량’을 찬장에 꼭 비치해두고 있었다. 누나는 ‘타르 수용액’의 그 불결함에 상응하는 효능이  그 안에 있을 것이  라고  믿고 있었다.\\n\\u3000상황이 가장 좋았을 때조차도, 이 만병통치약(타르 수용액)은 탁월한 강장제(보신탕)로써 너무도 많은 양이 나에게 투여되었고 그러면 나는 새로 칠한 울타리에서 나는 냄새 같은 것을 계속해서 의식하며 돌아다 녀야했다.\\n\\u3000이날의 특별한 저녁에도 내 문제에 대한 응급조치의 일환으로 이 혼합물 600밀리리터(우유3팩 용량)가 투여되었다. 누나는 장화 벗는 기구에 장화를 끼우듯이 자기 팔에 내 머리를 끼우고는 내 목에 그 혼합물을 쏟아 붓기 시작했다. 순전히 내 더 큰 편안함을 위한다는 구실에 서였다.\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형)는 300밀리리터( ㎖ )를 마시고 풀려났지만 그걸 삼 켜야했다. 그걸 먹은 조는 속이 뒤틀려서는 천천히 빵을 우적우적 씹으며 불 앞에 가만히 앉아 묵상(마음속으로 생각)에 잠겨 있었다. 누나는 그 모습을 보곤 “그가 먹었었던 것(빵)이 탈이 나서”라고 말을 했지만, 순전히 내 판단에 따르건대 그가 속이 뒤틀린 것은 약을 먹고  나서의 일이라고 확실히 말할 수 있다. 그 놈의 약을 먹기 전에는 아무런  탈이 없었다.\\n\\u3000어른이든 소년이든 양심의 가책에 시달린다는 것은 굉장히 무서운 일이다. 그러나 소년의 경우에는, 그 비밀스러운 짐(양심)이 바짓가랑이 아래쪽에 있는 또 다른 비밀스러운 짐(빵)과 합쳐졌을 경우에는 내가 증언하건대 그것은 실로 굉장히 무서운 형벌이 된다. \\n\\u3000나는 결코 내가 조(매형)에게서 도둑질을 한다고는 생각하지 않았다. 왜냐하면 집안 물건들이 그의 것이라고 생각해 본 적이 단 한 번도 없었기 때문이다. 내가 조부인(결혼한 누나)에게서 도둑질을 하려하고 있다는 “죄의식”은 내가 한 손으로 빵과 버터를 계속 쥐고 있어야할 “필요성”과 합쳐져 거의 나를 미치기 일보직전까지 몰아넣고 있었다. 나는 앉아 있을 때나 잔심부름을 받고 부엌을 이리저리 돌아다닐 때에도 손에서 빵과 버터를 놓지  않았다.\\n\\u3000그때 늪지대에서 불어온 바람이 불(벽난로 불)을  발갛게 만들었다. 불이 확 타올랐다. 그 순간 나는 밖에서 누가 말하는 것을 들은 것만 같았다. 그 목소리는 나에게 비밀맹세를 강요한, 다리에 쇠사슬을 찬 남성의 목소리였다. 그 목소리는 마치 내게 “나는 내일까지 굶을 수도 없고 굶지도  않을 것이다. 지금 당장  먹을 것을  내 놓아라.”라고 말하는  것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000어떤 때는 이런 생각도 들었다. 만약 자기 손을 내 피로 더럽히는 것을 제지당하고 있는 그 젊은 사나이가 체질적인 성급함에 굴복한 나머지 시간을 착각해 오기로 한 내일이 아니라 오늘 밤 당장 내 심장과  간을 뜯어먹기 위해  파견된다면!\\n\\u3000만약 공포에 사로잡힌 사람의 머리카락이 곤두설 수 있다면, 아마도 그때 당시 내 머리카락이 그랬을 것이 틀림없다. 그러나 아마도, 누구의 머리카락도 그런 식으로 곤두선 적은 없지 않았을까?\\n\\u3000그날은 크리스마스 이브였다. 그래서 나는 다음 날 쓸 푸딩(서양 생 과자, 물렁물렁)을 저어야했다. ‘네덜란드 시계’(서양영화에서 자주 보이는 벽시계)로 7시부터 8시까지 구리 막대기로  푸딩을  저어야했다. 나는 다리에 짐(빵과 버터)을 달고서 푸딩을 저으려고 애섰다. 그게 쉬운 일이 아니었다. 빵과 버터가 내 발목에서 삐져나오려는 운동성향을 보였기 때문이다. 여간 다루기 어려운 게 아니었다.\\n\\u3000운이 좋게도 나는 빠져나와, ‘내 양심의 일부분’(누나에게서 빼돌린 빵과 버터)을 내 침실 다락방에 놓아둘 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“들어봐요!” 푸딩 젖기를 다 마치고, 잠자리에 들기 전 벽난로의 구석에 앉아 마지막 남은 불씨의 온기를 쬐고 있을 때 내가 말했다. “대포소리였지, 조(매형)?”\\n“아!” 조가 말했다. “죄수가 또 한 명 탈출했나보다.”\\n\\u3000“죄수가 뭐야, 조?” 내가 물었다. (잠깐 앞뒤 설명 : 여기서 말하는 ‘죄수’는, 배 위에 있는 선상감옥에서 막 탈출한 ‘두 번째 죄수’를 말하는 것임. 첫 번째 죄수는 앞에서 나온 “내일까지 빵과 버터 가져오라” 며 주인공을 겁먹인 그 사나이임. 두 죄수가 원수지간임. 헷갈리시면 안됨.^^;;)\\n\\u3000설명을 도맡아 해온 ‘조 부인’(주인공의 결혼한 누나)이 딱딱거리며 말했다. “도망갔다고. 도망간 거라고. 이 녀석아.”라며 ‘타르 수용액’ (석유에 물 탄 액체)의 선명도(검정색)같은 설명을 하는 것이다.\\n\\u3000조 부인이 그녀의 바느질감 위로 몸을 구부리며 앉아 있는 동안, 나는 입모양만으로 말을 하며 조에게 물었다. “죄수가 뭐야?, 조.” 조가  아주 정성들여서 만든 대답을 입모양만으로 들려주었다. 그런데 뭔 소린지  하나도  모르겠고  “핍”이라는  단어  딱  하나만  알아들을  수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“어제 저녁에도 죄수가 한 명 도망쳤단다.” 조가 큰 소리로 말했다. “해가 지고 쏘는 대포소리가 들리고, 경고사격이 있었지. 지금 또 다른 죄수가 도망치니까 또 경고사격을 하는 것 같구나.”\\n“누가 쏘는데?” 내가  물었다.\\n\\u3000“저런 괘씸한 녀석!” 누나가 끼어들었다. 그리곤 바느질 감 너머로 눈살을 찌푸리며 나를 노려보았다. “저 녀석 정말 질문덩어리네. 질문 하지마, 거짓말만 듣게 될 거니까.”\\n\\u3000누나의 그런 행동은 그녀 자신에게도 무척 예의 없는 행동이었다. 적어도 내 생각에는 그랬다. 내가 질문을  해도  그녀에게서  거짓말만 잔뜩 듣게 될 거라니. 누나는 손님이 있을 때를 빼고는 한 번도 예의 있었던  적이 없었지만.\\n\\u3000이때 조(주인공의 매형)가 자기 입을 고통스러울 정도로 아주 크게 벌리면서 무슨 말을 입모양만으로 하는 바람에 내 호기심이 엄청나게 커졌다. 그건 “부루퉁하다(못마땅하고 성난 빛이 있어)”라는 단어인 것 같았다. 그래서 나도 당연 ‘조 부인’(결혼한 누나)을 가리키며 입모양 만으로 이렇게 말했다. “누나가요?” 하지만 조는 내 말을 전혀 들으려 고도 하지 않고 다시 입을 아주 크게 벌리곤 입모양만으로 단어 하나를 아주 강조해서 흔드는 것이다. 도대체 뭔 소린지 알아들을 수가 없 었다.\\n\\u3000“조부인” 내가 말했다. 기댈 때는 누나밖에 없었으니까. “알고 싶은게 있는데요. 아주 많이 꺼림칙하시지만 않으시다면 말이죠. 대포소리는 어디서 들려오는  거예요?”\\n\\u3000“오 하느님, 저 딴 녀석에게 축복을 내리소서!” 누나가 고함을 지러 댔다. 축복은커녕 마치 그 반대되는 의미인 것 같았다. “감옥선(배)에서  나는 소리잖아!”\\n“오호~!” 내가 조를 바라다보며 말했다. “감옥선이였구나! 조.” \\n\\u3000조(매형)가 나를 책망하는 듯이 기침을 한 번 해보였다. 그것은 마치 “음, 내가 그렇게 말했잖니.”라고 말하려는 듯 보였다.\\n“그리고 제발, 감옥선(배)이 뭔지도 말해죠?” 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이게 저 녀석이 쓰는 방법이라니까!”라며 누나가 고함을 질러댔다. 누나는 쥐고 있던 바늘과 실로 나를 꼭 지목하고는 고개까지 흔들면서 이렇게 말했다. “저 녀석 질문에 하나를 답해주면 곧장 열두 개의 질   문을 도로 내게 던지지. 감옥선(배)은 죄수들이 타는 배야, ‘올가미’(도구) 바로 건너편에 있는 것 있잖니.” 우리 시골에서는 ‘늪지대’를 항상 ‘올가미’이라고 불렀다. (앞뒤설명 : 늪지대를 “올가미”라고 하는 이유가 소설 후반부에 다시 나옴. 주인공이 정말 나쁜 악당의 속임수에 빠져 일생일대의 위험에 처하게 장소가 바로 이곳 늪지대에서임. 소설에 나오는 수많은 복선들 중에 하나임)\\n\\u3000“나도 궁금하다고, 감옥선(배)에는 누가 들어가는지, 그들이 왜 거기로 들어가는지?” 내가 대체로 조용한 절망감을 느끼며 말했다.\\n\\u3000이런 행동(주인공의 궁금증 폭발)은 ‘조 부인’(주인공의 누나)이 보았을 때 너무 나간 것이었다. 누나는 즉시 일어났다. “있잖아, 젊은 친 구.”라며 그녀가 계속 말했다. “내가 너를 손수 키운 것은 네가 질문공 세를 퍼부어 남들을 괴롭히라는 것이 아니었어. 만약 내가 널 그런 질 문공세나 하며 남들을 괴롭히라고 너를 손수 키웠다면 그건 나를 칭찬 하는 것이 아니라 모욕하는 거야. 사람들이 그곳에 가는 이유는 죄를 지었기 때문이야. 그리고 사람을 죽였기 때문에 그리고 도둑질을 했기 때문에 위조지폐를 만들었기 때문에 그리고 여타 온갖 나쁜 짓들을 저 질렀기 때문에 감옥선(배)에 들어가는 거라고. 그리고 그 사람들(범죄 자들)이 애초 어떻게 그 나쁜 짓들에 발을 들이게 되었는지 아니? 너처럼 질문공세를 시작하면서부터야. 자, 이제 올라가 잠이나 자! 이 녀석아.”\\n\\u3000누나는 내가 촛불을 들고서 침대(다락방에 있는  침대)로  올라가는 것을 허락하지 않았다. 나는 껌껌한 어둠 속에서 계단을 하나씩 밟으며 올라갔다. 머리가 따끔따끔 거리고 있었다. “자, 이 녀석아 올라가  어서 잠이나 자!”라는 누나 자신의 마지막 말에 리듬을 넣기 위해 ‘조 부인’이 골무(바느질할 때 손가락에 끼는 헝겊)로 내 머리 위를 탬버린 (음악도구) 연주하듯 두들겼기 때문이다. 그때 나는 감옥선(배)이 내게 가까이 있는 것이 아주 다행이라고 느꼈다. 무서워서 벌벌 떨면서도 말이다.\\n\\u3000나는 분명 질문을 시작함으로써 그곳(감옥선)을 향해 나아가고 있었고 그리고 이제는 ‘조 부인’(누나)에게서 도둑질까지 하려고 하고 있으니까.\\n\\u3000지금으로부터 충분히 먼 과거의 일이 되었지만 그때부터 나는 공포에 휩싸인 어린이에게 얼마나 많은 비밀이 있을 수 있는지 아는 사람은 그리 많지 않으리라는 것을 종종 생각하곤 했었다. 그 공포가 비이 성적일지라도 상관이 없었다. 말이 안 되다는 것 그 자체가 바로 그것이 공포가 될 수 있다는 증거니까.\\n\\u3000나는 내 심장과 간을 원하는 ‘젊은  남자’에 대한 극심한 공포에 휩싸여 있었다. 나는 족쇄(다리에 찬 쇠사슬)를 찬 내 ‘교섭 담당자’(빵과 버터를 가져오라고 시킨 남자)에 대한 극심한 공포에 휩싸여 있었다.  나는 그런 지독한 약속을 꺼낸 내 자신에 대해서도 극심한 공포심을 느끼고 있었다.\\n\\u3000사사건건 나를 무찌르는 전능한 내 누나를 통하더라도 구원에의 여지가 전혀 보이지 않았다. 공포라는 비밀에 휩싸여 있던 나는, 시키는 것이라면 뭐든지 해냈을 것이라는 생각이 들면 나는 지금도 두려움을 느낀다.\\n\\u3000그날 밤 내가 조금이라도 잠을 잘 수 있었다면, 그것은 거센 ‘한사 리’(밀물이 가장 높이 들어오는 때)  위에 실려, 감옥선(배)을 향해, 강을 따라 떠내려가는 내 자신을 상상한 것에 지나지 않았다.\\n\\u3000교수대  옆을 지나가고 있는 내게 ‘유령 같은 해적’이 나타나선 “차라리 육지로 올라와 저기(교수대)서 한 번 목매 달리는 것이 좋을 테니 망설이지 말라”며 확성기로 외쳐대고  있었다.\\n\\u3000심지어 나는 잠을 자고 싶다고 느낄 때조차도  잠이 무서웠다. 나는  알고 있었다. 아침의 첫 번째 희미한 새벽이 오면 내가 식료품 저장실을  털어야한다(도둑질)는 것을.\\n\\u3000밤에는 그것(도둑질)이 불가능했다. 그 당시에는 간단한 마찰로 불을 밝힐 수 있는 방법이 없었다. 불을 밝히려면 내가 ‘부싯돌’과 ‘강철’을  서로 부딪쳐 불을 밝혀야했었음이 틀림없는데, 그러면 쇠사슬들을 덜거덕거리던 바로 그 해적에게서 나던 소리를 내가 만들어야했음이 틀림없었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000내 작은 창문 밖에서 거대한 검은 “벨벳(표면에 연한 섬유털이 치밀하게 심어진 천) 장막”(즉 밤의 장막)이 회색빛을 띄자마자, 나는 일어나 계단을 밟고 내려갔다. 내려가는 매 ‘판자’(계단의 판자)마다, 그리고 그 판자에 난 금(깨진 금)  사이마다 “거기  서라  이 도둑놈아!” 그리고 “어서 일어나시오, 조 부인(주인공의 누나)!”라고 부르는  소리가  나를  뒤쫓고 있었다.\\n\\u3000식료품 저장실에 도착했다. 평상시보다 음식이 훨씬 많이 있었다. 명 절(크리스마스) 때문이었다. 발뒤꿈치를 위로 향한 채 매달려 있는 산 토끼를 보았을 때 나는 놀라자빠질 뻔 했다. 내가 몸을 반쯤 돌렸을 때 그 산토끼가 내게 윙크하는 것을 내가 본 것 같다는 생각까지 들었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그것을 확인할 시간도 없었거니와, 음식을 고를 시간도 없었고, 딴 것에 정신 팔 시간이 없었다. 나에게는 여분의 시간이 전혀 없었다. 나는 빵을 조금 훔쳤다. 치즈 껍질도 조금 훔쳤다. 민스미트(‘말린 과일과 양념 등등’을 섞어 놓은 것. 파이 속에 넣는 재료) 반병도 훔쳤다. 나는 이것들을 지난밤에 훔친 ‘빵과 버터’와 함께 내 휴대용 손수 건에 싼 후 묶었다. ‘돌로 만든 술병’(도자기 같이 안이 전혀 안 보이는 병, 고려청자 같은 것) 안에 있던 브랜디(포도주를 증류한 술)도 조 금 훔쳤다. 스페인 감초주(감초 달인 물)라는 이름의 사람 취하게 만드는 액체를 만들 때 내가 몰래몰래 내 방으로 가져가 사용하고 하던 유리병 안에 브랜디를 담았다. ‘돌로 만든 술병’ 안에는 부엌 찬장에 있 던 주전자에 있던 것을 부어 희석시켰다. 고기가 거의 붙어 있지 않은 뼈도 하나 훔쳤다. 그리고 둥글고 아름다운 모양을 한 속이 꽉 찬 돼\\n지고기 파이도 하나  훔쳤다.\\n\\u3000나는 그 파이를 그냥 지나칠  뻔 했다.  그러나 나는 선반을 하나 밟고 올라가서 구석 한쪽에 그토록 조심스럽게 뚜껑이 덮여 있는 큰 도기 접시 안에 도대체 무엇이 담겨 있는지 들여다보고 싶은 유혹을 떨 쳐버릴 수 없었다. 나는 그것이 파이(구운 과자)라는 것을 금세 알아챘다. 훔치면서 나는 이런 생각을 했다. ‘제발 금방 사용할 파이가 아니기를, 그래서 꽤 오랫동안은 파이 하나가 사라진 사실이 들통 나지 않기를.’\\n\\u3000부엌에는 대장간으로 통하는 문이 하나 있었다. 나는 그 문의 자물쇠를 열고 빗장을 열어젖혔다. 조(매형, 대장장이)의 연장(도구)들 사이에서 줄(쇠사슬을 자르는 연장) 하나를 챙겼다. 그런 다음 나는 처음 보았던 대로 자물쇠와 빗장을 제 위치에 둔 후(잠근 후) 내가 어제 밤에 집으로 뛰어 들어왔을 때 열어두었던 그 문을 연 후 다시  문을 닫 고는 안개가 자욱한 늪지대를 향해 뛰기 시작했다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 3장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000서리가 하얗게 덮인 아침이었다. 습기가 축축하게 찬 아침이기도 했다. 내 작은 창문 바깥에 습기가 차서 얼룩이  생겨있었다.  그  얼룩은 마치 악귀(나쁜 귀신)가 내 창문에서 밤새 울부짖으며 내 창문을 휴대용 손수건으로 사용한 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000습기는 이제 횅댕그렁한(넓은 공간이 비워 있어 쓸쓸한) 울타리들과 마른 잔디 위에 수북이 쌓여 있었다. 마치 거친 거미줄이 쳐져 있는것 같았다. 이 나무의 잔가지에서 저 나무의 잔가지로, 이 잎에서 저 잎으로 습기가 주렁주렁 매달려 있었다.\\n\\u3000난간 위와 통로 위마다 기분 나쁠 정도로 축축하게 젖어 있었다. 늪 지대의 안개가 너무 짙었다. 사람들에게 우리 마을의 위치를 알려주는, ‘위치표시용 말뚝 위’에 놓인 ‘나무 손가락’ 바로 아래에 도착할 때까지 말뚝이 보이지  않았다.\\n\\u3000그 때 내가 말뚝 위 ‘나무 손가락’을 올려다보았다. 그것에선 물을 뚝뚝 떨어지고 있었다. 마치 나를 감옥선(배로)으로 헌납하는 환영 같았다. 그것이 학대받고 있는 내 양심 같았다.\\n\\u3000내가 늪지대를  마저 빠져 나왔을 때 안개는 훨씬 더 짙어진 상태였다. 그  바람에 내가 주변 모든  것들을 향해 달려가고 있는 것이 아니라, 주변 모든 것들이 나를 향해 달려오는 있는 것 같이 느껴졌다. 이것은 그렇지 않아도 양심의 가책을 느끼고 있던 내 마음을 아주 불쾌하게 만들었다.\\n\\u3000수문들(물의 흐름을 통제하는 수문)과 제방들과 강둑들이 안개를 뚫으며 나에게로 넘칠 듯 달려오고 있었다. 마치 그것들이 나를 향해  이렇게 분명히 소리치는 것 같았다. “누군가 다른 사람의 돼지고기 파이를 가지고 있는 소년이다! 저 소년을 멈춰 세워라!”라고.\\n\\u3000소들이 갑자기 나를 발견했다. 소들이 눈으로  나를  노려보며  코로 김을 내고 있었다. “쉿, 이 어린 도둑놈아! 쉿! 쉿!”\\n\\u3000어깨 위에 ‘하얀 삼각형의 근육’을 가지고 있는 ‘검은 황소 한 마리’ 가 두 눈으로 나를 아주 완고하게 바라보고 있었다. 내가 빙 돌아가는 만큼이나 비난하는 듯한 태도로 자신의 무딘 고개를 나에게 시선을 고정시킨 채 빙 돌리고 있었다. 그 검은 황소는 심지어 내 양심을 깨우는 성직자 같은 인상을 가지고 있었다. 나는 황소에게 울면서 이렇게 말을 해야 했다. “어쩔 수 없었어요, 어르신! 나 자신을 위해서 이걸 가지고 가는 게 아니라고요.”\\n\\u3000‘검은 황소’는 고개를 숙이고는 콧구멍으로 한줄기 연기구름을 내뿜었다. 그 검은 황소는 두 뒷다리들을 한 차례 위로 차올리고는 꼬리를 한 번 휘젓더니 이내 사라졌다.\\n\\u3000계속해서 나는 강  쪽으로 접근하고  있었다. 하지만  내가 아무리 빨리 달려도 내 발들은 따뜻해지지 않았다. 내가 지금 만나러 가는 사나 이의 다리에 고정되어 있던 그 쇠사슬(족쇄)처럼, 내 발들도 차가운 습 기에 단단히 고정되어있는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000나는 포대(포병대 시설물)쪽으로 곧장 나아가는 길을 알고 있었다. 왜냐하면 일요일이면 조(주인공의 매형)와 함께 포대 아래쪽까지 가보곤 했었기 때문이다. 그럴 때면 조(매형)는 오래된 대포 위에 걸쳐 앉아 내게 “네가 정식으로 내 도제(배우는 직공)가 되면 우린 저기서 즐겁게 놀 수 있을 거야!”라고 말했었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 나는 내가 포대 오른 쪽으로 너무 많이 지나쳐왔다는 것을 알았다. 자욱한 안개 때문에  길을 혼동한 것이다. 그  결과 나는 “썰물을 표시해둔 말뚝들”과 “진흙” 너머로 마음대로 돌아다니는 그 돌투성 이인 강둑 위쪽의 “강변”을 따라 되돌아가야했다.\\n\\u3000온갖 역경에도 불구하고 이쪽 방향으로 해서 내 길을 만들고 있던 내가 막 도랑(작고 폭이 좁은 개울) 하나를 건넜을 때였다. 나는 아주 가까이에 포대(포병대가 버리고 간 시설물)가 있다는 사실을 잘 알고 있었다. 내가 막 도랑을 지나고 언덕을 마저 기어올랐을 때였다. 내 앞 쪽에 앉아 있는 그 사나이가 보였다.\\n\\u3000그는 등을 내 쪽으로 하고 앉아 있었다. 그는 자신의 양팔로 자기 몸을 감싸 앉은 채 깊은 잠에 빠져 고개를 앞쪽으로 “끄덕끄덕”거리고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 생각했다. ‘만약 아침 식사를 가지고 온 내가, 이런 뜻밖의 방식으로 그와 우연히 만나게 된다면 그가 훨씬 더 기뻐할 것이다’라는 생각이 들었다. 그래서 나는 조용히 앞쪽으로 나아가 그의 어깨 위에 가만히 손을 얹었다. 그가 즉시 벌떡 일어섰다. 이런 젠장 그는 내가 어제저녁에 만났던 그 사나이가 아니었다. 전혀 딴 남성이었다.\\n\\u3000그럼에도 불구하고 이 남성은  ‘거친  회색  옷’(죄수복)을  입고 있었다. 그리고 다리엔 큰 쇠사슬(족쇄)을 차고 있었으며 무엇보다 다리를 절고 있었다. 목에선 쉰 소리가 나고 있었으며 추위에 떨고 있었다. 내가 어제저녁에 만났던 그 사나이와 모든 차림새가 닮았었다. 단지 동일한 얼굴이 아닐 뿐이었다. 그리고 또 하나 “편평하고 폭이 넓은 테 두리가 있으며 춤이 낮은 펠트”(말이 어렵죠? 저도 제가 써놓고도 무슨 말인지 모르겠네요. 부드럽고 두꺼운 천으로 만든 ‘죄수모자’를 말 한다고 하네요)를 얼굴 위에 쓰고 있다는 사실이 어제저녁에 내가 만났던 그 사나이와  달랐다.\\n\\u3000이 모든 것을 나는 순식간에  보았다. 왜냐하면 그를 쳐다볼 시간이  그 순식간밖엔 없었기 때문이다. 그는 나에게 욕설을 한마디 내뱉고는 나를 향해 주먹을 내질렀다. 그의 주먹은 둥근 원을 그렀지만 약해보였고 무엇보다 나를 맞추지도 못했다. 그러다 그는 혼자서 넘어졌다.  내게 주먹질을 하려다 그만 발끝의 뾰족한 부분이 걸렸기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 그는 안개 속으로 뛰어 들어갔다. 그는 가다가 두 번씩이나 발끝의 뾰족한 부분이 걸려 넘어졌다. 이내 그가 내 시선에서 완전히 사라졌다.\\n\\u3000“그 젊은 사나이인가!”라는 생각이 들었다. 갑자기 내 심장에서 찌릿 찌릿 통증이 느껴졌다. 적어도 나는 그렇게 생각했다. 감히 말하건대, 만약 내가 간이 내 몸 어디에 위치해있는지를 알았더라면 나는 간에서도 그와 같은 강도의 통증을 느껴야 했을 것이다.\\n\\u3000그 후 나는 곧 포대(포병대가 버리고 간 시설물)에 도착할 수 있었다. 제대로 찾아왔다. 그 사람이 나를 기다리고 있었기 때문이다. 자신의 두 팔로 자기 몸뚱이를 끌어앉은 채 앞뒤로 다리를 절며 움직이고 있는 그 사람. 그는 마치 밤새도록 그 포옹과 절뚝거림을 멈추지 않은 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000틀림없다. 그는 몹시도 추위에 떨고 있었다. 그가 내 얼굴 앞에서 쓰 러져 이 지독한 추위에 그만 죽어버리는 줄 알았다.\\n\\u3000내가 그에게 줄(쇠사슬을 자르는 도구)을 건네주었다. 그가 그 줄을 잔디위에 내려놓았다. 그의 두 눈이 너무 지독히도 배가 고파보였기 때문에, 혹시 내가 들고 간 보따리를 그가 보지 못했다면 그 줄을 먹 어치우는 것은 아닐까? 하는 생각이 문득 들었다.\\n\\u3000내가 가진 것들을 빼앗기 위해 이번엔 그가 나를 거꾸로 들어 올리      진 않았다.\\n\\u3000그는 내가 보따리를 풀고 내 호주머니들을 몽땅 비울 때까지,  나를  자기 오른쪽 옆에 똑바른 자세 그래도 두었다.\\n “병에 든 것이 뭐냐, 꼬마야?” 그가 말했다. “브랜디(포도주를 증류한 술)에요, 아저씨” 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000그가 ‘민스미트’(‘말린 과일과 양념 등등’을 섞어 놓은 것. 파이 속에 넣는 재료)를 가장 흥미로운 방식으로 자기 목구멍 속으로 밀어 넣고 있었다. 그 모습은 마치 그가 민스미트를 먹고 있는 것이 아니라 어떤 격렬한 배고픔에 사로잡힌 사람이 어딘가로 민스미트를 마구 집어넣고 있는  모습 같았다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그런 그도 술을 마실 때는 잠깐씩 멈추었다. 그는 술을 약간 마셨다. 그는 먹는 내내 격렬하게 떨고 있었다. 너무나 격렬히 몸을 떠는 바람에 그의 이빨들 사이로 병의 목을 가만히 대고 있는 것도 어려 워보였다. 병의 목을 물어끊지 않은 게 다행이었다.\\n\\u3000“제 생각에는 오한(몸에 열이 나고 춥고 떨림)에 걸리신 것 같아요, 아저씨.”  내가 말했다.\\n“나도 같은 생각이다, 꼬마야” 그가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이 근처는 공기가 나빠요.” 내가 그에게 말했다. “늪지대 위에 누워 계셨죠, 지독한 오한을 일으키는데 늪지대는, 여기서 자다가 류머티즘에 걸린 사람도  있어요.”\\n\\u3000“그 놈들에게 걸려 얼어 죽기 전에 나는 지금 아침부터 좀 먹어야겠다.” 그가 말했다. “그런 다음 곧장 저기 저 교수대들에 한 줄로 매달린다고 하더라도 난 지금 좀 먹어두어야겠다. 그때까지는 이 추위를 이겨낼 테다. 내가  장담하마.”\\n\\u3000그는 “민스미트, 고기 뼈, 빵, 치즈 그리고 돼지고기 파이” 이 모든 것들을 동시에 모조리 먹어치우고 있었다. 그러면서도 한시도 맘을 놓지  못하고  안개  속과 우리 주변을 불신의  눈으로  응시하고 있었다. 또 종종 씹는 것까지 멈추고는 무언가에 귀를 기울이곤 했다.\\n\\u3000진짜 어떤 소리인지 혹은 상상의 어떤 소리인지, 강 위에서 어떤 쨍 그랑하는 소리인지 혹은  늪지대에서  어느  짐승이  내뿜는  숨소리인지 알 수 없는 소리가 들리자, 그는 깜짝 놀라했다.\\n그러더니 그가 느닷없이 내게  말했다.\\n\\u3000“너 설마 날 속이러 온 임프(꼬마정도의 키를 가진 악당요정, 사람을 도와줄 때에도 나쁜 음모를 꾸미는 나쁜 요정)는 아니지? 아무도 안 데려왔겠지?”\\n“아무도 안 데려왔어요, 아저씨!  아무도!”\\n“네 놈 뒤를 몰래 밟으라고 사람을 붙이는 자는 없었니?” “없었어요!”\\n\\u3000“좋아.” 그가 말했다.  “너를  믿겠다.  만약  네  나이  또래의 아이가, 나 같이 가난하고 불행한 빌어먹을 기생충 같은 인간을 뒤쫓는 것을 돕는다면, 비열한 사냥개 새끼일  뿐이니까!”\\n\\u3000그가 말을 할 때마다 “찰깍”거리는 어떤 소리가 났다. 마치 그의 목에 시계가 있어 조만간 “따르릉”거리며 시간을 알려줄 것 같았다.\\n그가 누더기 같이 거친 소매로 두 눈 위를 문질렀다.\\n\\u3000그의 쓸쓸함을 동정하면서, 그리고 그가 점차 안정을 되찾아가면서 돼지고기 파이를 먹는 모습을 지켜보면서, 나는 간이 배 밖으로 나와선 이렇게 물는 것이다. “맛있게 드시니 기뻐요, 아저씨.”라고.\\n“뭐라고?”\\n“아저씨가 맛있게 드시니 기쁘다고 말했어요.” “고맙다, 얘야. 정말  고맙구나.”\\n\\u3000나는 우리 집 큰 개가 음식을 먹는 모습을 종종 지켜보곤 했었다.  이제 보니, “우리 집 큰 개가 음식을 먹는 모습”과 “이 사나이가 식사를 하는 모습” 사이에는 분명한 유사점이 있었다. 내가 가만 보니. 이 사나이도 강하게 날카롭게 갑작스럽게 음식을 물어뜯었고 그런 모습은 우리 집 큰 개와  같았다.\\n\\u3000그는 삼키거나, 또는 오히려 너무 일찍 너무 빨리 한 입 가득 음식을 물어뜯었다. 그러면서도 먹는 내내 여기 저기 옆쪽을 쳐다보는 것을 잊지 않았다. 마치 사방팔방으로 위험요소가 있다고 그가 생각하는 것만 같았다. 마치 누군가가 자신의 돼지고기 파이를 훔쳐가기 위해 접근하고 있다고 그가 생각하고 있는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그 때문인지 그의 마음은 아주 불안정해보였다.  지금  그의  마음이 너무  불안정해서,  내  생각에는  그가  음식  맛도  마음  편히  평가할 수 없거니와, 방문자를 자신의 턱으로 절단해버리지 않고서는 남과 식사를 같이 할 수 있을 것 같지도 않아보였다. 이와 같은 모든 요소들을 감안해 보건데 그 사나이는 영락없이 우리 집 큰 개와 아주 닮았다.\\n\\u3000“그 아저씨 몫으론 아무것도 안 남기시네요. 안 됐어요.” 내가 소심하게 말했다. 잠깐의 침묵이 흐른 후 나는 말까지 더듬어가며 되는대로 공손하게 이렇게 말하는 것도 잊지  않았다.  “음식  가져온 곳에선 이제 더  이상 가져 올 게  없거든요.” 나로 하여금 이런 힌트까지 그에게 주게 만든 것은 십중팔구 그게 사실이었기 때문이다. 부엌에서 더 가져올 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000“그를 위해 남겨줄 게 없다니? 그게 누군데?” 내 친구가 파이껍질을 “아작아작” 씹다 말고  말했다.\\n\\u3000“그 젊은 분요. 어제 말씀하셨잖아요. 아저씨와 함께 숨어있다는 그 분요.”\\n\\u3000“아하!” 그가 우락부락한 웃음 같은 어떤 감정을 드러내 보이며 대꾸했다. “그 사람 말이지? 그래, 그렇겠지! 그 놈은 이제 빵을 전혀 바라지  않으니 걱정마라.”\\n“아닌데요.  그  분도  엄청  배고파  보이던데요.”라고  내가  말했다. 그가  먹는  것을  딱 멈추고서  나를  쳐다보았다. 그  눈빛은 이 세상에\\n서 가장 날카로운 의혹의 눈초리, 이 세상에서 가장 놀란 표정이 담긴 눈빛이었다. 그는 그런 표정으로 나를 쳐다보았다.\\n“누굴  봤다는  거냐? 언제?”\\n“방금 전이요.”\\n“어디서?”\\n\\u3000“저곳에서요.” 내가 손가락으로 저쪽을 가리키며 말했다. “저쪽에요, 저기. 제가 그 분을 봤을 때 꾸벅꾸벅 졸고 계시던걸요, 전 그 분이 아 저씨이신  줄 알았거든요.”\\n\\u3000그가 내 멱살을 잡아당겼다. 그가 나를 빤히 쳐다보았다. 나는 그가  내게 처음 했었던 그 말 “네 녀석의 모가지를 따 주겠다.”라는 말을 떠올리기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000“아저씨처럼 옷을 입고 있었어요. 아시잖아요. 그 옷. 다만 그 분은 모자를 쓰고 있었어요.” 내가 달달  떨면서 설명하기  시작했다. “그리고, 그리고요.” 나는 조바심을 내며 아주 조심스럽게 이 말을 덧붙였다. “그리고 줄(쇠사슬을 자르는 데 사용하는 연장)을 빌리고 싶어 할 똑같은 이유가 있어보였어요. 어젯밤 대포소리 못 들으셨어요?”\\n“그렇지 어제 사격이 있었지!” 그가 스스로에게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그 소리를 확실히 듣지 못하셨다니 놀라워요.” 내가 대꾸했다. “저희 집에서도 들렸는데. 저희 집은 여기서 더 멀어요. 게다가 그때 우리집 문은 다 잠겨  있었어요.”\\n\\u3000“젠장, 그걸 왜 이제야 알아챘지!” 그가 말했다. “들어봐라! 이놈의 평지에 혼자 있는 자식에게는 말이다. 그것도 생각이 모자라고 속(위)이 비워 있는 자식, 이 지랄 같은 추위와 추격에 고통 받고 있던 자식의 귀에 밤새 울리는 건 대포소리이고 밤새 들리는 건 그 자식을 추격하는 소리다. 들리느냐? 그 자식 눈에 보이는 건 새빨간 코트를 입고 횃불을 들고서 수색하고 있는 병사들의 둥근 원이다. 그 자식 귀에 들리는 거라곤 누군가가 번호(죄수번호)를 부르는 소리 ‘꼼짝 마라’며 외치는 소리, 머스킷총(19세기에 사용된 서양 옛날 총)들이 덜거덕거리는 소리, 그리고 이렇게 명령하는 소리다. ‘준비 총! 바쳐 총! 저 놈이 꼼짝 못하도록 총을 겨누고 있게 제군들!’ 그리곤 체포되는 거지. 그리곤 없어! 제기랄. 어젯밤에 내가 본 한 무리의 추격대만 하더라도 아예 그냥 땅을 뚫고 순서대로 나오더군. 젠장. 내가 다 세었단 말이야! 정확하게 백 명이었어. 그리고 그 놈의 대포소리는 또 어떻고! 날이 밝은 후에도 이놈의 안개가 그 지랄 같은 대포소리로 진동하는 것을 내가 다 보았단 말이야! 그런데 그 자식 말이다”\\n\\u3000그는 지금까지 내가 거기에 있다는 사실 조차 잊은 듯이 말을 했었다. “그 놈에게서 뭔가 주목할 만한 것은 없더냐?”\\n\\u3000“그의 얼굴에 심한 멍이 있었어요.” 내가 알고 있다는 것을 전혀 모르고 있던 내용까지 기억해내며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“여기 아니더냐?” 그가 손바닥으로 자신의 왼쪽 뺨을 사정없이 후려 갈기며 고함질렀다.\\n“예, 거기였어요!”\\n\\u3000“그가 어디에 있었지?” 그가 조금 남아있던 음식을 자신의 회색 재킷 가슴에 잔득 집어넣으며 말했다. “그가 간 방향을 말해다오. 내가 한 마리 ‘블러드하운드’(사람을 추격할 때 사용하는 후각이 발달한 개) 처럼 녀석을 허물어뜨려버릴 테니까.  그 전에 이 망할 놈의  쇠(다리에 찬 쇠사슬)부터. 쇠 때문에 다리에 상처가 났다! 젠장. 그 줄(쇠사슬 자르는 연장)부터 내게 다오,  꼬마야.”\\n\\u3000나는 안개가 ‘그 다른 남성’에게 ‘수의를 입힌’(감싸 앉았던) 방향을 손가락으로 가리켰다. 그가 잠깐 동안 그쪽 방향을 쳐다보았다. 하지만 그는 잔뜩 우거진 젖은 잔디 위에 주저앉고서는 마치 미친 사람처럼 자신의 쇠(다리에 찬 쇠사슬)를 줄로 갈기 시작했다. 나에게는 관심도 없었다. 오직 자신의 다리에만 온 정신을 집중하고 있었다. 그의 다리는 족쇄(쇠사슬)에 오랫동안 비벼져 피투성이였다. 그는 지금 자신의 다리가 줄보다도 더 감각이 없다는 듯 자신의 다리를 거칠게 다루고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그가 맹렬한 기세로 ‘그 일’(줄로 쇠사슬 자르기)에 몰두하기 시작하자 나는 다시 그가 무서워지기 시작했다. 그것도 충분히 많이 무서웠다. 거기다 나는 지금 집에서 너무 멀리 온 것도 걱정이 되기 시작했다. 내가 그에게 말했다. 이제 가봐야 한다고. 그러나 그에게선 아무런 기척이 없었다. 그래서 나는 지금 내가 할 수 있는 최선의 방책은 여기서 살짝 빠져나가는 것이라는 생각이 들었다. 내가 할 수 있는 한  최대한  빨리 말이다.\\n\\u3000내가 그를 마지막으로 돌아보았을 때도,  그는 자신의 무릎 위로 고  개를 숙인 채  계속해서  족쇄를  갈고(자르고)  있었다.  그 족쇄(다리에 찬 쇠사슬)에 성마른 저주의 말들을 퍼붓는 것을 잊지 않고서 말이다.\\n\\u3000내가 그에게서 나는 소리를 듣기 위해 마지막으로 안개 속에서 멈추    어 섰을 때조차도, 그 줄은 여전히 계속해서 갈리고 있었다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 4장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000나는, 경찰이 부엌에서 나를 기다리고 있다가 나를 체포해갈 거라고 전적으로 예상하고 있었다. 그러나 부엌에는 경찰이 단 한 명도 없었다. 내 강도질(누나가 만든 맛있는 음식들 중 일부를 몰래 빼돌려 탈옥   한 죄수에게 가져다 준 것)이 아직 발각되지 않은 것이다.\\n\\u3000‘조 부인’(주인공의 누나)은 ‘그 날’(크리스마스)의  축제분위기를  내기 위해 집을 단장하느라 유별나게 바빠하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000반면 ‘조’(주인공의 매형)는 부엌문 앞 계단으로 쫓겨나 있었는데 누나의 쓰레받기에서 일단 피하고 보자는 심상인 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000누나가 시설물(집과 대장간) 바닥들을 정력적으로 쓸어 담을 때면 머잖아 쓰레받기 안에 담기는 물건이 조의 정해진 운명이었기 때문이다.  항상 그랬다.\\n\\u3000“그리고 너, 대체 어딜 쏘다니다 오는 거야?” 이것은, 내가 내 양심을 이끌고 모습을 드러냈을 때 ‘조 부인’(누나)이 내게 던진 크리스마스 인사였다.\\n나는 캐럴 들으려 마을 아래쪽에 갔다 왔노라고 말했다.\\n\\u3000“뭐! 괜찮겠지!”라며 조  부인이  자기  의견을  제시했다.  “네 녀석이 더 나쁜 짓을 할 수도 있었을 텐데 말이야.”\\n\\u3000나는 속으로 생각했다. 수상하게 여길 필요도 없이 누나 말이 맞노라고.\\n\\u3000“아마도 내가 대장장이의 아내만 아니었어도, 그리고 똑같은 이야기지만 앞치마를 절대 벗을 수 없는 노예만 아니었어도 말이야, 나도 캐럴을 들으러 갔었어야 하는데.” 조 부인이 계속 말했다. “사실 나는 캐 럴을 몹시 좋아해, 그게 내가 캐럴을 절대로 듣지 않으려는 가장 만족스러운 이유야.”\\n\\u3000쓰레받기가 우리 앞에서 물러났을 때 나를 따라 부엌 안으로 들어가는 모험을 감행한 ‘조’(주인공의 매형)는, ‘조 부인’(주인공의 누나)이 자신에게 가늘고 짧은 눈 화살을 던지자 유화(타협)적인 의미에서 자신의 손등으로 자기 코를 쓰윽 문질렀다.\\n\\u3000일단 ‘조 부인의 그 눈 화살’이 거두어지자, 조는 자신의 두 집게손가락으로 살짝 십자 모양을 만들고는 그걸 내게 내보이는 것이다. 조 부인이 심술을 부릴 때마다 우리들이 주고받는 표식(상징)이었다.\\n\\u3000조 부인이 심술을 부리는 것이 훨씬 더 일상적인 일이었기 때문에,  조와 나는 종종, 아니 수 주 동안이나 계속해서, 두 집게손가락을 십자 모양으로 만들어 보곤 했다. 십자군 전사들이 자신들의 양 다리를 십 자모양으로 만들곤 했었다는 그 기념비적인 표식처럼 말이다.\\n\\u3000우리는 훌륭한 저녁식사를 가질 예정이었다. 식탁에는 “절인 돼지고기의 다리 한 짝, 그리고 푸른 채소들, 속을 꽉 채운 후 불에 구운 ‘사 육조류’(칠면조나 오리 같은 것) 한 쌍”이 오를 예정이었다.\\n\\u3000보기 좋게 만들어진 민스파이(작고 달콤하고 파이) 하나는 어제 아침에 만들어두었었다. 그런 이유 때문에 아직까지 민스미트(파이 안에 들어가는 ‘말린 과일과 양념 덩어리’)가 사라진 게 들통 나지 않았던 것이다. 푸딩은 벌써 팔팔 끓이고 있는 중이었다.\\n\\u3000이러한 광범위한 준비들을 하려다보니 우린 아침식사를 소탈하게(예 절이나 형식에 얽매이지 않고) 해야 했다. “안 되지,” 조 부인이 말했다. “암 안 되고말고, 눈앞에 할 일이 있는데, 예의범절 다 따지며 처 먹고서 흥청망청 떠들고 논 후 설거지까지 할 시간이 어디에 있겠어. 내 장담하고말고!”\\n\\u3000그래서 우리는 우리의  빵조각들을  나누었다.  그건  마치  집에  있는 한 명의 남성과 한 명의 꼬마가 아니라 우리가 마치 강행군을 강요당한 2천 명의 군인들인 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그리고 우리는 사죄하는 얼굴 표정을 지어며 드레서(서양영화에 나오는 목재찬장, 아랫부분은 나무탁자 윗부분은 선반들) 위에 놓여있던 주전자에서 우유와 물을 꿀꺽꿀꺽  삼켰다.\\n\\u3000이럭저럭 하는 동안에, ‘조 부인’(주인공의 누나)은 깨끗한 흰색 커 튼들을 쳤고(걸었고), 헌 것을 걷어내고 ‘커튼 아래 꽃무늬 주름장식’을 ‘폭이 넓은 굴뚝’에 압정으로 고정시켜 가렸고, 약간 보기 흉했던 응접실의 벽지를 확 걷어냈다. 응접실은 복도 맞은편에 있었다.\\n\\u3000응접실의 벽지는 다른 때에는 걷어낸 적이 없었다. 응접실의  벽지는, 은종이를 뒤덮은 ‘서늘한 연무’(실안개)처럼 일 년 내내 그곳에 덮여 있었었다. 어떤 때는 심지어 벽난로 선반 위에 있는 네 마리의 조 그마한 흰색 도자기 ‘푸들’(털이 복슬복슬한 개)들도 이 서늘한 연무 (실안개)에 덮여 있곤 했다. 이 네 마리 푸들들 모두 흰색 코를 가졌고 입에는 꽃이 가득한 바구니를 하나씩 물고 있었다. 각각 서로 마주보고 있었다.\\n\\u3000‘조 부인’은 정말 깨끗한 가정주부였다. 하지만 그녀는, 자신의 청결 함(깨끗함)을 지저분함 그 자체보다도 ‘더 불유쾌하고 더 못마땅하게’ 만드는 정말 정교한 기예(갈고닦은 기술과 재주)를 가지고 있었다.\\n\\u3000청결은 신앙심만큼 중요하다. 그리고 어떤 사람들은 자기 삶에서 중요한 무언가 때문에 ‘조 부인’(주인공의 누나)과 똑같이 행동 하곤 한다.(자기들 이유 때문에 자꾸 남을 괴롭힌다는 의미)\\n\\u3000크리스마스 날 누나는 할 일이 많았다. 바꾸어 말하면 우리(‘조’와 ‘나’)가 누나 대신 교회에 기도드리려갈 예정이었다. 대장장이 복장을 하고서 일을 하고 있는 조(주인공의 매형)의 모습은, 정말이지 다부지고 튼튼한 한 명의 대장장이 그대로였다. 하지만 휴일에는 아무리 좋은 옷을 차려입어도 하나의 허수아비(초라한 사람) 같았다.\\n\\u3000그는 뭘 입어도 꼭 맞는 게 없었고 막상 차려 입은 옷도 자기 옷이 아닌 것만 같았다. 그가 입는 모든 옷들이 그를 못 뜯어 먹어 안달이었다. 당시 축제시즌(크리스마스)이었다. 명량한 종소리가 울리려고 할 때였다. 그가 일요일 참회자의 완벽한 복장으로 차려 입고서 방에서 나왔다. 정말 비참할  지경이었다.\\n\\u3000나로 말하자면 내 자신에 대한 감정은 이랬다. 누나에게 나는 내 생일날 ‘산부인과 의사인 순경’에게 붙잡힌 한 명의 어린 범죄자였다. 내가 그런 식으로 법의 지엄함에 대해 폭행을 가한 것에 합당한 대우를 내가 받아야 한다는 어떤 개념을 누나가 가지고 있었음에 틀림없었다. (주인공을 손바닥으로 자꾸 때리고 못살게 굴었다는 의미) 적어도 내 생각은 그랬다.\\n\\u3000나는 마치 “내가 이성, 종교, 도덕의 명령에 반해서라도 나는 반드시 태어나고 말겠다.”라고 주장하고서 태어난 것처럼, 그리고 내가  마치  “내 가장 친한 친구들의 강력한 만류에도 불구하고 나는 반드시 태어나고 말겠다.”라고 주장하고서 태어난 것처럼 누나에게서 항상 부당한 대우를 받았다.\\n\\u3000심지어 누나가 나에게 새로운 옷을 맞추어 주려고 양복점에 데리고갔을 때조차도, 재봉사에게 내 옷을 소년원복 같이 보이게 만들어 달라는 주문을 했다. 결코 녀석에게 손과 발을 자유로이 사용할 자유를 주지 말라고 주문을  했다.\\n\\u3000그러므로 조(매형)와 내가 교회로 가는 모습은 인정 많은 사람들의  눈엔 감동적인 광경이었음이 틀림없었다. 그러나 내가 우리의 겉모습 때문에 당한 고통은, 내 내면세계가 꺾어야했던 고초에 비하면 아무것도 아니었다.\\n\\u3000‘조 부인’(주인공의 누나)이 식료품저장실 근처를 지나갈 때마다 혹은 누나가 방에서 나갈 때마다 나를 엄습했었던 공포들은, 오직 내가 내 두 손이 저지른 일을 마음속으로 되씹어볼 때면 함께 따라다닌 양심의 가책과만 비교될 수 있는 성격의 것이었다.\\n사악한 비밀의 무게에 짓눌리고 있던 나는 곰곰이 생각했다.\\n\\u3000‘만약 내가 교회에 내 사악한 비밀을 알린다면 그 끔찍한 젊은 남성의 앙갚음으로부터 교회가 나를 보호해줄 만큼 교회가 충분히 망강해질 수 있을지 없을지를’\\n\\u3000나는 마음속에 이런 생각까지 품게 되었다. 결혼예고를 알리는 종이가 읽혀지고 목사님께서 “그대들은 그것을(결혼) 지금  선언하시오!”라고 말씀하실 그때가 바로, 내가 일어나서 ‘교회 제의실 안에서 개인면  담을 신청한다.’고 말씀드릴 바로 그때일 거라는 생각까지 품게 되었다.\\n\\u3000만약 그 날이 크리스마스가 아니고 일요일만 아니었어도, 나는 그런 극단적인 수단을 강구해(실행해) 여기에 모인 소규모 신자들을 경악하게  만들었을지도 모른다.\\n\\u3000(여기서 잠깐 : 소설에 나오는 이름이 많음. 그때그때 설명하겠음. 부담가지시지 말고 그냥 넘기면 됨. 모두 중요한 배우들 아님. 남녀주연급 배우들은 아직 나오지도 않았음)\\n\\u3000교회서기인 ‘웝슬 씨’(소설 후반부에 다시 나오는 이름임. 수첩에 적어두면 나중에 혼란스럽지 않음, 주인공의 주의를 환기시키는 역할임)가 우리와 함께 식사를 할 예정이었다. 그리고 바퀴 제조인인 ‘허블 씨’(엑스트라)와 ‘허블 씨 부인’(엑스트라)도 우리와 함께 식사를 할 예정이었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 ‘펌블추크 삼촌’(남자조연임, 그래도 이름 외워두어야 함, 나 중에 주인공의 성공과 파멸을 싸잡아 비난하는 역할임, 뚱뚱하고 능청 맞은 기회주의자 역할임)이 자신의 ‘2륜 경마차’(바퀴  두 개)를 끌고 우리 집으로 식사를 하러 올 예정이었다. 펌블추크 삼촌은 우리 마을 과 가장 가까운 마을에서 잡곡상(쌀 이외의 곡식을 사고파는 상인) 일 을 하는 부유한 상인이었다. 원래는 조(주인공의 매형)의 삼촌인데 ‘조 부인’(주인공의 누나)이 부당하게도 자신의 삼촌으로 삼아버린 경우다. 점심시간은 1시 30분에 있을 예정이었다. 조와 내가 집에 도착했을 땐  이미  식탁이  놓여  있었다.  조  부인은  깔끔하게  옷을  입고 있었고\\n식사도  차려져 있었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 정문도 열려있었다. 정문은 절대 그  외의  날에는  열어두는 법이 없었다. 회사(대장간)로 갈 때는 옆문을 사용했다.\\n\\u3000어쨌든 모든 것이 훌륭했다. 그리고 아직은 “강도니! 약탈이니!” 하     는 말들이 한 마디도 들려오지 않고 있었다.\\n\\u3000시간이 되자 손님들이 도착했다. 그렇다고 내 감정들에 어떤 구원이 찾아온  건 아니었다.\\n\\u3000웝슬 씨(교회서기)는 ‘로마인 같은 코’(매부리코)와 앞이마가 번쩍번쩍 빛나는 대머리였다. 그는 깊은 목소리를 가지고 있었는데 그 자신도 그것에 비상한 자긍심을 지니고 있었다.\\n\\u3000실제로도 그를 아는 지인들 사이에선 “만약 그(웝슬 씨)에게 맡긴다면 그가 목사님보다 더 설교를 잘 할 수 있다”라고 받아들여지고 있었다. 사실 그 자신도 “만약 교회가 개방되어 있고 경쟁이 가능했다면”  그가 교회에서 이름을 날리는 게 가망 없는 얘기가 아니었을 거라고 인정했다.\\n\\u3000“교회가 개방되어 있지 않은 관계로”, 내가 앞서 말했듯이 그(웝슬 씨)는 아직 우리의 서기였다. 하지만 그는 “아멘”이란 소리를 내지르며 사람들을 소름끼칠 정도로까지 혼내줄 수 있었다. 그리고 시편을 낭송할 때면 그는 일단 좌중을 한 바퀴 쭉 돌아본 후 마치 다음과 같이 말 하려는 듯 시편을 낭송하곤  했다.\\n\\u3000“여러분들은 방금 제 친구의  낭송을  들으셨습니다.  그렇다면  이제 제 스타일에 대한 여러분의 고견도 한 번씩 말씀해주십시오!”\\n물론 그러고는 그는 항상 전체 구절을 다 낭송했다.\\n\\u3000손님들이 도착할 때마다 내가 직접 문을 열어주었는데, 손님들에게  문을 열어주는 것이 우리의 일상(습관)인 것처럼 보이기 위해서였다.\\n\\u3000첫 번째로  웝슬 씨(교회서기)에게 문을 열어주었다.  두 번째로 허블  씨 부부(바퀴제조인)에게 문을 열어주었다. 그리고 우리의 마지막 손님인 펌블추크 삼촌(잡곡상인)에게도 문을 열어주었다. 주의 : 나는 아직 그를 삼촌이라고 부르는 것이 허락되지 않았다. 내가 그를 삼촌이라고 부를 경우 가장 가혹한 형벌이 내게 주어질 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“조 부인(주인공의  누나)” 펌블추크 삼촌이 한 마리 물고기 같은 입을 움직여가면서 말했다. 그는 몸집이 크고 호흡이 아주 가쁜 중년의 남성으로 행동이 느렸다. 침침한 눈으로 뭔가를 응시하는 그의 두 눈도 잊지 말아야한다. 머리 위에는 모래 빛 머리카락이 곧추 서 있었다. 그래서 그는 마치 막 숨 막혀 죽기 일보 직전에서 막 나온 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000어쨌든 펌블추크 삼촌이 한 마리 물고기 같은 입을 움직여가며 조 부인에게 이렇게 말하기  시작했다.\\n\\u3000“계절 인사(크리스마스 선물)로 이걸 가져 왔지요~, 제가 가져 왔지요~, 엄마, 셰리 와인(포도주, 식사 전 마심, 식욕촉진) 한 병을요, (능글능글) 그리고 무엇을 또 가져왔게요?, 엄마. 짠, 포트와인(단맛이 나는 포도주) 한 병도 이렇게 가지고 왔지요~ (능글능글)”\\n\\u3000그(펌블추크 삼촌)는 매년 크리스마스마다 자신이 완전히  새로  이 집을 방문하는 사람인 것처럼 나타났다. 물론 매년 인사말도 똑 같았다. 어쨌든 그가 아령(운동기구) 같이 생긴 병 두 개를 가지고 나타났다.\\n\\u3000그가 우리 집을 방문해 거창한 인사말을 건넬 때면, 조 부인(주인공의 누나)도 지금 이런 식으로 답하곤 했다. “오~, 펌~블~추크~ 사~ 암촌! 어머, 이렇게 친절하실 수가~!” (-_-;;)\\n\\u3000그러면 그(펌블추크 삼촌)도 역시 지금 이런 식으로 매번 응수하는 것이다. “그게 다 부인의 공이죠! 부인,  가족들은  모두  원기왕성한가 요? 가만 보자 그 ‘쓰고 남은 6천원’ 같은 녀석은 잘 지내는지요?, 부인.”\\n‘쓰고 남은 돈 6천원’은 나(주인공)를 의미한다.\\n(19세기 영국 돈 ‘6페니’가 현재 우리나라 물가 기준으로 ‘6천원’임)  이 날 우리는 부엌에서 정찬(정해진 차례에 따라서 먹는 점심)을 먹\\n었다. 잠시 쉰 후, 응접실에서 “견과류들(땅콩), 오렌지들, 사과들”을 먹었다. 응접실은 “조(매형)가 작업복을 일요일 예배 복으로 바꿔 입는 것처럼”  바뀌어져 있었다.\\n\\u3000누나는 지금 유달리 활기를 띄고 있었다. 누나는 확실히 다른 사람 들보다 ‘허블 씨 부인’ 앞에서 대체로 더 상냥했다.\\n\\u3000내가 기억하는 허블 씨 부인은 키가 작고 머리칼이 곱슬곱슬한 신랄 한(날카로운) 사람이었다. 그날 그녀는 하늘 색 옷을 입고 있었다. 그녀는 인습(관례)적으로 소녀 같은 태도를 견지하고 있었는데 이는 그녀가 허블 씨(바퀴제조인)와 결혼했기 때문이다. 오래전 일은 기억나지 않지만, 그녀가 그와 결혼할 때 그녀가 훨씬 더 어렸었다.\\n\\u3000내가 기억하고 있는 허블 씨는 터프하고 어깨높이가 상당히 높으며  몸이 앞으로 굽은 나이 많은 분이었다. 바퀴제조인이라는 직업상 그에 게선 늘 톱밥 향기가 났다. 그의 양 다리는 비정상적일만큼 넓게 벌어져 있었다.(‘O’자 다리) 그래서 어린 시절 내가 좁은 길을 올라오고 있는 그를 만날 때면, 나는 항상 그의 양 다리 사이로 ‘수 킬로미터나 되는 탁 터인 시골’을 바라볼 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000이러한 훌륭한 일행들 틈에서 나는 본의 아니게도 괴로운 입장에 놓 여있어야 했다. 심지어 내가 식품저장실에서 도둑질을 하지 않았다고 하더라도 나는 이들 틈에서 불편함을 느끼고 있었을 것이다.\\n\\u3000그것은 단지, 내가 테이블보(덮는 천)의 날카로운 끝에 간신히 끼어져 있었기 때문이 아니었다. 식탁이 내 가슴까지 올라와서도 아니었으며, ‘펌블추크’(주인공의 삼촌)라는 사람의 팔꿈치가 내 눈에 닿아서도 아니었다. 그리고 이들 사이에서 내 발언이 허용되지 않았기 때문도 아니었다. 사실 난 지금 아무런 말도 하고 싶지 않았다.\\n\\u3000또한 이들이 나에게 가금류(칠면조)들의 다리 끝 그것도 물때가 그대로 끼어 있는 다리 끝부분을 할당해주었기 때문도 아니었다. 그리고 도대체 이게 어느 부위인지도 애매모호한 돼지고기 어느 부위를 내 몫으로 할당받았기 때문도 아니었다. 그리고 그 부위가 그 돼지가 살아있을 때 가장 허영심을 내보이지 못했을 부위를 내 몫으로 할당받았기 때문도 아니었다.\\n\\u3000그렇다 ; 만약 그들이 나를 좀 가만히 내버려두었다면 나는 그런 것 들(주인공에게 배당된 소홀한 음식들)에 신경 쓰고 앉아 있지도 않았을 것이었다.\\n하지만 그들은 끝까지 나를 가만히 내버려 두지 않았다.\\n\\u3000그들은 이렇게 생각하는 것 같았다. 그들이 자신들의 대화주제 방향을 가끔씩이라도 내게 겨누는 것에 실패하고 그 화살 끝으로 나를 쿡쿡 찔러보는 것에 실패한다면, 그것은 호기를 놓치는 것이라고 그들은 생각하는  듯 했다.\\n\\u3000그들에게 나는 마치 스페인 원형 경기장 안에 놓인 불운하고 작은 황소이었을지도  모른다.  나는  도덕적으로는  옳지만  내  마음에는 아픈 그들의 작대기들로 아프게 쓰리게 만져져야하는 존재였을지도 모른다. ‘그들이  나를  못살게  구는  것’은  우리가  정찬(점심)을  위해 자리에\\n앉는 순간부터 시작되었다. 먼저 웝슬 씨가 연극공연 같은 극적 효과를  노리고  은혜로운  말씀을  시작하셨는데,  지금  생각하기로는, 「 햄\\n릿」(비극)과 「리처드 3세」(희극, 코미디)에 나오는 대사들을 종교적 으로 크로스(교차)시킨 것이 아니었나 싶다. 어쨌든 그는 우리가 진정으로 감사해야한다는 아주 합당하고 강렬한 열망을 담아서 이야기를 끝마쳤다.\\n\\u3000(고상한 셰익스피어의 작품 속 대사들을 서투르게 인용했는데 당시 그 자리에 있던 사람들의 교양이 낮아서 웝슬 씨의 대사가 사실인지 거짓인지 몰랐다는 얘기. 웝슬 씨는 소설 중-후반부에 실제로 연극배우가 됨. 런던으로 가서 전혀 안 유명한 연극배우가 됨.^^ 연극하는 도중에 관객석에서 항의의 표시로 물건들이 마구 날아오는 그런 배우가 돼서 주인공을 놀라게  함.)\\n\\u3000그러자마자 누나가 내게로 눈을 고정시킨 채 이렇게 말했다. “저 말    씀 들었지? 은예를 알아라.” 누나의 목소리는 낮고 나무라는 투였다.\\n\\u3000“각별히,” 펌블추크 씨가 또 끼어들었다. “은혜를  알거라,  꼬마야, 너를 손수 양육해준  분들에게.”\\n\\u3000허블 씨 부인이 고개를 흔들더니, 마치 내 인생이 좋지 않게 결말이 날 거라는 것을 예감한다는 듯이 구슬픈 눈으로 나를 쳐다보며 말했다. “왜 저 청년(주인공, 꼬마임)은 단 한 번이라도 감사해하지를 앉죠?”\\n\\u3000이 도덕적인 미스터리는 우리 일행에게 과도하게 어려운 문제였다.  허블 씨가 이렇게 말함으로써 그 수수께끼는 간단명료하게 풀렸다. “천성적으로  악한 것이지요.”\\n\\u3000그러자 모두들 “그 말이 옳다!”며 중얼거렸다. 그러더니 나를 대단히 불유쾌하고 인신공격적인 태도로 빤히 쳐다보았다.\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형)의 지위와 영향력은 아무도 없을 때보다 지금처럼 일행이 있을 때 더 미미했다. 미미할 게 더 있다면 말이다. 하지만 그는 항상 나의 든든한 조력자였고 가능한 한 나에게 위안을 주려고 애썼다. 물론 그 자신의 방식대로 말이다.\\n\\u3000그리고 식사자리에서도 조는 그레이비(고기국물에 밀가루 넣고 만든 소스)가 조금이라도 남아 있는 날이면, 내 접시에 항상  그레이비를 듬뿍 담아주곤 했다. 오늘은 그레이비가 아주 많았다. 사람들이 나의 본성을 의심하는 이때에 조가 또다시 내 접시에 그레이비를 한 가득 담아주었다. 대략 250밀리리터(우유1팩)쯤 되는 양이었던 것 같다.\\n\\u3000식사가 좀 더 진행되었을 때, 웝슬 씨(교회서기)가 그날 아침에 있었던 목사님의 설교를 맹렬하게 비평하기 시작했다. 그리고 그는, 만약 자신이 설교를 했더라면 어떤 종류의 설교를 했을 것인지를 넌지시 암시했다. 물론 그가 늘 하는 이 말도 잊지 않았다. “교회가 개방되어 있 었더라면”이라는  가정 말이다.\\n\\u3000자기가 펼칠 예정이라는 언설(말)의 몇몇 요지들을 우리에게 들려줌으로써 모두의 비위를 맞추어준 후, 웝슬 씨(교회서기)가 그 날의 설교 주제는 잘못 선정되었다는 사견(생각)을 피력했다.(말했다) 그가 또 덧 붙이기를 “특히나 요즘 같이 다룰 만한 주제가 많은 때에 그것은 더 변명의 여지가 없는 것입니다”라는 것이다.\\n\\u3000 “옳고말고요.”라며 펌블추크 삼촌(잡곡상)이 말했다. “핵심을  찌르시는 말씀이십니다, 선생! 그것들(설교주제)의 뒷면에 소금을 치는 방법을 알고 있는 사람에게는 설교 주제가 사방에 널려 있습니다. 만약 소금상자만 준비되어 있다면 주제를 찾기 위해 멀리 갈 필요도 없지요.” 사람들의 반응을 잠시 살핀 후 펌블추크 씨가 계속 덧붙였다. “이 돼지고기만 봐도 알 수 있습니다. 여기에 주제가 있지 않습니까! 만약 주 제를 원하신다면 자 이 돼지고기를 보십시오!”\\n\\u3000“옳으신 말씀이십니다, 선생. 사실 어린 것들이 성서의 말씀에서 추 론해 볼 수 있는 교훈들이 많이 있지요.” 윕슬 씨(교회서기)가 말했다. 나는  웝슬  씨가  말을  하기  전부터  그가  나를  이쯤에서 걸고넘어질\\n것임을 이미 알고  있었다.\\n“너, 잘 들어둬.” 누나가 심각한 표정을 지어며 한 마디 껴들었다. 조(주인공의  매형)가  내  접시에  그레이비(고기국물에  밀가루를 넣고\\n만든 소스)를 조금 더  담아주었다.\\n(영어단어  ‘돼지’에는  ‘골칫거리  인간새끼’라는  의미가  있음) “돼지는,” 웝슬 씨가 ‘자기 포크’로 당황하고 수치스러워 얼굴이 새\\n빨개진 ‘나’를 겨누며 말을 이어갔다. 그가 말하는 돼지가 꼭 내 세례  명을 의미하는 것 같았다. “돼지는 낭비를 일삼는 녀석입니다. 그 돼지의 폭식이 지금 우리 앞에 놓여있지 않습니까. 이것(식탁 위에 놓인 돼 지)이야말로 어린 것에겐 좋은 본보기입니다.” 나는 이것이 그에게 꽤나 잘 어울린다는 생각이 들었다.  좀 전까지만  해도 돼지고기  살이  아 주 포동포동하고 육즙이 많다고 칭찬하고 있었기 때문이다.  그(웝슬 씨)가 계속 말했다. “돼지에게 있어 혐오스러운 것은 소년에게 있어 더 더욱 혐오스럽습니다.”\\n소녀도요”라며 허블 씨(바퀴제조인)가  제시했다.\\n\\u3000“당연하지요, 소녀의 경우에도 마찬가지입니다, 친애하는 허블 씨”라며 웝슬 씨가 찬성을 표시한 후 다소 안달이 난 표정으로 이렇게 덧붙였다. “하지만 지금 여기엔 소녀가 없지요.”라고.\\n\\u3000“게다가” 펌블추크 씨가 나에게로 몸을 획 돌리면서 말을 했다. “네가 무엇에 감사해야하는 지를 생각해 보거라. 만약 네가 끽끽 소리를 내는  것으로 태어났었더라면―”\\n\\u3000“만약  어린아이가 한번이라도  끽끽 소리를 내는 것이 될 수 있다면   저 녀석이 그랬어요.” 내 누나가 매우 강조하는 말투로 말했다.\\n\\u3000조가 내 접시에 그레이비(고기국물에 밀가루를 넣고  만든  소스)를 조금  더 담아주었다.\\n\\u3000“글쎄요, 하지만 난 네 발 달린 끽끽이(돼지새끼, 주인공)를 의미했 는데요.”라며 펌블추크 씨가 말했다. “잘 생각해봐라. 만약 네(주인공) 가 그런 것들로 태어났다면 넌 지금쯤 여기서 무엇이 되어 있겠니?

아니, 그렇지 못했을 겁니다. 그랬다면 너(주인공, 꼬마임)의 운명이 어떻게 되었을 것 같으냐?” 펌블 추크 씨가 다시 한 번 내게로 몸을 돌리며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그랬다면 넌(주인공) 시장가격에 따라 네 몸값을 더 쳐주겠다는 사 람들을 위해 도살당했을  것이다.  푸줏간집  주인인  ‘던스터블’(독자가 알 필요 없는 이름임)이 네 녀석을 끌어다 짚 속에 처넣었을 것이다. 그리고 네 녀석의 왼쪽 팔에 호된 매질을 가한 후 네 녀석의 오른 팔에도 똑 같이 호된 매질을 가했을 것이다. 그리곤 그가 이제 작업복을 걷어 올리며 조끼 호주머니에서 펜나이프(작은 칼)를 꺼내들었을 것이며 그랬다면 네 놈의 피는 낭자해 그것으로 네 목숨도 끝이 났을 것이다.  그  다음에는  아무도 네  놈을 손수  길러줄  수  없어. 원,  천만에 말씀이지!”\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형)가  나에게 그레이비(고기국물에 밀가루를 넣고 만든 소스)를 더 주려고 했다. 난 그러기가 두려웠다.(거부했다)\\n\\u3000“저 애는 당신에게 큰 골칫거리에요, 부인.” 허블 씨 부인(신랄한 여자)이 내 누나에게 동정의 눈빛을 가득 담아 보내며 말을 했다.\\n\\u3000“골치라고요?” 누나가 메아리까지 넣어가며 말했다.  “불안이라고 요?” 그러더니 누나는 끔찍한 카탈로그(책) 한 권을 널어놓기 시작했다. 누나는 먼저 내가 지금까지 걸렸었던 모든 질병들의 이름을 언급 했다. 누나는  또 나 때문에 잠  못 잔 수많았던 불면의  밤들을 얘기했  고, 내가 뒹굴다 떨어졌었던 높은 곳들과 내가 뒹굴다 처박혔었던 낮은 곳들을 죄다 얘기했으며, 내(주인공)가 놀다가 입었던 수많은 상처 들과, 무엇보다 내가(주인공) 무덤 속으로 들어가 주었으면 하고 바랐던 모든 시간들을 언급했고 그녀(주인공의 누나)의 그런 소망에도 불구하고 내가 그(무덤) 속으로 들어가기를 반항적으로 거부하더라는 얘 기까지  죄다 털어놓았다.\\n\\u3000나는 이렇게 생각한다. ‘로마인들이 자신들의 코(매부리코)를 주제로 서로가 서로를 아주 짜증나게 만들었음이 틀림없으며, 아마도 그것이 결국 로마인들로 하여금 역사가 판명하듯 한시도 가만히 있지 못하는 침략적인 민족으로 만들었을  것이다.’라고.\\n\\u3000어쨌든, 내 경범죄(가벼운 범죄)들에 대한 누나의 그 장황한 설명이 이어지는 동안, 웝슬 씨(교회서기)의 매부리코가 나를  아주 짜증나게 하고 있었다.  나는 그가 아주 소리를  길게 내지를 때까지 그  코를 잡   아  땅기고 싶었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이렇게 내가 참고 견디었던 모든 것들은, 잇따라 이어지든 누나의 그 장황한 설명이 잠시 멈춘 사이 나를 휘감았던 무시무시한 감정들에 비하면 아무것도  아니었다.\\n\\u3000누나가 발언을 멈추자 그 자리에 있던 모든 사람들이 분개하는 눈빛으로 증오하는 눈빛으로 나를 쳐다보았다. 그들의 분개와 증오는 나를 고통스럽게 했다.\\n\\u3000그럼에도 불구하고,” 펌블추크 씨가 대화의 주제를 원래 있던 곳으로 완만하게 되돌리며 이렇게 말했다. “담즙인 것 같지만, 돼지고기 역시 아주 많아. 그렇지않아?”\\n\\u3000“브랜디 좀 드세요, 삼촌.” 내 누나가 말했다. (브랜디는 ‘포도주를 증류한 술’)\\n\\u3000브랜디? 오 마이 갓(*_*), 기어이 올 것이 오고야 말았다! 이제 그 (펌블추크 삼촌)가 브랜디 맛이 밍밍하다(싱겁다)는 것을 알아차릴 것 이다. 그럼 그는 “브랜디 맛이 왜 이렇게 밍밍해!”라고 말할 것이고 그 렇게 되면 나(주인공)는  끝장이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 식탁보 아래에 있는 식탁 다리를 두 손으로 꽉 붙잡은 후 다가오고 있는 내 죽음(운명)을  기다렸다.\\n\\u3000누나가 ‘돌로 만든 술병’(도자기 같이 안이 전혀 안 보이는 술병, 화 장품 병같이 생긴 것)을 가지러 갔다. 누나가 돌로 만든 술병을 가지고 돌아와 펌블추크 삼촌의 브랜디 잔 안에 퍼부었다. 그 밖에 다른 사람들의 잔에는 아직 술이 따라지지 않았다.\\n\\u3000아, 그 불행한 남성(펌블추크 삼촌)은 자신의 잔을 우습게 쓱 쳐다보고는 잔을 집어 들어 불빛에 비추어보고는 내려놓았다. 그의 그런 행 동들은 내 고통을  연장시켰다.\\n\\u3000이러는 동안 ‘조 부인과 조’(주인공의 누나와 매형)는 식탁을 기운차게 치운 후, 파이와 푸딩을 내놓고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그(펌블추크 삼촌)에게서 눈을 땔 수가 없었다. 나는 계속해서    내 두 손과 두 발로 식탁다리를  단단히 붙잡고 있었다. 나는  그 불쌍한 사람(펌블추크 삼촌)이 손가락으로 자기 잔을 쾌활하게 만지는 것을 지켜보았고, 그가 자기 잔을 들어 올린 후 쓱 한 번 미소를 지어보이더니 고개를 뒤로 확 젖인 후 브랜디를 모두 마셔버리는 것까지 다 지켜보았다.\\n\\u3000그 즉시, 우리 일행은 이루 말로 표현할 수 없는 놀라움에 휘감겼다. 그(펌블추크 삼촌)가 오싹하고 돌발적인 백일해성(경련성 기침 발작) 기침을 되풀이하면서 팔짝팔짝 뛰며 몇 번이고 돌더니 문 쪽으로 달려 나갔기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그때 창문 너머로 그의 모습이 보였다. 그는 격렬하게 거꾸러지며 기침을 내뱉고 있었다. 이 세상에서 가장 끔찍한 얼굴표정이었다. 그가 정신을  잃었음이 명백했다.\\n\\u3000‘조 부인과 조’가 그(펌블추크 삼촌)에게로 달려갔을 때, 나는 탁자 다리를 있는 힘껏 끌어당겼다. 내가 도대체 무엇을 어떻게 잘못했기에 일이 이렇게 된 건지는 모르겠지만, 아무튼 내가 그를 살해했다는 것에는 의심의 여지가  없어보였다.\\n\\u3000사람들이 그를 다시 데려왔을 때, 이 끔찍한 상황 속에서도 나는 일단 안심할 수 있었다. 우리들이 그(펌블추크 삼촌)와 사이가 안 좋았었 다는 양, 그가 우리 일행을 쭉 한 번 살펴본 후 자기 자리에 맥없이 주저앉았다. 그가 헐떡거리며 의미심장하고 짧은 한 마디를 내뱉었다.\\n\\u3000“타르!”라고. (타르는 “석유를 증류할 때 생기는 검은 액체.” 발암물질. 도로 아스팔트 냄새가 타르 냄새임)\\n\\u3000내(주인공, 아직은 꼬마)가 주전자에 담긴 타르 수용액을 술병에다 집어넣었던 것이다. 나는 머지않아 그(삼촌)의 몸 상태가 더 나빠질 것 임을 예감했다. 순간 눈에 보이지 않는 어떤 힘에 이끌려 나는 식탁을 움직였고 곧 그것을 다시 붙잡았다. 마치 현대(19세기 영국)의 영매(무당) 같았다.\\n\\u3000“타르(석유를 증류할 때 생기는 검은 액체, 아스팔트 냄새가 남)라고요!” 내 누나가 경악하며 소리쳤다. “어떻게요? 도대체 어떻게 타르가 어떻게 거기(술병)에 들어갈 수가  있었죠?”\\n\\u3000누나의 그런 말은 소용이 없었다. 부엌에 있던 펌블추크 삼촌은 전 지전능한 존재가 되어서는 고압적으로 손을 내저으며 누나의 말을 자른 후 ‘뜨거운 진(독한 술)과 물’부터 찾았다. 그는 누나가 하는 말의 주어도 듣지 않으려  했다.\\n\\u3000놀랄 만큼이나 깊은 생각(어떻게 타르가 술병에 들어갔지?)에 잠겨 있었던 누나는 바삐 움직이며 “진(독한 술)과, 뜨거운 물, 설탕, 그리고 레몬껍질”을 찾아내  섞어야했다.\\n\\u3000나는 여전히 식탁 다리를 붙잡고 있었다. 당분간은 나도 살았다(위기를 모면했다). 그러자 너무 감사한 나머지 열정에 겨워 식탁 다리를 와락 움켜잡았다.\\n\\u3000점차 나는 안정을  되찾았다. 식탁다리에서 손을 풀고 나도 푸딩 먹는 것에 동참할 수 있었다. 펌블추크 삼촌도 자신에게 할당된 푸딩을 먹었다. 우리 모두 푸딩을 다함께 먹었다. 푸딩  먹기가  끝났다.  진과 물의 기분 좋은 영향 때문에 취기가 오른 펌블추크 삼촌이 활짝 웃기 시작했다.\\n누나가  조(주인공의  매형)에게  “깨끗한  접시들로요,  ―  차가운 걸로요.”라고 말했을 때, 나는 그날 당일을 극복해야한다는 생각을 하기 시 작했다.\\n\\u3000그 순간 나는 또 다시  식탁 다리를 움켜쥐었다. 그리고  나는 그 식탁 다리가 마치 내 어린 시절의  동반자이고 내 영혼의 친구인  양, 나는 그 식탁 다리를 내 가슴에 바짝 밀착시켰다.\\n\\u3000나는 다가오고 있는 일(음식도둑질이 발각되어 체포)을 예견했다. 그리고 이번 경우엔 나도 정말이지 사라지고 없으리라는 것을 감지하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“꼭 맛보셔야 해요.” 누나가 최고로  우아하게  손님들에게  말했다.  “꼭 맛보셔야 해요, 마지막 한 방울까지 다요. 정말 기분 좋고 맛있는 선물(‘셰리 와인’과 ‘포트와인’)이지 뭐예요. 펌블추크 삼촌이 가져오셨 대요.”\\n\\u3000그 자리에 있던 사람들이 모두 뭐라고 중얼중얼 거리며 칭찬의 말을 널려놓았다. 자신이 동료들로부터 우대를 받아 마땅하다는 평소 지견 대로 펌블추크 삼촌이, 모든 것을 자신이 다 고려해보았다는 표정을 지어며 아주 원기 왕성하게 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그럼, 조 부인, 자 우선 최선을 다해 더 먹어봅시다. 그 조그만 파 이(돼지고기 파이) 한 조각부터  시작할까요.”\\n\\u3000누나가 파이를 가지러 나갔다. 나는 식료품저장실로 향하는 그녀의 발자국 소리를 들었다. 나는 펌블추크 삼촌이 자신의 나이프(식칼)를 반듯이 놓는 것을 보았다. 나는 웝슬(교회서기) 씨 매부리코의 콧구멍 속에서 식욕이 다시 되살아나고 있는 모습을 보았다. 나는 허블 씨(바 퀴제조인)가 이렇게 논하는 것도 들었다. “아무리 배가 불러도 돼지고기 파이 한 조각 정도는 더 먹어줄 수 있죠. 맛도 있고 좀 더 먹는다고  해롭지도 않죠.”\\n\\u3000나는 조(주인공의 매형)가 이렇게 말하는 것도  들었다. “핍, 너도 조금 먹게 될 거야.”\\n\\u3000나는 전적으로 확신할 수 없었다. (음식도둑질이 발각될 거라는) 공 포에 질린 내가  마음  속으로만  날카로운  외침을  내질렀는지,  아니면 그 자리에 모여 있던 일행들이 모두 들을 수 있게 내 몸 전체를 통해 고함을 질렀는지 나는 전적으로 확신할 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000나는 내가 더 이상 이 자리를 견딜 수 없을 것임을 감지했다. 지금 당장 달아나야 한다는 생각이 들었다. 나는 식탁 다리에서 손을 떼고 내 일생일대의 탈출을  감행했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 나는 우리 집 대문에서 한 치도  더 나아갈  수 없었다. 왜냐하면 내가 뛰어간 그곳(대문)에서, 내가 그만 머스킷총(노끈에 불을 붙여 화약  발사)을 들고 있던 한 무리의 병사들 속으로 거꾸로 들이받았기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그들 중 한 명이 내게 수갑 한 개를 내밀어 보이며 이렇게 말하고 있었다. “이놈 여기 있었구나, (다른 병사들을 보며) 서둘러라 어서!” 라고.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한유산\\n 5장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000둘러맨 머스킷총(화승총)에서 철커덕거리는 소리를 내며 병사들이 세로로 줄을 지어 우리 집 문 앞에 등장했다. 저녁 파티가 혼란스러워져 우리는 식탁에서 일어나야했다. 조 부인(주인공의 누나)이 빈손으로 돌아오다 멈추곤 빤히 쳐다봤다. 기이하다는 듯 애통해했다. “어머나 세상에 이게 무슨 일이람, 없어진 게, 그래 파이야!”\\n\\u3000조 부인이 빤히 쳐다보고 있을 때, 난(주인공) 상사(하사관)와 부엌에 있었다. 이 중차대한 국면에서도 난 부분적으로나마 내 감각들을 회복했다. 나에게 말을 걸었던 그 상사는 오른 손에 쥔 많은 수갑들을 매력적으로 내밀며 사람들을 둘러보고 있었다. 그의  왼손은  내  어깨 위에 있었다.\\n\\u3000“실례합니다. 신사 숙녀 여러분들.” 상사가 말했다. “이 어린놈(주인공 꼬마)에게는 문에서 이미 얘기했듯이,” (도대체 그 어린놈이 누구겠는가? ←이 문장은 원문에 있는 문장임. 디킨스가 쓴 문장임)  “지금  저는  왕명을  받들어 추적중입니다. 그래서 대장장이가  필요합니다.”\\n\\u3000“당신이 그에게서 원하려는 게 뭐죠?” 누나가 재빨리 쏘아붙이며 말했다. 무엇보다 상사가 대장장이를 찾는다는 말에 분개한 듯했다.\\n\\u3000“부인,” 상사가 정중하게(여성에게 점잖게) 얘기했다. “원래대로라면 저는 이렇게 말씀드려야했겠지요. ‘그의 아내를 만나 영광이고 기쁨이라’고요. 하지만 국왕폐하를 대신해 말씀드리자면 ‘일이 좀 생겼습니다.’입니다.”\\n\\u3000그의 대답은 상사(상급 부사관)로서는 꽤 솜씨 있는 것이어서 우리의 펌블추크 씨가 이렇게 외쳤을 정도였다. “좋은 답변이십니다!” (이 당시 영국 병사들의 저급함과 악행은 유명함. 영국장군이 휴식을 취하고 있는 자기 병사들을 가리켜 “인간○○○들을 모아놓았다”라고 말했을 정도라고 함. 어느 책에서 봤음.)\\n\\u3000“당신이? 대장장이요.” 이때쯤엔 벌써 상사가 조(주인공의 매형)를 알아보고 이렇게 말했을 정도다. “이 수갑들이 말썽을 좀 부리지 뭡니까. 자물쇠의 한쪽이 잘못되었더군요. 결합이 시원치 않아요. 즉시 수리 받고 싶은데, 어떻게 한 번 봐주시겠습니까?”\\n\\u3000조가 눈으로 수갑들을 훑어보더니 의견을 내놓았다. 그걸 수리하기 위해서는 화덕에 불을 다시 지펴야하고 그럼 한 시간보다는 두 시간에    더 가깝게 걸릴 거라고  말했다.\\n\\u3000“그래요? 그렇다면 한 번 착수(시작)해 주시겠습니까,  대장장이 양 반?” 상사가 즉석에서 대답했다. “공무(국가의 일)니까요. 제 부하들이 일손을 좀 거둔다면 도움이  되시겠죠?”\\n\\u3000그 말과 함께, 그(상사)가 자기 부하들을  불렀다.  병사들이 잇따라 부엌 안으로 떼를 지어 들어왔다. 병사들은 자신들의 무기들을 한쪽 구석에 차곡차곡 쌓아놓았다. 그런 다음 그들은 정말로 병사들이 그러 하듯이 그렇게 사방에 쭉 둘러섰다. 그들은 어떨 때는 양 손을 움켜쥐 고는 앞으로 내놓기도 하고, 또 어떨 때는 한 쪽 무릎이나 한 쪽 어깨를 풀기도(휴식) 하고, 또 어떨 때는 혁대나 주머니를 느슨하게 풀기도 하고, 또 어떨 때는 문을 열고서 자신들의 높은 칼라(윗옷) 위로 목을 빳빳하게 내민 채 마당을 향해 침을 뱉기도 했다.\\n\\u3000병사들의 그런 껄렁껄렁한 행동들을 나는 그들이 눈치 못 채게 다 보았다. 왜냐하면 난 다른 불안함(음식도둑질)으로 이미 몸부림 치고 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그러나 그 수갑들이 나를 붙잡기 위한 것이 아니라는 것을 인지하기 시작했고, 어찌되었건 군인들이 파이보다는 더 관심을 끌었기 때문에 없어진 파이는 잠시 잊을 수 있었다. 그제야 난 산산이 조각나 있었던    내 지혜의 파편들을 하나 둘씩 거둬들일 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“제게 시간을 말씀해주실 수 있으신지요?” 상사(상급 부사관)가  자 신의 말에 대꾸했던 펌블추크 씨(잡곡상)에게 말했다. 아마도 아까 자 신의 말을 알아들은 것을 보고 이 남성이 자신에게 시간도 알려줄 수   있는 남성이라고 추측한 것 같다.\\n“딱 2시하고도 30분이  지났습니다.”\\n\\u3000“나쁘지 않은데요.”라고 상사가 뭔가를 곰곰이 생각하며 말했다. “심 지어 저희가 여기서 2시간가량을 반강제로 머물러야한다고 해도 말입니다. 어떻게 되겠죠. 여기 분들은 이 주변에서 늪지대까지의 거리가  어느 정도라고 말들 하십니까? 1.6킬로미터 이상은 아니겠죠?, 제 추측이지만서도.”\\n“딱 1.6킬로미터입니다.”라고 조 부인(주인공의  친누나)이  말했다. “그럼 됐군요. 저희들은 땅거미가 질 때까지는 늪지대 가까이에 다\\n다라야 하거든요. ‘해질녘 직전까지’가 제가 받은 명령들입니다. 어쨌    든 일이 잘  풀이겠는데요.”\\n\\u3000“죄수들 때문입니까? 상사.” 웹슬(교회서기, ‘웝슬’보단 ‘웹슬’이란 이름의 어감이 더 좋아서 제가 그냥 바꿨음) 씨가 너무도 당연한 걸 물었다.\\n\\u3000너무도 당연한 질문에 “아아!”라고 상사가 답했다. “두 명이죠. 놈들이 아직 늪지대에 잠복해있다고 들었습니다. 어쨌든 놈들은 해지기 전에는 절대 그곳을 벗어나지 않을 테니까요. 여기계신 분들 중에 누구라도 그런 하찮은 사냥감 같은 것들을 본 적이 있으신지요?”\\n\\u3000그 자리에 있던 모두가 “아니요”라고 대답했다. 물론 확신하건데 나만 빼고 말이다. 다행히 아무도 그 사실을 눈치 채지 못했다.\\n\\u3000“좋습니다.” 상사가 말했다. “그 놈들은 곧 자신들이 둥근 올가미에 걸려든 것을 발견하게 될 겁니다. 제 예상대로라면 그들이 그 사실을 알아차리기도 전에 그 놈들은 붙잡힐 겁니다. 자, 대장장이 양반! 만약 준비 되셨다면, 국왕폐하의 병사들도 준비가 되었습니다. (수갑을 고치는  것을 시작하죠)”\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형)는 상의와 조끼와 넥타이를 풀었다. 그리곤 가죽 앞치마를 착용하고 대장간 안으로 들어갔다. 병사들 중 한 명이 대장간에 있는 목재 창문들을 열었다. 다른 병사 한 명은 화덕에 불을 지폈고, 또 다른 한 명은 풀무로 바람을 일으키기 시작했고, 나머지 병사 들은 불꽃 주의에 빙  둘러섰다.\\n\\u3000곧 불꽃이 맹렬히 타올랐다. 조가 해머 질을  시작했고 쨍쨍하는 소리가 울렸다. 다시 조가 해머 질이 시작했고 쨍쨍하는 소리가 울렸다.  우리 모두는 그가 작업하는 모습을 지켜보았다.\\n\\u3000‘곧 일어날 추격에 대한 관심’은 우리의 일반적 주의력을 장악했을   뿐만 아니라, 누나(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)로 하여금 심지어 음식을 아끼지 않는 후한사람으로 만들었다. 누나는 병사들을 위해 큰 통에서 맥주 주전자를 꺼냈다. 누나는 잔에 브랜디를 담아 상사(상급 부 사관)에게  가져다주기까지 했다.\\n\\u3000그러자 펌블추크 씨가 예리하게 지적했다. “그(상사)에게는 와인을 주셔야지오, 엄마. 와인 병에는 타르(석유)가 한  방울도  없지 않겠어요.”\\n\\u3000상사는 펌블추크 씨에게 사의(감사)를 표하며 만약 이 집에서 와인이 브랜디와 동급이라면 자신은 와인을 한 잔 마시고 싶다고 정중히 말했다. 물론 자신도 타르가 전혀 들어가 있지 않은 음료수를 더 선호 한다는 말도 잊지  않았다.\\n\\u3000상사는 와인 한 잔을 받자 국왕폐하의 건강과 크리스마스 인사들을  듬뿍 담은 후 쭉 들이켰다. 그는 와인 한 잔을 한 입 가득 몽땅 들이키고는 쩝쩝 소리를 내면서 입맛을 다셨다.\\n“괜찮은 물건(와인)이지 않소, 안 그렇소, 상사?” 펌블추크 씨가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“제가 지금 그 말을 하려던 참이었습니다.” 상사가 되받아치며 말했   다. “제가 알아맞혀볼까요. 이 물건은 당신이 가져온 것이겠지요.”\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨가 기름기가 가득 한 웃음소리를 내며 말했다. “아아, 아 아?(-_-) 어째서죠?”\\n\\u3000“왜냐하면,” 상사가 손바닥으로  그(펌블추크  삼촌)의  어깨를 ‘탁’치며 말했다. “당신은 뭐가 뭔지를 아시는 분 같아 보이기 때문입니다.”\\n\\u3000“그렇게 생각하시오?” 펌블추크 씨가 또 좀 전과 같은 그 느끼한 웃 음소리를 내며 말했다. “상사에게 한 잔 더!”\\n\\u3000“친한 친구와의 한잔이라면 야,” 상사가 되받아치며 말했다. “제 와인 잔 꼭대기를 당신 잔의 다리에까지, 당신 잔의 다리에서 내 와인  잔꼭대기까지! 쨍하고 건배 한 번, 쨍하고 건배 또 한 번, ‘글라스 하 모니카’(와인 잔에 물 넣고 통통 때리며 음악 연주하는 것)에서 나오는 최고의 선율! 당신의 건강을 위해서, 그리고 당신이 천년동안을 사시기를 바라며, 그리고 당신이 현재 이 순간보다 올바름에 대해 더 나쁜 재판관이 절대 되지 않기를 바라며!(펌블추크 삼촌의 겉과 속이 다른 행동이 지금도 가관인데, 앞으로 소설이 진행되면서 주인공에게 성공    과 좌절이 차례대로 오게 되면 하는 짓이 더 가관일 거라는 얘기임. 등장인물의 말을 빌려 디킨스가 독자들에게 들려주는 얘기임. 현실에 서도 모두 이런 유의 사람들뿐이겠지만…, 어쨌든 소설은 계속됨)”\\n\\u3000상사(상급 부사관)가 또 다시 자기 잔을 뚝딱 해치웠다(마셨다). 그리고 곧바로 한 잔 더 마실 준비가 되어 있는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000내가 보기에 펌블추크 씨(잡곡상)는 지금 상사의 환대에 들떠서 지금 마구 마셔대고 있는 그 와인이 실은 자신이 우리 집에 선물로 가져온 거라는 사실을 잊은 것만 같았다. 펌블추크 씨는 조 부인(주인공의 누나)에게서 술병을 빼앗아서는 솟구치는 유쾌함에 취해 그 와인을 이리 저리 건네주며 생색이란 생색은 자기가 다 내고 있었다. 심지어 그 와인이 나에게도 조금 돌아왔을  정도였다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨는 와인을 마시고 자유영혼이 되어선 첫 번째 와인이 다 떨어졌을 때 한 병 더 가져오라고 요구하기까지 했다. 그리곤 두 번째 와인을 후하게도 좀 전과 같이 또 이 사람 저 사람에게 따라주었다.\\n\\u3000그들이 이렇게 화덕 주위에 모여 서서 아주 그냥 끝장나게 먹고 마   시는 모습을 지켜보면서 나는 이런 생각들이 들었다.\\n\\n(아래부터  주인공의 생각들임)\\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000‘늪지대에 있는 내 도망자 친구가 지금 이들의 저녁식사를 위한  끔찍이 좋은 양념이었구나.’  생각했다.\\n\\u3000그들(사람들)은, 내 도망자 친구가 등장해 유흥을 빛나게 해주기 전에는 지금의 1/4 만큼도 즐기지 못하고 있었었다.\\n\\u3000그건 그렇고, 그들 모두가 이렇게 “그 두 명의 악한들”을 다 잡은  양 활기에 넘쳐 있을 때, 그리고 풀무(바람)들이 성난 개처럼 그 두 도망자들에게 으르렁거리고 있을 때, 그리고 화덕의 불 역시 그 두 도망 자들에게 확 타오르고 있는 것 같았을 때, 그리고 연기가 그 두 도망자들을 뒤쫓기 위해 서두려는 것만 같았을 때, 조(주인공의 매형, 대장 장이)의 해머 질과 그가 만드는 쨍쨍 소리가 그 두 도망자를 뒤쫓는 것 같았고, 조가 만들어내는 ‘불꽃이 타오르고 가라앉는 모습이’ 마치 벽 위에 있던 탁한 그림자들 모두가 동요하며 그 두 도망자들에게 똑같이 위협을 가하고 있는 것만 같았다. 그리고 시뻘겋게 단 불꽃들이 이리저리  떨어져 꺼졌다.\\n\\u3000그리고 동정심에 가득 찬 어린아이(주인공)의 상상에는, 창백한 오후의 바깥공기들이 그렇게 창백해진 것이 꼭 ‘불쌍하고 가엾은 사람들’ (도망자 2명) 때문인 것만  같았다.\\n\\n\\u3000(여기까지가 대장장이인 매형의 해머 질이 만드는  불꽃들을 보면서  든, 주인공의 생각들임. 좀 기네요.)\\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000마침내 조(주인공의 매형)가 일(수갑 수리)을 끝마쳤다. 쨍쨍 울리던 소리며 으르렁거리던 불길도 멈추었다. 조가 다시 상의를 걸쳐 입었다. 조가 용기를 내어 이렇게 제안했다. 우리들 중 몇몇은 병사들을 따라 늪지대로 내려가 이번 사냥의 결과가 어떻게 결론 나는지 봐야하지 않 겠냐고.\\n\\u3000‘펌블추크 씨(잡곡상)와 허블 씨(바퀴제조인)’는 담배 한 모금과 숙녀 분들 보호를 핑계되며 거절했다. 하지만 웹슬 씨(교회서기)는 자신이 가겠다고 만약 조가 간다면 자신도 따라가겠다고 말했다.\\n\\u3000조가 그(웹슬 씨)에게 동의를 표했다. 그리고 조 부인이 만약 허락해 준다면 나(주인공 꼬마)도 데려가겠다고 말했다. 확신하건데 우리가 굳이 따라갈 필요까지는 없었다. 하지만 조 부인(주인공의 누나, 20살차 이)이 이번 일이 어떻게 결론 날지를 매우 궁금해 했다.\\n\\u3000일이 이러니, 그녀(주인공의 누나)가 이런 말까지 덧붙였다. “총알이 박혀 산산조각 난 저 녀석(주인공 꼬마)의 머리를 가지고 돌아와선 나 보고 다시 붙이라곤 말하지마.”라고.\\n\\u3000상사(상급 부사관)가 숙녀 분들에게 정중한 작별인사를 건넸다. 그리고 펌블추크 씨와는 마치 전우(전쟁동료)와 전우가 헤어지는 것처럼 헤어졌다. 나는 궁금했다. 만약 그(상사)가 술을 한잔도 안 한 그런 말 짱한 상태에서도 저 신사의 장점들을 충분히 잘 느끼고서 그렇게 아쉬 워하며 헤어졌는지. 목구멍에 촉촉한 뭔가(술)가 들어오려고 할 때는 그렇게 잘도 저 신사의 장점을 느끼더니만 말이다.\\n\\u3000그(상사)의 부하들이 머스킷총(화승총)들을 다시 챙겼다. 병사들이 정렬했다.\\n상사는 ‘웹슬 씨, 조, 그리고 나’ 이렇게 세 명에게는 단단한 다짐을 받았다. 반드시 행렬의 뒤쪽에 있을 것이며 어떠한 경우에도 우리가 늪지대에 다다를 때까지 단 한 마디도 해선 안 된다는 다짐 말이다.\\n\\u3000우리 모두가 그렇게 ‘날것 그대인(불쾌한)’ 밖으로 나와 착실하게 우 리의 임무 지를 향해 움직일 때 내가 조에게 마치 반역이라도 피우는 것처럼 속삭이며 말했다. “조, 난 이 사람들이 그들(죄수 2명)을 못 찾았으면 좋겠어요.”\\n\\u3000그러자 조가 내게 이렇게 귓속말을 했다. “만약 그들(죄수 2명)이 뺑 소니를 쳤다면 내가 5천원을 주마, 핍(주인공 이름).” (19세기 1실링은 지금 돈 5천 원 정도임~. 물가기준)\\n\\u3000우리 일행은 마을 사람 누구와도 마주치지 않았다. 날씨가 춥고 위 협적인데다 황량해 땅이 걷기 나빴고 무엇보다 이젠 어둠이 밀려오고 있었기 때문이다. 사람들은 실내에서 따뜻한 불들을 쬐며 하루를 정리 하고  있었을 것이다.\\n\\u3000몇몇 사람들의 얼굴이 밝게 빛나는  창문들 너머로 보였다. 실제 그들의 시선이 우리를 뒤쫓기도 했지만 나와 보는 사람은 아무도 없었다.\\n\\u3000우리는 ‘손가락 모양의 도표’(길 안내판)를 지나 곧장 늪지대쪽으로 직행했다.\\n\\u3000상사(상급 부사관)의 부하 두 세 명이 무덤가 사이로 흩어져 현관(지붕이 있고 벽이 둘러진 현관)을 조사했다. 그 동안 우리는 상사의 손 신호에 따라 거기서 몇 분간 정지했다.\\n병사들이 결국 아무것도 찾지 못하고 돌아왔다.\\n\\u3000이제 우리는 단호한 태도를 취하며 ‘교회  부속의 묘지 쪽’에 있는  문을 통과해 활짝 열린 늪지대로 접어들었다.\\n\\u3000매서운 ‘진눈깨비’(비가 섞여 내리는 눈)가 동풍을 타고 우리 쪽으로 심하게 와 부딪쳤다. 그러자 조(주인공의 매형)가 나를 등에 태워주었다.\\n\\u3000그 순간 우리는 음침한 황무지에 도착했다. 사람들은 내(주인공 꼬 마)가 “8시간 전이나 9시간 전에 여기(황무지)로 와 저기에 숨어있던 두 남성을 보았을 거”라고는 생각지 못했다.\\n\\u3000황무지에 도착해 가장 먼저 내 머리에 떠오른 것은, “만약 우리가 그들(죄수 2명)과 마주친다면, 나와 특별한 관계가 있는 그 기결수(죄 수)가 이  병사들을 여기로 데리고 온  것이  바로 나(주인공)라고  생각하진  않을까?”하는 문제였다.\\n\\u3000그와 처음 만났을 때 그가 나에게 이렇게 말했었기 때문이다. “네 녀석이 인간을 속이는 임프(난쟁이 요정, 사람을 도와주는 척하며 뒤로는 음모를 꾸미길 좋아하는 키 작은 악당요정)인지? 아닌지?” 그리고  이 말도 했었다. “만약 네 녀석이 나(죄수)를 뒤쫓는 사냥에 동참한다면 넌 영락없는 사나운 어린 사냥개가 틀림없다”라고.\\n\\u3000그가 혹시 이렇게 생각하지나 않을까? 내(주인공)가 정말로 배반할 마음을 먹은 ‘임프(악당요정)와 사냥개’ 둘 다였고 그래서 지금 이렇게 그를 배반했었다고.\\n\\u3000이제 와서 그런 질문(자책감)들을 해본들 아무 소용이 없다. 나는 그때 분명 거기(늪지대)에 있었고, 그것도 조(주인공의 매형)의 등에 업혀서, 그리고  나를 업은 조가 마치 한 명의 사냥꾼인 양 배수로를 향해 돌진하면서 웹슬 씨에게 (웹슬 씨의) 매부리코가 땅에 박혀 굴러 떨어지지 않도록 우리들을 잘 따라오라고 격려하고 있는 상황 속에서는 말이다.\\n\\u3000우리 앞쪽에 있던 병사들이 서로 간에 일정한 간격을 유지한 채 일 직선을 그리며 아주 널찍하게 펼쳐 섰다.\\n\\u3000우리는, 내가 일찍이 가려다 그만 안개 속으로 빠지고 말았던 그 코스 길로 들어서고 있었다. 안개가 다시 끼지 않았거나 혹은 바람이  안개를 쫓아 버린 것 같았다. 해질녘의  낮고 붉은  섬광 아래에서, “봉수  대, 교수대, 포대의 언덕, 건너편의 강가”가 분명하게 보였다. 비록 그 모두가 물에 젖은 납 색깔을 띠고 있었지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000내 심장은 조의 넓은 어깨 위에서 마치 대장장이처럼 쿵쿵거리고 있었다. 나는 죄수들의 사소한 흔적 하나라도 발견하기 위해 여기저기를 두리번거렸다. 아무도 보이지 않았다. 어떤 소리도 들리지 않았다.\\n\\u3000웹슬 씨(연극배우가 꿈인 교회서기)의 획획 하는 숨소리와 깊은 한숨 소리가 나를 한 번 이상 아주 놀라게 했다.\\n\\u3000그러나 이제는 그 소리를 알 수 있었고, ‘웹슬 씨의 숨소리’를 ‘추적 대상’과 구별해 파악할 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 내가 줄(쇠사슬을 자르는 도구) 소리를 들은 것만 같았을 때 굉장히 무서워지기 시작했다. 하지만 그 소리는 그냥 양의 목에 매달린  종 소리였다.\\n양들이  식사를  멈추고  소심하게  우리를  쳐다보았고,  소들이 바람과\\n진눈깨비(비가 섞여 내리는 눈)를 피해 고개를 돌렸다. 소들은 이런 표 정으로 우리를 쳐다보는 것 같았다. 우리가 지금 이 두 가지 성가심(바 람과 진눈깨비) 모두에 대해 책임이 있다는 듯.\\n\\u3000하지만 “이러한 것들(바람과 진눈깨비)”과 “모든 풀잎이 저무는 날씨에 몸서리를 치고 있는 것”을 제외하고는, 지금 이 늪지대에서 적막 함을 깨는 것은 아무것도  없었다.\\n\\u3000병사들이 ‘오래된 포대’(포병부대가 버리고 간 시설물)쪽 방향으로 이동하기 시작했다. 우리도 조금 뒤에 떨어져서 그들을 따라가고 있었다. 그때 갑자기 우리 모두 멈춰 섰다.\\n\\u3000‘한 줄기 비바람’에 섞여 ‘한 마디 긴 외침’이 들려왔기 때문이다. 그 소리가 반복되어 들렸다. 동쪽 멀리서 들리는  소리였지만  그  외침은 분명 길고 컸다. 아니, 두 사람 혹은 그 이상 되는 사람들이 함께 외쳐 대는 소리 같았다. 소리에서 나는 혼란으로 판별해 보건데 그러했다. ‘상사(상급 부사관)’와 ‘그와 가장 가까이에 있던 병사’가 이 소리를 가 지고 숨죽이며 얘기를 교환하고 있을 때, 조와 내가 그곳에 도착했다.  그 소리를 다시 한 번 들어본 후, 좋은 재판관이었던 조가 그들의 의견에 동의했다. 그리고 나쁜 재판관이었던 웹슬 씨(교회서기)가 그들에게 동의했다.\\n\\u3000상사는 결정적인 한 방(단호한 결의)이 있는 사람이었다. 상사가 저 소리에 대답해서는 안 된다는 명령을 부하들에게 내렸다. 상사가 진로 (길)를 변경해 “두 사람의 소리”가 나고 있는 그 방향으로 나아가라고 부하들에게 명령했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 우리는 길을 오른쪽으로 틀었다. 그쪽이 동쪽이었다. (외침이 동쪽에서 들려오고 있다) 그리고 조가 아주 놀랍게도 땅에 맹폭격을 가하며 성큼성큼 걷기 시작했다. 나는 조의 등에서 떨어지지 않으려고 그를 꽉 붙잡아야했다.\\n\\u3000이젠 정말 달음박질이었다. 이때 조(주인공의 매형)가 한 말은 딱 두 마디뿐이었다. 그가 맨날 하는 말인 “빠르게! 힘차게!”였다. 그가 둑들 아래로 내려갔고 다시 둑들 위로 올라갔다. 그리곤 수많은 수문(강에 설치한 물)들을 건너뛰었고 도랑들을 첨벙첨벙 건넌 후 골풀(높이가 50~100센티미터인 등심초, 잡풀)들 사이를 파헤치며 달렸다. 우리 모두 정신없이 뛰고 있었다. 고함소리가 들리는  곳이  가까워짐에  따라 이젠 모든 것이 명백했다. 그 소리는 한 사람 이상이 만들어내고 있는 소리였다.\\n\\u3000가끔 소리가 동시에 멎었다. 병사들도 멈추었다. 다시 외침이 터져 나왔다. 그 소리를 향해 병사들이 전보다 빠른 속도로 뛰어갔다. 우리도  병사들을 뒤따랐다.\\n\\u3000잠시 후 우리가 그들을 찾아냈다. 우리는 한 사람(죄수)이 이렇게 말 하는 것이 들을 수 있었다. “살인이다!” 그리고 다른 사람(죄수)이 이렇게 말하는 것을 들을 수 있었다. “여기 죄수들이 있다! 도망자들이 있다! 경비대원들! 도망갔던 죄수들이 여기 있다!”라고.\\n\\u3000그러더니 두 목소리들 모두 전투중인지 숨이 탁탁 막히는 것이 들렸다. 또 다시 두 죄수의 고함이 터져 나왔다. 그 고함과 함께 병사들이 사슴처럼 뛰기 시작했고 조 역시 사슴처럼 뛰기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000소리 나는 곳에 다 왔을 때 상사(상급 부사관)가 첫 번째로 뛰어들었고 그의 뒤를 쫓아 다른 두 부하가 뛰어들었다. 그들을 뒤따라 우리 모두 달려들었을 때, 병사들의 총은 이미 공이치기(격발장치)가 젖혀진 (장전) 후 총구멍을 죄수들에게 겨누고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“여기  두 놈 모두 있다!” 도랑(시궁창) 아래에서 있는 힘껏 싸우고  있던 상사가 숨을 헐떡거리며 말했다. “항복해, 둘 다! 이 빌어먹을 짐승 같은 자식들아! 둘 다 떨어지지 못해!”라고. \\n\\u3000사방으로 물이 튀고 있었고 진흙이 날아다니고 있었다. 무수한 욕설 들이 오고 가고 있었고 그에 발마추어 주먹들이 오고 가고 있었다. 그리고 그때 좀 더 많은 병사들이 상사(상급 부사관)를 돕기 위해 도랑 (시궁창) 속으로 내려가 ‘내 죄수’(주인공이 빵을 주었던 죄수)와 ‘다른 죄수’를 따로따로 끌어냈다. 두 죄수 모두 피를 흘리고 있었고 헐떡거  리고 있었으며 입에서는 쉴 새 없이 서로를 저주하는 말들을 내뱉으며 발악하고 있었다. 당연히 난 그들 둘 다를 즉시 알아보았다.\\n\\u3000“잘 들어두시오!” 내 죄수가 거친 소매로 자신의 얼굴에 묻은 피를 닦으며 말했다. 그리고 자기 손가락에서 (상대방에게) 뜯긴 머리를 털어내면서 말했다.  “내가 저 놈을  잡았소! 내가 당신들에게 저 놈을 넘긴 거요! 명심해두시오! 내가 저 놈을 넘긴 거라는 사실을.”\\n\\u3000“그게 뭐 대수야.”라고 상사가 말했다. “그래 봤자 네 놈에게 돌아갈   건 거의 없어, 이 친구야, 그리고 네 처지도 똑같을 거고. 저것들에게  수갑 채워!”\\n\\u3000“난 저 자를 잡은 것이 내게 어떤 이득이 되리리라 생각지는 않소.   지금 이렇게 된 것으로도 족하오. 난 이 보다 더 많은 이득을 원하지 않았소.” 내 죄수가 탐욕스럽게 웃으며 말했다. “내가 저 놈을 잡은 거요, 저 놈은 알지. 내가 저 놈을 잡았다는 것을. 난 그거면 족하오.”\\n\\u3000다른 죄수가 노발대발해 내 죄수를 쳐다보았다. 게다가 다른 죄수의 얼굴 왼쪽 편에는 멍이 있었다. 멍은 오래 전에 생긴 것 같았다. 또한 그(다른 죄수)의 얼굴 곳곳에도 멍 자국이 있었으며 군데군데 얼굴이 찢겨져 있었다. 두 죄수가 따로 떼어져 손목에 수갑이 채워질 때까지  그는 얘기할 숨조차 고를 수 없었다(숨이 차 얘기할 수 없었다). 오직  자기 몸이 넘어지지 않도록 병사 한 명에게 자기 몸을 기대고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“유념해두시오, 경비원, 그가 나를 죽이려했소.” 이것이 그(다른 죄 수)가 한 첫 번째  말이었다.\\n\\n\\u3000(잠깐 : 두 죄수가 싸운 사건은 소설 속에서 상당히 중요한 요소입니다. 이들의 싸움은 소설 후반부에서 재연되며 주인공의 삶은 물론 여타 주변 인물들의 운명에 지대한 영향을 끼치며 소설을 혼란 속으로  밀어 넣게 됩니다. 물론 이 블로그시리즈가 소설 후반부까지 지탱가능 하다면 말이죠.ㅋㅋ 즐감하세요~ 아직 주변인물들이 등장도 하지 않았 지만~ )\\n\\n\\u3000(앞 뒤 상황 설명 좀 더 : ‘내 죄수’는 폭력전과가 있고 고아이며 학교를 한 번도 다녀보지 못한 행동 대장 혹은 똘마니 혹은 심부름꾼이었고, ‘다른 죄수’는 당시 옥스퍼드대학까지 나온 지능형 사기꾼임. 범 죄가 드러나려 하자 ‘다른 죄수’가 음모를 꾸며 ‘내 죄수’를 대신 잡혀 가게 해 ‘내 죄수’는 몇 십 년이고 감옥에 갇혔고, ‘다른 죄수’는 성질을 못 버리고 또 다시 사기를 여러 번 치다가 들통이 나 잡혀 왔는데,  이들 둘이 우연히 감옥 선에서 만나게 되자 ‘내 죄수’가 ‘다른 죄수’를 죽이려고  달려든 것임)\\n\\u3000“그를  죽이려고 했다고?” 내 죄수(소설 첫 부분에서 주인공이 빵을 준 죄수)가 업신여기며 말했다. “시도했는데, 왜 죽이지 않았을까? 내가 그를 잡았고 내가 그를 넘긴 것이오. 그게 내가 원한 거야. 나는 그가 이 늪지대들을 벗어나지 못하게 막았을 뿐만 아니라 내가 그를 여   기로 질질 끌고 왔던 거요. 내가 저 놈 뒤를 뒤쫓아 가서 여기까지 놈을 끌고 온 거란 말이요. 그래 그는 신사지, (신사라고 불리는 사실에 짜증스러워하며 경멸조로) 세상에, 저 악한이. 자,  이제  감옥선이 저 신사 분을 다시 탑승시킬 거요 다 내 덕택이지. 그런데 내가 그를 살 해하려했었다고? 저놈을  살해하는 게  내게 무슨 보람이 있소.  내가   더 나쁜 짓도 할 수 있었을 때 내가 왜 그를 다시 여기로 끌고 왔겠어!”\\n\\u3000다른 죄수는 여전히 숨을 헐떡이며  짧게, 짧게 이렇게 말하고  있었다. “그가 나를, 나를, 나를 살해하려했소. 증인이 있소.”\\n\\u3000“이거 보시오!” 내 죄수가 상사(상급 부사관)를 보며 말했다. “나는  남들 도움 없이 혼자서 감옥선을 탈출했소. 나는 질주했고 이미 다 성공했었소. 이 죽도록 차가운 평지를 벗어날 수 있었을 거란 말이오. 그 런데 내가 왜? 내 다리를 보시오. 그 많던 쇠가 다 어디로 갔겠소. 내가 만약 그가 여기에 있다는 사실만 발견하지 않았어도 아마도 난 지금쯤. 그런데 그가 달아나게 내가 내버려둔다고? 내가 발견한 수단들 (감옥선 탈출수단들)을 가지고 그가 탈출을 했는데 나보고 그가 재미를 보게 내버려두라고? 내가 또 다시 저 놈의 도구가 되는 상황을 나   보고 넋 놓고 보고 있으라고? 또 다시? 아니지, 아니야, 아니고말고.   내가 저 시궁창 바닥에서 죽었다면 또 모를까, 그럼 안 되고말고.”\\n그(내 죄수)가 수갑이  채워진  자신의 양손으로  도랑(시궁창)을   가리키며 단호하게 흔들어보였다. “난 그를 꽉 움켜쥐고 있었소. 그래서 당 신들이 내 손아귀에 잡혀있는 그를 안전하게 찾아낼 수 있었던 거요.”\\n\\u3000동료 죄수에 대해 끔찍한 공포를 가지고 있다는 사실을 증명하듯 다른 도망자가 이렇게 되풀이해 말했다. “그가 나를 죽이려고 했소. 만약 당신들(병사들)이 오지 않았다면 난 벌써 죽은 목숨이었을 것이오.”\\n\\u3000“거짓말이야!”라고 내 죄수가 맹렬한 에너지를 온 몸으로 발산하며 말했다. “이 뼛속까지 거짓말인 작자야. 저자는 거짓말쟁이로 죽을 거요. 저자의 얼굴을  좀 보시오! 저 얼굴에 다 쓰여 있지 않소?

그가 악한이라는 걸 당신도 봤소? 저자의 저 굽실거리는 두 눈, 저자의 저 종잡을 수 없이 헤매는 듯한 저 두 눈을 보고 있냔 말이오? 저거요 저게 바로 우리가 함께 재판받던 날 저자가 지어보인 표정이었소. 저자는 결코 나를 쳐다보지 않았소.”\\n\\u3000다른 죄수는 한시도 가만있지 못했다. 그는 자신의  마른 입술을 계속 움직이고 있었고, 그의 두 눈은 자기 주변 여기저기 먼 곳 가까운  곳 가리지 않고 쉴 새 없이 이동하고 있었다. 결국  그런 그의  두 눈이 잠시 동안 화자(얘기하고 있는 죄수)에게 가 꽂혔을 때 그가 이런 말을 했다. “네 녀석 몰골도 만만치 않다.” 그리곤 묶여 있던 두 손을 반 쯤은 비웃듯 흘끗  쳐다보았다.\\n\\u3000그러자 내 죄수(소설 앞부분에서 주인공 꼬마가 빵을 건네준 죄수) 가 거의 미친 듯이 분노해서는 그에게 돌진하려했고 병사들이 가까스로 내 죄수를 제지해야만  했다.\\n\\u3000일이 이쯤 되자 다른 죄수가 상사에게 이렇게 말했다. “내가 당신에게 말하지 않았소, 저자는 할 수만 있으면 언제든 나를 죽이려들 것이 라고?”\\n\\u3000그 자리에 있던 누구도 볼 수 있었다. 그(다른 죄수)가 지금 두려움에 질러 몹시 동요하고 있다는 사실을. 그(다른 죄수)의 입술 위에 기 이하고 하얀, 얇은 눈 같은 ‘조각들’(긴장에 따른 입 거품)이 발생하고 있다는 사실을.\\n\\u3000“얘기는 이만하면 충분해.”라고 상사(상급 부사관)가 말했다. “저기 횃불들부터 밝혀라.”\\n\\u3000총 대신에 바구니를 들고 다니던 ‘병사 하나’가 자기 무릎 위에 바구니를 내려놓더니 뚜껑을  열어젖혔다.\\n\\u3000내 죄수가 처음으로 자기 주변으로  눈을 돌렸다. 그가 나를 발견했다. ‘나는’ 그때 조(주인공의 매형)의 등에서 내려 우리가 올라온 도랑(시궁창)의  ‘언저리(끝) 위에  서 있었다.’ 나는 혈투가  벌어지는  내내  그  자리에  서서  움직이지 않고  있었다. 그가 나를 살짝  쳐다보았을 때 나는 정말 열심히 그를 쳐다보고 있었었다. 내가 그에게 두 손을 살짝 움직이며 고개를 흔들어 보였다(내가 고발하지 않았다고 표정을 지어 보였다).\\n\\u3000나는 내 무죄(위치를 군인들에게 알리지 않았음)를 그에게 확인시켜 주기 위해 제발 그가 나를 한 번만이라도 좋으니 쳐다만 봐달라고 애 원하고 있었었다. 그런데 그가 너무 한순간만 나를 쳐다보곤 다른 곳으로 시선을 돌리는 통에, 그가 내 의도(무죄)를 이해했는지조차 내게    는 전혀 명확하지 않았다. 거기다 그는 내가 이해할 수 없는 표정(눈 길)을 내게 지어보였고 그 짧은 순간조차도 금방 지나가버렸기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그러나 그의 얼굴은 내게 큰 인상을 남겼다. 그가 만약 나를 ‘한 시 간’이나 ‘한 나절’ 동안 쳐다보았다면 그렇게 내 주의를 끌진 못했을 것이다. 그리고 내가 그를 다시 만났을 때에도 이 사건을 기억해내지 못했을 것이다. 그랬다면 더 좋았을 텐데.\\n\\u3000(주인공이 그를 지극히 짧은 순간만 쳐다볼 수 있었기 때문에 그게  더 주의 깊게 그를 쳐다보게 만들었고, 그것이 음식을 훔쳐 죄수에게 가져다주었다는 어린 아이의 죄의식과 어린 시절 널 혼자였던 기억과 섞이고 이후 그를 괴롭힌 여러 가지 사건들(첫사랑)과 한데 어우러져  결국 자신을 괴롭혀왔다는 얘기 아닐까요?

그렇지 않소? 미안하다기 보단, 어쨌든 그 파이 내가 먹었소.”\\n\\u3000“누가 알겠소, (싫지만) 얼마든지 드시오. 다만 그게 내(대장장이 조) 것일 때만 말이오.”라며 조가 ‘조 부인’(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)을 가까스로 생각해내곤 되받아쳤다. “우리는 당신이 먹었다는 사실조차 몰랐습니다. 하지만 우리도 당신이 그것 때문에 굶어 죽게 되지는 바라지 않았을 겁니다. 가난하고 불쌍한 이 친구를 말이야. 그렇지, 핍 (주인공  이름,  아직은 꼬마)?”\\n\\u3000내가 전에도 주목했었던 것이 있다. 내  죄수의 목에서 다시 “찰깍”하는 소리가 났다. 그리고 내 죄수는 내게서 등을 돌려버렸다(내 눈이 그의  등을 봤다).\\n\\u3000보트가 되돌아왔다. 그리고 ‘내 죄수 담당 경비요원’이 준비를 했다. 그래서 우리는 그(죄수)를 따라 거친 말뚝들과 돌들로 만들어진 부두까지 걸어갔다.\\n\\u3000그(죄수)가 보트에 오르는 모습을 지켜보았다. 그와 같은 복장을 한 승무원죄수들이 노를 젓는 보트였다. 승무원죄수들 어느 누구도 내 죄 수를 보고 놀라거나 관심을 표하거나 혹은 그를 반기거나 또는 탈출한 그를 다시 만나게 된 것을 애석해 하거나 혹은 말이라도 한 번 건네지 않았다.\\n\\u3000다만 보트에 탄 누군가가 마치 개들에게 으르렁거리듯 승무원죄수들 에게 으르렁거리듯 말을 하고  있을  뿐이었다. “이것들아, 기브웨이다  (노 저어)!” 그 소리는 노들을 수면에 적시라는 신호였다.

(‘2륜 경마차’는 ‘바퀴가 두 개인 마차’)\\n\\u3000이때 웹슬 씨(연극배우가 꿈인 교회서기)가 참말로 한 마리 야생마처럼 “그렇지 않소!”라고 외쳐댔다. 그 눈빛 있지 않는가? 피곤에 지쳐 체력이 아주 끝장 난 사람들의 눈에서 가끔 보이곤 하는 허약한 적의 (악의)를 띄며 웹슬 씨가 “그렇지 않소!”라고 말했던 것이다.\\n\\u3000하지만  웹슬 씨는  아무런 이론도 가지고 있지  않았다. 무엇보다 그는 지금 외투도 전혀 걸치지 있지 않았따. 당연히 그의 의견은 만장일 치로 무시당했다. 그의 의견이 무시당하는 데에는 그의 등 뒤에서 피 어나고 있던 김(연기)도 한 몫 했다. 외투에서 습기가 빨리 빠져나가게 하려고 부엌 난로 가에 등을 돌리고 서 있었기 때문에 그의 등에서 김이 모락모락 피어났던 것이다. 그의 몰골이 그러하니 사람들에게서 신 뢰를 받지 못한 것이었다.\\n\\u3000이것이 내가 그날 밤에 들은 전부다. 이후 나는 꾸벅꾸벅 졸았는데 누나가 나를 손님들의 눈에 거슬리는 존재로 생각해 나를 (아프게) 와락 움켜잡고는 침대(다락방에 있는 주인공의 침대)에까지 데려다주는 배려를 해주었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 누나가 어찌나 심하게 나를 움켜잡고 계단을 올라가든지, 마치 내가 50개의 부츠(신발)들을 신고 있고, 그 50개의 부츠들이 모두 계단들 끝들에 달랑달랑 거려지고 있는 것 같았다(누나가 주인공을 계 단에 마구 부딪치며  올라갔다).\\n\\u3000내가 이미 앞부분에서 묘사했듯이, ‘내 심리상태’(양심의 가책)는 그날 아침 일어나기 전에 이미 “갖추어지기 시작해” 그 사안(음식을 훔쳐다 죄수에게 갖다 준 것)이 완전히 자취를 감춘 뒤에도 오랜 시간 지속되었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 아주 예외적인 경우들에서만 ‘내 심리상태’(양심)가 “나를 구해 달라.”고 말하는 것을 멈추었었다. (주인공의 이런 심리상태를 더 악화시키는 것은 소설 중반부터 나올 여주인공의 존재이고, 자신의 비 천한 신분 탓에 그녀에게 다가가지 못하는 자신의 모습과 그녀가 그런 자신을 멸시하면 할수록 수그러드는 허약한 자신감 탓이다.)\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 7장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000내가 ‘교회 부속의 묘지’에서 가족(주인공의 부모님과 일찍 죽은 다섯 명의 동생들)들의 묘비를 읽으며 서 있었을 쯤에는, 철자를 옳게 말할 정도까지는 막 배운 상태였다. 다만 머릿속에서 아직 그 철자들의 구분이 명확하지 않았는데, 내가 “이 무덤 위에 누워계시는 부인은”이 라고 읽으면 나는 그것을 내 아버지가 천국에 올라가신 것을 찬양하기 위해 쓴 글인 줄 아는 식이었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 만약 내가 죽은 친척들의 묘비에서 “아래의”라는 글을 발견하게 된다면 나는 한 치의 의심도 없이 그 가족구성원에 대해 최악의 평가를 내렸을 것이라는  사실이다.\\n\\u3000나를 얽매고 있던 ‘교리문답서’(젊은이를 위한 종교안내서)에 대한 신자로서의 내 관념들 역시 정확함과는 전혀 거리가 멀었다.\\n\\u3000아직도 생생하게 기억하는 것이 있다. 나는 내가 “한 평생 한길로만 행하리(걸어가리).”라고 선언한 한 이상, 우리 집에서 마을을 지나갈 때에는 꼭 한 방향으로만 통과해야할 의무가 있다고 여기는 식이었다. 절대 ‘바퀴 제조인’(허블 씨 집)의 집을 지난 후 아래쪽으로 방향을 틀 거나 또는 방앗간을 지난 후 위쪽 방향으로 틀어 길을 다양화해서는 안  된다고 생각했다.\\n\\u3000충분한 나이가 되면 나는 조(매형)의 수습공(배우는 사람)이 될 예정 이었다. 그리고 내가 그 품위(대장장이)를 떠맡을 때까지는 나는 ‘조 부인’(20살 많은 친누나)이 말하는 “사보타주”(노당자의 쟁의 수단, 일을 게을리 함)를 해서도 안 되며 “버릇없이 키워져서도 안 되었다.” 나는 사보타주란 말을 버릇없이 키워져서는 안 된다는 의미로 이해했다.\\n\\u3000그러므로 “나는” 대장간 주변의 “심부름꾼”이었을 뿐만 아니라 이웃들 중 누군가가 “새들을 쫓아낼 꼬마”가 필요하다거나 “돌을 주워 날라야 한다”거나 할 때 또는 그런 유의 “일손”이 필요할 때면 항상 고용되는  호의를 입었다.\\n\\u3000하지만, 우리의 우월한 지위가 잡일(돈) 때문에 위태롭게 되는 만약의 경우를 미연에 방지하기 위해서, 나는 부엌벽난로 선박 위에 저금통 하나를 놓아두고 “내 수입은 모두 이 저금통에 떨어질 거예요”라고 공개적으로 알려야했다.\\n\\u3000나는 그 돈들이 언젠가는 ‘국가 부채(빚)의 청산’을 위해 기부될 거라는 인상을 받았다. 하지만 내가 아는 한 내가 그 보물에 개인적으로 관여할 수 있는 희망은 전혀 없었다. (전쟁 때 돈 쉽게 끌어 모으려고 만든 영국 중앙은행은  17세기 말에  설립된 이후  처음  몇 년을 제외하 곤 매년 거의 매년 부채기록을 갈아치우고 있었음. 소설의 배경이 되는 19세기는 물론이거니와 이후 줄곧 부채가 부채를 부름. 일이 그러 함에도 영국은행은 물론 영국정부도 망하지 않았다는  이  놀라운  사 실~ 정부가 돈을 팡팡 쓰도 절대 망하지 않는 자본주의, 너 정말 놀라 워~)\\n\\u3000‘웹슬 씨’(연극배우가 꿈인 교회서기)에게는 대고모(“웹슬 씨의 할아 버지”의 누이)가 계셨다. 대고모는 마을에서 저녁학교를 운영하고 있었다. 다시 말해서 대고모는 재산은 한정되어 있고 병치레는 끝이 없는 어리석고 나이 많은 여성이었다. 그녀는 매일  저녁  6시부터 7시까지 졸곤 했는데, 아이들은 그녀의 그런 모습을 보는 호기를 얻는 대가로  매주 2천 원씩을 지불하고  있었다.\\n\\u3000대고모는 작은 집 한 채를 임대하고 있었다.  그 집 계단 위층 방에  웹슬 씨가 머물고 있었다. 우리 학생들은 웹슬 씨가 이  세상에서 가장 위엄 있는 방식으로 이 세상에서 가장 무시무시한 방식으로 책을 큰 소리로 읽으며 이따금씩 천장에 부딪치는 소리를  우연히  듣곤  했다. 웹슬 씨가 3개월마다 학생들에게 시험을 치르게 한다고 하는데 그건 꾸며낸 얘기였었다.\\n\\u3000그가 그 날 실제 하는 행동은, 이따금씩 자신의 소맷부리(손목 윗부 분)를 접어 올리고서 머리카락을 사방으로 뻗치며 “카이사르(로마 독 재자)의 시신 위에서 마르쿠스 안토니우스(카이사르의 부하장군)가 행 했던 연설을 우리들에게 다시 들려주는 것이었다.”\\n\\u3000안토니우스의 연설 뒤에는 항상 ‘콜린스’(영국 서정시인)의 “열정에 대한 송시”(‘송시’란 공덕을 기리는 시)가 뒤따랐다. 그 시의 구절 중에, “복수” 역을 맡은 웹슬 씨가 피로 얼룩진 자신의 칼을 천둥 속으로 내던지며 괴멸(멸망)적인 시선으로 전쟁 종결을 알리는 나팔을 집어드는 장면이 나오는데 그럴 때면 나는 그를 특히 존경했다.\\n\\u3000그때 당시에는 그렇지 않았지만, 내가 후년에 ‘격정의 사회’에 빠져 ‘콜린스’(시인)와 ‘웹슬 씨’(교회서기)를 다시 비교해보았을 때 ‘그들 두 신사’는 내게서 다소 불리한 판정을 받았다.\\n\\u3000‘웹슬 씨의 대고모’는 “교육기관을 운영하는 것”외에도 “작은 잡화점 (가게)을 하나” 똑같은 방에서 운영하고 있었다. 그녀는 가게에 어떤 물건들이 있는지 또는 그 물건들의 가격은 얼마인지 하는 개념 자체가 없었다. 다만 그녀의 서랍장 안에는 ‘작고 기름기가 잔득 묻은 비망록 (메모지)이 하나’ 있었는데, 그것이 가격목록표로서의 역할을 맡고 있었고 바로 그 신탁(메모지)에 의거해 ‘비디’(여자조연, 여주인공 아님, 헷갈리시면 안 됨)가 전반적인 가게의 운영을 도맡아하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000‘비디’는 손녀였다. 그러니까 비디는  “웹슬  씨의  대고모”의  손녀였 다. 솔직히 고백하건데 ‘비디’와 ‘웹슬 씨’가 어떤 혈연관계였는지 유추 하는 것은 내에게 역부족이다. 그녀는 나처럼 고아였다. 역시 나처럼 (주인공이 갓난아기일 때 부모님과 다섯 형제들이 모두 일찍 죽었음, 현재 20살 차이나는 누나만 한 명 있음) 손(매 맞기)수 길러졌을 것이다.\\n\\u3000내 생각에 ‘두 팔과 두 다리’에 관한한 그녀는 남의 눈을 잘 끄는 스 타일이었다. 예를 들면 그녀의 머리는 항상 빗질(머리 빗기)이 필요해 보였고 그녀의 두 손은 항상 손 씻기가 필요해보였다.(당시 비누가 판 매되고 있었음) 그리고 그녀의 구두는 항상 수선이 필요해보였고 구두 뒤꿈치는 좀 더 치켜세울 필요가 있어 보였다. 다만 이런 묘사는 평일 에만 한정된 경우인데, 그녀는 일요일이면 자신을 정성들여 꾸민 후 교회로 예배 보러 갔기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000많은 부분을 남들 도움 받지 않고 나 혼자서, 그리고 ‘웹슬 씨의 대 고모’보다는 ‘비디’에게서 더 많은 도움을 받아가며 나는 알파벳을 헤쳐 나가기 위해 투쟁하고 있었다. 내게는 알파벳이 마치 ‘가시나무 수풀’인 것 같았다. 알파벳은 매 글자마다 나를 점점 더 당황하게 만들으며 매 글자마다 나를 점점 더 손톱으로 할퀴었다.\\n\\u3000그 후 나는 ‘9개의 숫자들이란 몹쓸 도둑놈들’ 사이로 떨어졌는데, 이 도둑놈들(숫자)은 매일 저녁 새로운 짓을 해가며 자신들을 위장함으로써 내가 도저히 알아차릴 수도 없게 만들고 있었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 많은 지체와 노력 끝에 나는 마침내 손으로 더듬는 반소경(한쪽 눈이 안 보이는)의 방식으로 읽고 쓰고 계산하기 시작했다. 물론 가장 작은 스케일로  말이다.\\n\\u3000어느 날 밤이었다. 나는 굴뚝 구석에 앉아 석판(글씨 쓰는 판) 위에다 조(매형)에게 보내는 편지 한 통을 작성하기 위해 아주 진땀을 다 빼고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내 생각에 그건 우리가 늪지대에서 추적을 마치고 돌아온 지 일 년이 지난 때였던 것 같다. 시간도 많이 흘렀고 겨울인데다가 또 된서리 (땅 위에 생긴 잔 얼음)가 심하게 내렸던 어느 날 밤이었다.\\n\\u3000난로 위 내 발 가까이에 알파벳 판을 참고용으로 펼쳐놓고, 난 한  두 시간을 몽땅 다 투자해 용케도 다음과 같은 내용의 편지를 작성할 수 있었다. 물론 곳곳에 문지르고 지운 흔적이 잔득했지만. 어쨌든 편지  내용은 이러했다.\\n\\u3000“나으 친애하는 ‘조’ 나 희망 잘 지내여 희망 바래 그녀 아들 ㅂ 하벨 4 2 가리켜 당신 ‘조’ 안 그때 우린 아주  좋으을  거네여 제가 수스 업공 2 되믄 당신 조 나를 밋어여 친애하느 핍으러부더.”\\n\\u3000그(조)가 내 옆에 앉아 있었고 우리 둘만 있었기 때문에 내가 굳이 조와 편지로 의사소통해야할 피할 수 없는 이유가 전혀 없었었다. 하지만 나는 내가 직접 작성한 통신문을 조에게 인도했다. 통신문이라 해보았자 석판과 글씨가 다였지만, 조는 그 편지가 마치 박식(깊은 지 식)의 경이로운 사례인양  받아들였다.\\n\\u3000“이봐, 핍(주인공의 이름), 이 친구야!”라며 조가 외쳤다. 그는 푸른  두 눈을 활짝 뜬 채 이렇게 말했다. “대단한 학식이로구나! 그렇지 않니?”\\n\\u3000“저도 그렇게 되고자 해요.” 그가 들고 있는 석판을 내가 힐끗 쳐다보며 말했다. 아무리 생각해도 글자에 굴곡(곡선)이 다소 많은 게 아닌가 하는 걱정을 하면서 말이다.\\n\\u3000“왜 있잖아, 여기 말이다 ㅈ” 조가 말했다.  “무엇이든 감당할 수 있는 ‘오’도 있구나! 이런 세상에 여길 봐봐 ㅈ도 있고 오도 있어, 핍, 그 러니까 여기 ㅈ―오,  ‘조’구나.”\\n\\u3000나(주인공, 아직은 꼬마)는 조(매형)가 이런 유의 단음절(음이 하나인 단어, ‘조’)이상을 소리 내 읽는 것을 들은 적이 없었다. 지난 일요일 날 교회예배 때 난 뜻하지 않게 기도서를 거꾸로 들게 되었는데  그(조)가 그것(거꾸로 든 기도서)을 보고도 자신의 편의에 맞는다는 듯 조용했었다. 마치 기도서가 똑바로 들려있든 거꾸로 들려있던 그는 크게 상관치 않는다는 태도였다. 나는 지난 일요일 예배 때 이를 목격했었다.\\n\\u3000지금 이 기회를 기꺼이 받아들인 나는 조를 가르칠 경우 완전히 기초부터 시작해야하는지 여부를 알아보기 위해 이렇게 말했다. “아! 나머지 부분도 읽어봐,  조(매형이름).”\\n\\u3000“나머지 부분, 응, 핍(주인공이름)?” 조가 천천히 그러면서도 면밀히 석판(편지)을 살펴보면서 말했다. “하나, 둘, 셋. 이런, 여기에 ‘ㅈ’이 세 개 있고, 그리고 ‘오’가 세 개 있고,  그리고  ‘ㅈ―오’도  있으니까, ‘조’가 안에 있어,  핍!”\\n\\u3000나는 조 너머로 몸을 기울여 내 집게손가락으로 그가 편지내용 전체를 읽을 수 있도록  도와주었다.\\n\\u3000“우와 정말 놀랍구나!”라며 조가 말했다. 내가 마지막 글자까지 다 읽어주었을 때 조는 너무 기뻐했다. “넌 이제 학자가 다 되었어.”라고. “가저리(매형 성씨) 철자가 어떻게 돼, 조?” 나는 이 세상에서 가장 얌전한 자세로 조용히 뒤에서 도와주겠다는 태도를 견지한 채 물어보\\n았다.\\n“나는 내 성씨의 철자를 전혀 알지 못한단다.” 조가 말했다. “하지만 대충 짐작은 할 수 있잖아?”\\n“아니 짐작도 못해, 핍.” 조가 말했다. “나도 역시 글 읽기를 굉장히 좋아하지만 말이다.” \\n“정말로, 조?”\\n\\u3000“보통의 경우엔 그렇단다. 어서” 조가 말했다. “성서나 좋은 신문 하나를 내 손에 줘보렴, 그럼 난 좋은 벽난로 앞에 앉아서 이렇게 말할 거란다, ‘이 이상은 더 바라지 않아요. 주님!’이라고.” 그(조)가 손으로 자기 무릎을 살짝 비벼댄 후 계속 말했다. “그건 이런 식이란다. 만약  네가 ‘ㅈ’과 ‘오’를 알아차리게 되면 말이다. 그럼 넌 이렇게 말하는 거지. ‘이거였군요. 결국 이거였어요, 주님. ‘ㅈ―오’는 ‘조’였어요, 주님.’  이 얼마나 흥미로운  읽을거리니!”\\n\\u3000나는 이쯤에서 하나의 사실을 더 알아차리게  되었다. 스팀(증기)과 같은 ‘조(매형이름)의 교육’이 아직 유아기 수준에 머물러 있다는 사실을 말이다. 이 문제를 좀 더 살펴보기로 한 나는 이렇게 물어보았다.\\n“학교에 다닌 적은 없어, 조, 나처럼 어릴 때 말이야?” “그래, 핍.”\\n“왜 학교에 못 다녔어, 조, 나 같이 어린 데 말이야?” \\n\\u3000“글쎄, 핍(주인공이름, 꼬마).” 조(매형이름)가 부지깽이를 집어 들며 말했다. 부지깽이를 집어 드는 것은 그가 곰곰이 생각에 빠질 때면  늘 하곤 하는 행동이었다. 아래쪽에 있는 봉들 사이로 천천히 불을 들추며  그가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“내 얘기를 해주고 싶구나, 핍. 내 아버지는 말이다. 술에 빠져 마음이 온통 술에만 가 있던 사람이란다. 그리고 술에 취한 날이면 엄마를 집요하게 때렸지. 매번 말이다. 그것도 이 세상에서 가장 무자비한 방 법으로 엄마를 때렸단다. 그게 아버지가 하는 유일한 망치질이었단다,  핍. 정말, 나를 때린 것을 빼곤 말이다. 그는 나를 힘차고 집요하게 때렸지. 그 힘은 말이다. 그가 모루(대장간에서 쇠를 두드릴 때 쓰는 쇠 받침대)에 사정없는 해머 질을 할 때의 정력과만 맞바꿀 수 있는 그런 정력으로 나를 집요하게 때렸단다. 무슨 말인지 듣고 있니, 핍, 이해하겠니?”\\n“응, 조.”\\n\\u3000“결국 ‘엄마와 난’ 그에게서 여러 번을 달아났었단다. 그런 다음 엄마는 일자리를 알아보러 나가셨지. 엄마는 이런 말을 했지. ‘우리 착한 조(이름)야’라고. 그리고 이렇게도 말했단다. ‘하느님도 기쁘시게, 너도 이제는 조금이나마 학교교육을 받을 수 있을 거란다, 얘야’라고. 엄마가 날 학교에 넣어주셨지. 하지만 아버진 심장 속에 어느 정도의 선량 함은 지니신 분이셨지. 그는 우리 없이는 견딜 수 없었어. 그래서 아버진 엄청나게 많은 사람들을 데리고 와선 우리가 지내고 있는 집의 문에서 한바탕 소동을 벌이셨지. 그러면 사람들은 우리 모자(엄마와 아 들)와 더 이상 엿일 수 없다며 우리를 아버지에게 넘겨주곤 했지. 그러고 나면 아버진 우리를 집으로 끌로가 다시 집요하게 때렸단다. 뭔지, 알겠지, 핍.”이라며 조가 말했다. 그는 말없이 마음속으로 생각에 잠긴 채 부지깽이로 불을 찾아 들추고 있었다. 그런 그가 나를 다시 쳐다보며 말했다. “내 배움은 거기서 중단되고 말았단다.”\\n“틀림없이 알아들었어, 가엾은 조!” \\n\\u3000“(아버지에 대한 어조를 누그러뜨리며) 하지만 뭐랄까, 핍.” 조가 부 지깽이로 (벽난로) 맨 위쪽에 있는 봉(막대기)을 재판관처럼 한 번 두  번 톡톡 건드린 후 말했다. “모든 자에게 줄 것을 주되, 남자대 남자로서 동등한 정의를 유지한 채 말을 하자면, 내 아버진 심장 속에 어느 정도의 선량함을 지니고 계신 분이셨단다, 그렇게 생각하지 않니 핍?”\\n\\u3000나는 알 수  없었다. 하지만  그렇다(착했을 것 같다)고 말하진  않았다.\\n\\u3000“글쎄!” 조가 자신의 이야기에 점점 더 빠져들며 계속 말을 이어갔다. “누군가는 생계를 꾸려 나가야해, 핍, 그렇지 않으면 생계가 꾸려지지 않으니까, 그렇게 생각하지 않니?”\\n그건 나도 알 수 있는 문제여서 조에게 “그래”라고 대답했다.\\n\\u3000“결국, 아버진 내가 일을 하는 것에 반대하진 않았단다. 그래서 난 지금 이 직업에 종사하게 되었지. 이 일은 아버지의 일이기도 했어, 만약 아버지가 계속 이 일을 이어갔었다면 말이지. 썩 괜찮지는 못했지만 난 정말 웬만큼 열심히 이 일을 해왔단다. 그 사실을 확신하마. 핍. 이윽고 난 아버지를 부양할 수 있었고, 아버지가 ‘몸 전체에 자줏빛을  띠며 극심한 발작’(뇌졸중 발작)을 일으키곤 돌아가실 때까지 나는 그를 돌보아 주었단다. 아버지의 묘비 위에 ‘(1행) 그의 결점이 무엇이든   이 글을 읽는 자여 기억하라, (2행) 그가 자신의 심장 속에 어떤 선함을 지니고 있었음을.’라는 글을 새겨 넣는 것이 내 의도였단다.”\\n\\u3000조는 이 ‘2행의 연구’(한 쌍의 시)를 ‘아주 명백한 자긍심’과 ‘주의깊은 명쾌함’으로 암송했다(보지 않고도 달달 외워 말했다). 그래서 내가 “그 2행을 직접 지었냐고” 물어보았다.\\n\\u3000“그래, 내가 지었어.” 조(주인공의 매형)가 말했다. “나 혼자서 말이지. 순식간에 만들었지. 그건 마치 ‘말굽 하나’를 통째로 한방에 ‘스크라이크 아웃’(완성)시키는 것과 같았어. 지금까지 살아오면서 그때만큼 놀란 적은 없었으니까. 난 내 교육을 신용하지 않는단다. 너에게만 말하마 나는 한 번도 내 교육을 믿은 적이 없었어. 내가 말한 것처럼, 핍 (주인공 꼬마의 이름), 그 시를 내 아버지 묘비에 새기는 것이 내 의도 였단다. 하지만 그러려면 돈이 들어. 네가 그것을 작게 새기든 크게 새 기든 돈이 든단다. 그래서 아무것도 못하고 말았지. 상여꾼(관 옮기는 사람)에게 줄 돈은 둘째 치더라도, 내가 아낄 수 있는 돈은 모두 모아 엄마를 위해 남겨놓아야 했으니까. 엄마는 건강이 안 좋으셨어. 무엇보다 무일푼(돈이 전혀 없음)이셨지. 불쌍한 ‘그녀의 영혼’(엄마)이 뒤를 따라간 것은 그리 오래지 않아서였어. 결국 그렇게나마 그녀 몫의 평온을 누릴 수 있게 된 거지.”\\n\\u3000조의 푸른 두 눈이 약간 물기를 머금기 시작했다. 그가 우선 ‘부지깽이 말단(끝)의 둥근 손잡이’로 한쪽 눈을 닦았다. 그리곤 다른 쪽 눈도 닦았다. 그것도 가장 적합하지 않을 것 같은 방법으로, 그것도 가장 불 편해 보이는 방법으로 그는 부지깽이 손잡이로 자기 눈을 닦았다.\\n\\u3000“그 다음엔 외롭기만 했단다.” 조가 말했다. “여기서 혼자 사는 게 말이야. 그리고 나는 네 누나를 알게  되었지.  지금  이렇게  말이다,  핍.” 조가 단호하게 나를 쳐다보았다. 그건 마치 ‘자기가 지금부터 할 말’에 내가 동의하지 않을 것이라는 사실을 이미 다 알고 있다는 태도 같았다. 조가 계속 말했다. “네 누난  풍채(외모)가  당당한  여성이란다.” (‘주인공 누나’의 체격은 뼈가 앙상하고 매사에 화를 잘 내는 성격임)\\n명백한 의심의 상태에서, 나는 불을 쳐다보지 않을 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000“그 문제에 대해 가족들의 의견이 무엇이든지, 혹은 그 문제에 대한 세상의 평판이 어떻든지 간에  말이다. 핍, 네  누난 말이다,” 조는 한  마디 한 마디 이어갈 때마다 부지깽이로 (벽난로) 맨 위쪽 봉을 톡톡 두드리며 말했다. “풍―채가, 풍―채가 대―단―한 여성이야!”\\n\\u3000“조가 그렇게 생각한다니 난 기뻐.” 나는 이 말밖엔 더 좋은 말이  도저히  생각나지 않았다.\\n\\u3000“나도 기쁘단다.” 조가 내 말을 따라잡으며 말했다. “나는 기쁘단다. 내가 ‘네 누나가 풍채가 대단한 여성’이라고 생각하는 게 말이다, 핍. 여기저기에 약간의 발적(붉게 부어오른 것)이 있고 뼈에 약간의 문제     가 있지만 말이다. 그게 나한테 뭐 문제겠니?”\\n\\u3000나는 영리하게 이렇게 말해주었다. 만약 그것이  그(조)에게 문제가 되지 않는다면 그것이 누구에게 무슨 문제가 되겠냐고?\\n\\u3000“그렇고말고!” 조가 내말에 동의를 표하며  말했다. “바로 그거란다.  네 말이 맞아, 이 친구야! 내가 네 누나를 알았을 때, 그녀가 어린 너를 어떤 식으로 손수 기르고 있었는지가 장안의 화제였단다. 그녀가 마음이 참 착하다고 모든 마을 사람들이 말들 했지. 그래서 나도 마을 사람들을 따라 그녀가 마음씨가 참 곱다고 말했지. 그때 당시의 너(주인공꼬마)로 말할 것 같으면 말이다.” 조는 참말로 아주 불쾌한 무언가 (주인공)를 쳐다보고 있다는 얼굴 표정을 지어며 말했다. 조가 자기 말에 점점 빠져들며 말했다. “만약 네(주인공꼬마)가 그때 당시 얼마나 조그맣고 얼마나 무기력하고 얼마나 몸이 좋지 않은 아기였는지를 알  수 있다면, 넌 아마 네 자신에 대해 이 세상에서 가장 경멸을 받을 만한 의견을 제시할  텐데.”\\n\\u3000그 얘기가 그다지 즐겁게만  들리지  않았던  내가  말했다.  “난 상관 안 해(별로 신경 쓰지 않아), 조.” (‘조’는 매형의 이름, 핍은 주인공의 이름)\\n\\u3000“하지만 난 너를 염두에 두고 있었단다, 핍.” 조가 다정하고 순박한 표정을 지어보이며 말을 했다. “내가 네 누나에게 교제를 제시하고 그녀가 기꺼이 그리고 대장장이의 아내가 될 준비가 되었을 때 교회에 가자(결혼식)고 제안했을 때, 난 그녀에게 네 얘기도 했었단다. ‘그 여리고 볼품없는 어린아이도 함께 데려오우. 하늘이 우리에게 축복으로 내리신 그 여리고 볼품없는 어린아이를 말이오.’라고 말했지. 나는 또 그녀에게 이렇게 말했단다. ‘대장간에는 그 아이가 들어올 자리가 있다 오.’라고.”\\n\\u3000나는 와락 울음을  터뜨리며 용서를  빌기 시작했다. 내가 조의  목을   꼭 껴안았다. 조가 나를 앉으려다 부지깽이를 떨어뜨리고 말았다. 조가\\n말했다. “우린 영원토록 최고의 친구가 될 거야, 그렇지 않니, 핍. 울      지 말거라, 이  친구야!”\\n\\u3000이 작은 휴지기간(서로 부둥켜안고 울음)이 끝났을 때, 조(주인공의 매형)가 새삼 말했다. (소설 속에서 조는 착하지만 많이 우둔한 어른 임)\\n\\u3000“그런데, 보자구나, 핍(주인공이름), 우리가 지금 여기에 있지 않니! 그것이 어딜 밝혀주고 있느냐 하는 얘기야. 우리가 여기 있으니까! 자, 이제 네가 내 공부를 시작했다고 치자 핍, 그 전에 이 얘기부터 미리 해야겠구나, 나는 끔찍하게 우둔하단다. 이 세상에서 가장 끔찍하게 우둔하지. ‘조 부인’(주인공의 누나)이 우리가 시작한 이 공부에 대해 지나치게 많이 알아서는 절대 안 돼. 다시 말해서, 핍, 우린 이 공부를 몰래해야 한단다. 왜 몰래 해야 하냐고? 그 이유를 들려주마. 핍.”\\n\\u3000그(조)가 부지깽이를 다시 집어 들었다. 부지깽이 없이도 그가 논증을 지속할 수 있었을 지 의문이다.\\n“네 누난 곧잘 정부(지배)를 해.”\\n\\u3000“누나가 정부(국가기관)에게 넘어갔다고(주어졌다고), 조?”  내가 깜짝 놀라 말했다. 왜냐하면 ‘어슴푸레한 생각’ 하나가 들었기 때문이다. 이런 말하면 안 되지만 굳이 덧붙이자면 ‘희망’ 같은 것이 나에게도 보였기 때문이다.(누나가 주인공을 때리면서 키웠기 때문에 주인공은 누 나를 싫어함) 그래서 내 생각에 혹시 조(매형)가 ‘해군 본부 위원’이나 ‘재무부 위원’의 은덕을 입어 누나와 이혼했다는 말인 줄 알았다.\\n\\u3000“곧잘 정부(지배)를 해.” 조가 말했다. “정확하게 말하면 너와 나에 대한  정부(지배) 말이야.”\\n“오호~!  그 정부(지배).”\\n\\u3000“그리고 누난 집에 학자를 들이는 것을  썩 좋아하지 않는단다.” 조가  계속  이어갔다. “특히  내(조)가 학자가  되는 것을 아주 썩  정말 썩 좋아하지 않을 거야. 내가 들고 일어날 수도 있기 때문에 두려운 거지. 일종의 반역자처럼 말이야.  모르겠니?”\\n\\u3000내가 질문 하나를  던져 그의  말에 반박할 생각이었다. 그래서  내가   막 “왜―”라고까지 말을 했을 때 조가 내 말을 끊으며 먼저 말했다.\\n\\u3000“잠깐만 기다려봐. 핍, 네가 무슨 말을  하려는지 알겠거든. 잠깐만 아주 잠깐만 가만\\t있어봐!  나도\\t네\\t누나가 가끔\\t우리들에게  ‘무굴 인’(16세기~19세기 인도를 지배한 이슬람인들, 소설 속에선 폭군이란 의미)처럼 행동하려든다는 사실을 부정하진 않는단다. 네 누나가 우릴 뒤로 메쳐 나가떨어지게 한 후 무겁게 내리누르곤 한다는 사실을 부정 하진 않는단다. 네 누나가 미쳐 날뛰는 그런 때는 더더욱 말이다, 핍.” 조가 문 쪽을 힐끗 쳐다본 후 목소리까지 죽이며 이렇게 소곤거렸다. “그럴 땐 솔직히 그녀가 ‘파괴자’라는 것을 인정하지 않을 수 없단다.” 조는 그 단어(파괴자)를 또박또박 말했기 때문에 마치 그 단어(파괴\\n자)가 적어도 12개의 ‘ㅍ’자로 시작하는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000“왜 내가 들고일어나면 안 되냐고? 그게 네 의견(논평)이지. 네가 내 말을 끊었을 때 말이다, 핍, 그렇지 않니?”\\n“맞아, 조.”\\n\\u3000“글쎄다,” 조가 오른손에 쥐고 있던 부지깽이를 왼손으로 바꿔 쥐며 말했다. 아마도 오른손가락으로 자신의 구레나룻(수염)을 만 지르는 듯 보였다. 사실 나는 알고 있었다. 그가 그렇게 ‘조용한 심심풀이’(손가락으로 구레나룻 만지기)에 빠져들 땐 그에게서 희망을 걸 수 없다는 사 실을 말이다. “네 누난 말이다. 지휘자란다.  암(그럼),  지휘자이고말고.”\\n\\u3000“그게 뭔데?” 나는 그를 궁지에 몰아넣을 수도 있겠다는 약간의 희망을 안고 그렇게 질문한 것이었다. 하지만 조는 내 기대와 다르게 자신이 사용한 단어에 대한 정의를 내릴 준비가 이미 되어 있었다. 그리고 순환논법을 사용해 나를 완전히 좌절시키고 말았다. 그가 내게 시선을 고정시킨 채 이렇게 대답했기 때문이다. “네 누나지.”\\n\\u3000“그리고 나는 지휘자가 아니란다.” 조(주인공의 매형)가 내게서 시선을 풀고 손가락으로 구레나룻을 꼼지락거리며 다시 말하기 시작했다. 물론 소곤거리면서 말이다. 조가 말했다. “그리고 최후에는, 핍, 나는 이 얘기를 아주 심각하게 네게 들려주고 싶구나, 이 친구야. 난 불쌍하고 가엾은 엄마의 모습을 어릴 적부터 너무 많이 보며자랐단다. 그녀는 널 힘들고  단조롭고  노예처럼  혹사당했어.  그녀의  정직한  영혼은 널 짓밟혀야했어. 인간으로서의 생애동안 단 한 번도 평화가 그녀에게 찾아온 적은 없었단다. 그래서 난 여성에게 올바른 행동을 하지 않는 방식으로 잘못을 행하는 것을 끔찍이도 두려워하게 되었단다. 그리고 다른 방식으로 잘못을 하는 것이 둘 중 훨씬 더 낫겠다고 생각했지. 다른 방식이란 나를 좀 불편하게 만드는 것이었어. 불편해지는 게 나 혼자이길 바랬는데, 핍. 회초리가 너를 때리지 않기를 바랐단다, 이 친 구야. 너 대신 내가 그 회초리들을 다 맞을 수만 있다면 하구 말이지. 하지만 이것이 또 회초리에 담긴 의미 아니겠니. 위로 가고  아래로  가고 똑바로 가고 하면서 말이다, 핍. 네가 잘못된 것들을 못 본 체하길 바라.”\\n\\u3000그때 난 아직 어렸다. 하지만 내가 조를 다시 바라보게 되고 그의 인성에 감탄하게 된 것은 그 날 밤부터였다. 우리는 나중에도, 그 이전   에 그랬던 것처럼, 서로가 서로에게 대등한 존재였다(‘어리숙한 매형’ 과 주인공은 부담 없이 반말하는 사이였다). 하지만 이후 조용한 때 내가 조를 바라보며 앉아 그의 인성에 대해 다시 생각해볼 때면, 나는 내 마음 깊숙한 곳에서부터 그에 대한 존경심이 다시 솟아나는 것을 새롭게 자각(의식)할 수 있었다. 그건 매번 새로운 느낌이었다.\\n\\u3000“그건 그렇고,” 조가 난로에 석탄을 좀 더 넣으려고 일어서며 말했다. “여기  ‘네덜란드 시계’(서양영화에서 자주 보이는 벽시계)가 8시를 칠 수 있을 때까지 새빠지게 돌아가고  있구먼, 네 누난 왜 아직도 집에 돌아오지 않는 거냐! ‘펌블추크 삼촌’(능글맞은  잡곡상)의  암말이 얼음 조각 위에 발을 잘못 놓다 넘어진 건 아닌지 걱정이네.”\\n\\u3000‘조 부인’(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)은 장이 서는 날이면 펌블추크 삼촌이란 이따금씩 여행을 다녀오곤 했다. 펌블추크 씨가 집에 쓸 물 건이나 상품들을 사려갈 때가 있었는데 그럴 때면 여성의 안목이 필요 했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 삼촌은 미혼이었다(결혼 안함). 그리고 자기 집 하인들에겐 전혀 희망(신뢰)를 걸지 않았다. 이런 저런 이유들과 그 날이 마침 장이 서는 날이라는 사실이 조 부인의 이러한 짧은 외출의 사유들 중 하 나였다.\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형)는 난로 불을 살려놓곤 주변 바닥을 쓸었다. 그런 다음 우리는 문으로 나아가서 ‘2륜 경마차’(바퀴 두 개) 소리가 들리는지 귀를 기울여보았다. 그 날은 건조하고 추운 어느 날 밤이었다. 바람이 날카롭게 불고 있었고, 오늘 내린 하얀 서리는 단단해져 있었다. 만약 이런 날씨에 늪지대 위에 누워있었다면 죽었을 것이다, 오늘 밤에 말이다. 물론 그건 내  생각이었다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 난 별들을 올려다보았다. 만약 추위에 지쳐 죽어가던 ‘사 나이’(소설 앞부분에 나왔던 죄수)가 마침 밤하늘로 얼굴을 돌렸을 때 이토록 화려하게 반짝거리는 이 수많은 대중(별)들 속에서 어떠한 희망도 어떠한 동정도 발견하지 못한다면 이 얼마나 끔직한 일일까를 생 각하며 난 밤하늘의 별들을 올려다보았다.\\n\\n\\u3000 “저기 암말(마차)이 오고 있구나.”라며 조(주인공의 매형)가 말했다. “그 참 발걸음 한번 종소리처럼 힘차고 분명하네!”\\n\\u3000암말의 발굽에 받힌 ‘쇠’가 딱딱한 ‘도로’와 맞닿으며 소리를 내고 있었다. 꼭 뮤지컬 같았다. 평소보다 훨씬 활기차고 빠른 걸음으로 오고 있었다. 우리는 ‘조 부인’(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)이 디딜 의자를 밖에 내놓았다. 밝은 창문을 만들기 위해 난로불도 확 휘저었다. 모든 부엌 물건들이 제자리에 놓여있는지도 최종 점검했다.\\n\\u3000우리가 조 부인을 맞이하기 위한 이 모든 준비를 마무리했을 때, 그들이 말을 멈추었다. 무엇 때문인지 그들의 눈은 매우 기뻐하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000곧 조 부인이 마차(바퀴 2개인 마차)에서 내렸다. 그녀를 따라 펌블추크 삼촌도 내렸다. 펌블추크 삼촌이 천으로 암말을 덮어주었다. 우리 모두 부엌으로 들어갔다. 우리를 따라 들어간 바깥 공기가 어찌나 차가웠던지 난로 열기가 다 달아난 것만 같았다(추웠다).\\n\\u3000“자,” 조 부인이 황급히 보닛(턱 밑에 모자 끈을 묶던 모자)을 재끼며 흥분해선 말했다. 그녀는 보닛을 어깨 뒤로 확 재끼려다 끈이 어깨에 걸리고 말았다. “만약 이 녀석이 오늘 밤 기뻐하지 않는다면 저 녀석이 과연 언제  기뻐할까!”\\n\\u3000나는 왜 그런 표현을 내가 떠맡아야 하는지도 전혀 모르는 채, 한 소년이 지어보일 수 있는 가능한 최대한의 감사함을 얼굴가득 지어보 였다.\\n\\u3000“단지 내가 바라는 건,” 누나가 말했다. “저 녀석이 게으름을 피워 손해를 끼치지나 않을까 하는 건데. 아무래도 그럴 것 같지만.”\\n\\u3000“그녀는 그리 호락호락한 사람이 아닙니다, 부인.” 펌블추크 삼촌(능 글맞은 잡곡상)이 말했다. “부인이 잘 아시잖아요.”\\n\\u3000그녀라니? 내가 조(주인공의 매형)를 바라보며 입 모양과 눈썹 모양으로 “그녀라니?”라고 물어보았다. 근데 조도 역시 나를 바라보며 “그 녀라니?”라고 입 모양과 눈썹 모양으로 묻고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“그녀가 누구냐고?” 누나가 조의 표정에서 조가 하려던 말을 캐치하며 말했다. 그러자 조가 손등으로 코를 쓱 문지르면서 누나를 쳐다보았다. 그건 그런 경우 누나를 달래려고 그가 자주 하는 행동이었다.\\n\\u3000“그런데?” 누나가 딱딱거리며 물듯이 다시 말했다. “뭘 빤히 바라보고 있는 거야? 집에 불이라도 났다는 거야 응?”\\n\\u3000“―어떤 개인이,” 조가 공손하게 그리고 넌지시 힌트를 주며 말했다. “말하는 것 같았는데 ―  그녀라고.”\\n\\u3000“그래 그녀가 그녀지 그럼 누구겠어, 응?” 누나가 또 닦달을 하며 말했다. “만약 당신이 ‘미스 해비샴’(여자주연, 여자주인공은 아니고 여자주연)을 ‘그’라고 부르지만 않는다면 말이지. 아니지 당신이라면 충분히 그녀를 그라고 부르고도  남지.”\\n“미스  해비샴이라니?  읍 외곽에  사는  그  해비샴?”  조가  말했다. “그럼 읍내에 또 다른 미스 해비샴이 있냐? 이 얼간아?” 누나가 거\\n칠게 되받아쳤다.\\n\\u3000“그녀(미스 해비샴)가 이 꼬마 녀석이 자기 집에 와서 놀아주길 바라. 그리고 이애는 당연히 거길 갈 것이고. 그리고  이 녀석도  거기서  노는 것이 더 좋을 거고(꼭 가야한다는 의미).” 누나가 정말로 밝고 명량 하라는 격려의 표시로 내게 고개를 흔들어 보이며 말했다. “안 그 랬다가는 내가 저 녀석을 부려먹을 테니까.”\\n\\u3000읍 외곽에 산다는 미스 해비샴에 대한 소문은 나도 익히 들어본 적이 있었다. 주변 수 킬로미터 내에 사는 사람이라면 누구나 읍 외곽에 산다는 미스 해비샴에 대한 소문을 들어보았을 것이다. 어마어마하게 부자이고 무시무시한 귀부인이라는 소리를. 그녀는 크고 음침한 집에서 살고 있었고 도둑들을 막기 위해 집 둘레에 높은 방어울타리(벽)를 쳐놓고서 그 안에서 철저히 격리된 삶을 살고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“그럼 틀림없구나!” 조가 몹시 놀라며 말했다. “그녀가 핍(주인공이름, 아직은 꼬마)을 어떻게  알았을까!”\\n\\u3000“이 등신아!” 누나가 고함을 질렀다. “그녀가 이 녀석을 안다고 누가 말했어?”\\n\\u3000“―어떤 개인이,” 조가 공손하게 그리고 힌트를 주면서 다시 말했다. “말하는 것 같았는데 ― 그녀가 이 얘(주인공꼬마)가 자기 집에 와서 놀아주기를 원한다고.”\\n\\u3000(주인공 누나의 긴 대사임→) “그럼 그녀(미스 해비샴, 여자주연)가 펌블추크 삼촌(능글맞은 잡곡상)에게 ‘혹시 자기 집에 와 놀아줄 꼬마 하나 아는지?’ 어떤지를 물을 수도 없었다는 얘기에요? 펌블추크 삼촌   이 그녀의 임차인(집 빌린 사람)일 수 있는 가능성이 만에 하나라도 없었다는 거예요? 그리고 삼촌이 이따금씩 임대료(월세)를 내러 그 집에 들를 일이 없었다는 거예요? 그 임대료가 분기마다인지 혹은 반년 마다인지 당신 같은 작자가 그 어려운 걸 어찌 알겠어. 그리고 펌블추    크 삼촌이 늘 우리 일을 신경써주시고 친절을 베풀어주셨던 지라, 그래 당신 같은 작자에게 그런 질문이 주어졌다면 감히 생각도 못했겠지,  이 요셉아.”\\n\\u3000누나는 그(조)가 이 세상에서  가장  무감각한  조카인양 힐난(비난)하 는 어조로 말했다.(조는 ‘펌블추크 삼촌의 실제  조카’이다)  “그때 이 꼬마 녀석을 말씀드린 거지. 지금 여기서 껑충거리며 뛰어다니고 있는 이 꼬마 녀석을 말이지.” 지금 이 자리에서 가장 엄숙하게 선언하건데 난 그때 껑충거리며 뛰어다니고 있지 않았다. 가만있었다. 누나가 계속 말했다. “내가 자진해서 이 노예 노릇을 평생 해주고 있는 이 녀석을 말이에요.”\\n\\u3000“언변이 판타스틱 하십니다, 부인!” 펌블추크 삼촌이 끼어들었다. “아주, 아주 훌륭하십니다! 핵심을 꼭 집어셨어요, 꼭요! 정말 잘 맞추 셨어요! 자 요셉(주인공의 매형이름), 너도 뭐가 뭔지 알았겠지.”\\n\\u3000“아니에요, 요셉은 몰라요.” 누나가 여전히 힐난(비난)하는 어조로 조에게 말했다. 조는 자기 손등을 코에 쓱 문지르고 다시 또 쓱 문지르며 자기 딴에는 용서를 구하고 있었다. 누나가 말했다. “당신(조)은 아직도 이 상황을 이해 못하고 있어. 그렇지만 당신은 속으로 자신이 이 상황을 이해한다고 생각하겠지. 이 상황이 어떤 상황인지 말이야. 당신이 이 상황을 알고 있다고 생각할 수도 있어, 하지만 당신이 정말 모르는 것이 있어, 요셉. 왜냐하면 당신은 이걸 모를 것이기 때문이야. 미스 해비샴의 집에 가는 것이 이 꼬마 녀석의 운명에 어떤 영향을 끼 칠지도 모른다는 것을 감지하신 ‘펌블추크 삼촌’께서, 이 녀석을 오늘 밤 삼촌의 2륜 경마차(바퀴 두 개)에 태워  읍내로 데리고 가 하루 밤을 재워준 후 이 녀석을 손수 데리고 내일 아침에 미스 해비샴의 집에 들르실 것이기 때문이야. 오! 이런 맙소사!”\\n\\u3000누나가 절망에 빠진 표정을 지어보이며 자신의 어깨에 걸려 있던 ‘보닛’(모자, 끈이 턱 밑까지 오는 여성용 모자)의 끈을 풀어 내던지며 외쳐댔다. “내가 지금 여기서 이런 바보 얼간이들이랑 노닥거리고 있을 때가 아니지. 펌블추크 삼촌이 기다리시는데 말이야. 암말(삼촌의 마차를 끄는 암말)이 문밖에서 저렇게 추위에 떨고 있는데 말이지. 그리고 이 녀석은 왜 이렇게 때가져선 온통 검댕이야. 머리카락에서 발바닥까지 어찌나 오물투승이인지!”\\n\\u3000누나의 그 말(이 녀석 왜 이렇게 때가 많아)과 함께, 누나(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)는 마치 독수리가 새끼 양을 낚아채듯이 내 허리를 낚아채서는 세면대에 있는 나무대야(세수 대야)에 내 얼굴을 꽉꽉 눌러 집어넣었다. 그리고 내 머리를 ‘빗물 받는 통’의 꼭지(수도꼭지) 아 래로 밀어넣은 후 비누질을 시작했으며 이후 나는 주무르고 반죽하고 타월로 휘감고 내 등을 탁탁 사정없이 때리면서 나를 불안으로 짓눌렀으며 내 귀에 거슬리는 온갖 말들을 다 널어놓은 후, 정말이지 내가  정신이 나가기 일보직전일 때 씻기를 마쳤다.\\n\\u3000내가 여기서 논평하건대, “결혼반지가 인간의 얼굴 위에 사정없이 문질러질 때, 그 결혼반지의 툭 튀어나온 부분의 영향이 인간의 얼굴에 어떤 아픔을 주는지 만큼은 이 분야(반지의 영향)의 어떤 권위자들 보다 내가 훨씬 더 잘 알고 있을 것이다.” 적어도 나는 그렇게 생각한다.\\n\\u3000내 씻음이 완전히 끝났을 때, 누나는 나에게, 어린 참회자가 삼베옷 (삼베옷은 참배의 표시임)을 입듯이, 가장 뻑뻑한 느낌이 나는 깨끗한 속옷을 입혔다. 그리고 가장 꽉 조이고 가장 끔찍한 옷을 입혀 나를  옷 속에 단단히 묶은 후, 누나는 나를 펌블추크 삼촌(능청맞은 잡곡상, 주인공의 진짜 삼촌은 아님, 그냥 말로만 삼촌)에게 인도했다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 삼촌은 자기가 마치 사법장관이라도 된 마냥 한껏 격식을 차리며 나를 인계받은 후, 내가 이미 눈치 챘듯이, 내 씻음이 계속되는 동안 말하지 못해 안달이 난 일장연설을 내 얼굴 위로 쏟아 붓기 시작 했다. 펌블추크 삼촌이 말했다. “소년아, 너의 모든 친구들(신분상승에의 기회를 준 가족과 삼촌)에게 영원히 감사해 하거라, 특히 너를 손수 길러준 그들에겐 더더욱 감사해  하거라.”라고.\\n“굿 바이, 조!” (조는 ‘주인공의 매형’) “너에게 행운이 깃들길, 핍, 이 친구야!”\\n\\u3000나는 한 번도 조와 떨어져본 적이 없었었다. 그런 내 감정들과 내  얼굴에 붙은 비누 거품들로 인해 처음엔 2륜 경마차 말곤 아무것도 보 이지 않았다. 좀 전 까지만 해도 그렇게 많이도 보이던 별도 보이지 않았다. 하지만 시간이 지나면서 별이 하나씩 하나씩 반짝반짝 빛나기 시작했다. 하지만 어떠한 별도 내 질문에는 빛을 주지 않고 있었다.\\n\\u3000‘도대체 내가 왜 미스 해비샴(귀부인, 여자주연, 여자주인공은 아니고 여자주연)의 집에 놀러가야 하지? 내가 거길 가서 도대체 무얼 하며 놀아야 되지?’라는 내 질문 말이다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 8장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨(능청맞은 잡곡상, 쌀 이외의 곡식을 사고파는 상인)의 점포(점포와 집)는 ‘장이 서는 읍’의 중심가에 있었다. ‘잡곡상과 씨앗 장수’의 점포답게, ‘말린 후추열매’와 ‘곡식 가루’ 같은 특징을 지닌 집 이었다. 내가 보기에 이 위인은 정말 아주 행복한 사람인 것 같았다. 가게에 아주 작은 서랍들이 무수히 많이 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000나는 아래쪽 단에 있는 한 두 개의 서랍 안을 훔쳐볼 기회가 있었는데, 서랍 안에는 단단히 묶인 갈색 종이 다발들이 많이 보였다. 나는 궁금했다. 꽃씨들과 ‘구근’(둥근 뿌리와 줄기)들이 이러한 구치소에서 벗어나 만개(꽃이 피다)할 수 있는 화창한 날씨를 한번이라도 원하지 않았을까  하고 말이다.\\n\\u3000내가 이런 사색(‘꽃씨야  탈출해  어서’라는  사색)을  즐긴  것은 내가 그 점포에 도착한 다음 날 이른 아침이었다. 전날 밤에는 경사진 지붕 아래에 있는 다락방의 침대로 직행해야했는데, 침대 틀(뼈대)이 있는 구석이 어찌나 낮은지 나는 내 눈썹과 30cm 이내에 있을 기와들의 수를  추산(계산)해보기까지 했었다.\\n\\u3000내가 ‘씨앗들’과 ‘골덴바지’(코르덴 바지, 보온성은 있지만 디자인은 최악인 바지, 위에서 아래로 줄이 가 있는 바지) 이 둘 사이에 정말이지 환상적인 찰떡궁합이 있다는 사실을 발견한 것도 이 날 이른 아침 이었다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨는 골덴바지를 입고 있었다,  가게점원도 역시  골덴바지를 입고 있었다. 뭐 어쨌든지 간에, “골덴 바지가 풍기는 향기와 전반적인 분위기”가 씨앗의 특성에도 아주 많이 담겨 있었다. 그리고 “씨앗이 풍기는 향기와 전반적인 분위기”가 골덴바지의 특성에도 아주 많이 담겨 있었다. 이제 보니 어느 게 어느 건지 구분할 수도 없을 정도였다.(점포 내에 있는 골덴바지와 씨앗이 헷갈렸다)\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨는 길 건너 ‘마구(승마 기구) 판매상’을 건너다보는 것으 로써(자기 일은 안하고) 자신의 업무를 수행하는 것 같았다. 그 사실을 알아챌 호기가 내게 주어진 것이다. 그러고 보니 그 ‘마구 판매상’ 역시 ‘마차  제조인’에게서 눈을 고정시키는 것으로써 자신의 일을 수행하는 것 같았고, 그 ‘마차 제조인’ 역시 양쪽 호주머니에 자신의 두 손을 푹 집어넣은 채 제빵업자를 응시하는 것으로 자신의 일을 대신하고 있는 것 같았다. 그리고 그 ‘제빵업자’ 역시 양팔을 순서대로 포개가며 ‘식료 잡화상인’을 째려보고 있었고 그 ‘식료 잡화상인’ 역시 자기 일은 안하고 가게 문에 서서 ‘약사’에게 시선을 고정시킨 채 하품을 크게 하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000‘시계 제조인’이 자기 눈에 돋보기를 끼고서 조그만 책상 위를 계속해서 세세히 보고 있었다. 시계 제조인 쇼윈도 유리를 통해 작업복을 입은 한 무리의 사람들이 안을 살펴보고 있었다. 이 ‘시계 제조인’만이 이 읍 중심가에서 자기 직업에 열중하고 있는 거의 유일한 사람인 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨와 난 가게 뒤 칸에 있는 응접실에서 8시에 아침을 먹었다. 그 동안 가게점원은 ‘차 한 잔’과 ‘버터 바른 빵’ 한 덩어리를 완두콩 자루에 담아와 점포에서 먹었다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨와 함께 식사를 하는 것은 끔찍했다. 게다가 그는 내 누나와 같은 생각에 사로잡혀 있었다. 즉 내(주인공꼬마) 식단에 올라오는 모든 음식들은 굴욕적이고 속죄의 경향을 띄어야한다는 것 말이다. 이것만이 아니었다. 그는 내게 가능한 한 버터를 적게 바른 빵 부스러기만을 왕창 주었을 뿐만 아니라, 우유에 따뜻한 물을 아주 그냥 쏟아 부은 후 내게 마시라고 주었다. 물에 우유를 너무 많이 타서 차라리 거기서 우유를  빼버리는 것이 훨씬 더 솔직해 보일 정도였다. 그의 대화는 몽땅 산수얘기뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000내가 공손하게 “좋은 아침이에요.”라는 인사를 건네자마자, 그가 신 속하게 이렇게 물었다. “7×9=? 응, 꼬마야?” 그런 낮선 장소에서 그것도 속(배)이 텅 빈 상태에서 그딴 식으로 혀를 찔리고 나면 내가 도  대체 어떻게 대답을 할 수 있겠는가! 나는 배고프다고 이 인간아.\\n\\u3000내가 한 입 삼키자마자 그 인간은 또 내게 합계를 묻어왔고 그런 식의 질문들이 아침식사 내내 지속되었다.\\n\\u3000“더하기 7은?” “거기에 또 4를 더하면?” “거기에 8을 더하면?” “그리고 6을 더하면?” “그리고 2를 더하면?” “그리고 또 10을 더하면?” 등등의  질문들이 계속되었다.\\n\\u3000각각의 숫자들을  해치운(답변한)  후 또 다른 질문이 주어지기 전에,  난 가능한 한 많이 한  입 베어  물거나  한 잔 홀짝 마셨다. 그동안 그는 아무것도 알아맞힐 필요 없이 편안하게 앉아선 베이컨(소금에 절인 돼지고기 불에 그슬린 후 삶아 말린 것)과 따끈따끈한 둥근 빵을, 내게도 이런 표현을 하는 게 허락된다면, 거의 구역질이 날 정도로 게걸스 럽게  먹어대고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그런 이유들로 해서, 벽시계가 10시를 치고 우리가 ‘미스 해비샴의 집’으로 갈 시간이 되었을 때 난 너무  기뻤다. 그렇지만  그  귀부인의 지붕 아래에서 내가 과연 어떤 식으로 처신해야하는 지에 관해서는 내 마음이 전혀 편치  않았다.\\n\\u300015분도 안 되어 우리는 ‘미스 해비샴의 집’에 도착할 수 있었다. 음 침하고 오래된 벽돌집이었다. 집 곳곳에 쇠창살이 아주 많이 달려 있었다. 창문들 중 일부는 아예 안에서부터 벽돌로 막혀있었다. 그리고 멀쩡한 창문으로 남아 있는 창문들 중에서도 아래쪽 창문들은 몽땅 녹슨 창살(막대기)로 보호되고  있었다.\\n건물 앞 쪽에 안뜰이 있었다. 물론 안뜰에도 창살(막대기)은 있었다. 벨이 울린 후 누군가가 문을 열어주기 위해 올 때까지 우린 그 창살\\n바깥에서 기다려야했다.\\n\\u3000우리가 문에서 기다리는 동안 나는 안을 힐끔 훔쳐보았다. 이  판국에도 이 인간은 내게 “그리고 14를 또 더하면?”이라며 산수계산을 요구하고 있었다. 나는 너무 화가 나 아예 들은 체도 하지 않고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 다시 안을 힐끔 쳐다보니 집 옆쪽에 큰 양조장(술 만들어 도매 하는 집)이 하나 딸려 있는 게 보였다. 하지만 더 이상 술을 만들지 않는 양조장 같았다. 오랫동안 사람이 다녀가지 않은 양조장 같이 보였다.\\n\\u3000창문 하나가 들어 올려졌다. 곧 맑은 목소리가 들려왔다. “이름이 뭐 예요?”\\n내 안내자가 대답했다. “펌블추크입니다.” 답변이  돌아왔다. “좋아요.”\\n그리곤 창문이 도로 닫혔다. 곧 이어 ‘어린 아가씨 하나’가 뜰(건물로 둘러싸인 뜰)을 가로질러 우리에게 걸어오고 있었다. 그녀의 손에는 많은 열쇠들이 들려 있었다.\\n\\u3000“이 애가,” 펌블추크 씨가 말했다. “핍(주인공이름, 아직은 꼬마)입니다.”\\n\\u3000“이 애가 핍이라고요?” 아주 예쁘고 정말 거만해 보이는 어린 아가 씨(꼬마 숙녀)가 대답했다. “들어와,  핍.”\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨도 따라 들어가려다 그녀가 문에서 제지하며 바람에 멈추었다. 그녀가 말했다. “어! 아저씨도 미스 해비샴을 만나시려고요?”\\n\\u3000“만약 미스 해비샴께서 저를 뵙기를 원하신 다면요.” 펌블추크 씨가 그녀의 태도에 무척 당황하며  말했다.\\n\\u3000“아!” 그 소녀가 말했다. “하지만 당신은 그녀를 뵐 수 없어요. 잘 아시잖아요.”\\n\\u3000그녀가 너무나 확고하고 당돌하게 최후통첩(뵐 수 없다)을 했기 때문에 펌블추크 씨는 품위를 꾸기고 말았지만 상황이 상황인지라 아무런 방어도 하지  못했다.\\n\\u3000그는 대신 내게만은  엄한  눈짓을  지어보였는데,  내가  마치  그에게 그 짓(무례한 답변)을 했다는 식이었다. 나무라는 투로 이런 말들을 남 기며 그가 떠나갔다. “소년아!  여기에서의 네 행동이 ‘너를 손수 길러준 사람들’에게 명망(신용)이 되게 행동해야 하느니라.”\\n\\u3000나는 그가 다시 돌아와 문을 사이에 두고서 “그리고 16을 또 더하 면?”이라고 묻지나 않을까 하는 염려를 떨쳐버리지 못했다. 그러나 그는  돌아오지 않았다.\\n\\u3000내 어린 여자안내원이 문을 잠갔다. 우리는 뜰(건물로 둘러싸인 뜰)을 가로질러 갔다. 뜰은 포장되어 있었고 깨끗했다. 하지만 갈라진 틈 사이로 잔디가 무성하게 자라고 있었다.\\n뜰에는, 양조장 건물로 통하는 작고 좁은 길이 하나 있었다. 그 좁은 길의 나무문들이 열려 있었다. 그 문들 너머로 ‘양조장 전제 풍경’이   ‘높게 쳐진 벽들 쪽’까지 환히 보였다. 양조장 전체는 텅 비워 있었다. 오랫동안 사용되지 않은 것  같았다.\\n\\u3000차가운  바람이  ‘이쪽 문 바깥’에서보다 ‘저쪽 안쪽’에서 더 춥게 부는 것만 같았다. 그 바람이 ‘양조장의 터인(열린) 쪽’을 들어가고 나오며 “청승맞게 길게 짖는 것 같은 높고 날카로운 소음”을 만들어내고 있었다. 그 소리는 마치 바다에 있는 ‘배의 삭구’(배에서 쓰는 밧줄과 쇠사슬)에서 나는 바람 소리  같았다.\\n\\u3000내가 양조장(술 만들어 도매하는 집)을 바라보고 있는 모습을 보고 그녀가 이렇게 말했다. “저기서 만들어진 진한 맥주는 지금도 다치지 않고 마실 수 있단다, 이 꼬마야.”\\n\\u3000“제가 생각해도 마실 수 있을 것 같아요, 아가씨.” 내가 수줍어하며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“하지만 지금 저기서 맥주를 만들지 않는 게 더 좋을 걸, 그랬다가는 식초인 걸로 판명날 거니까, 이 꼬마야. 넌 그렇게 생각하지 않니?”\\n“예 그런 것 같아요, 아가씨.”\\n\\u3000“그렇다고 어느 누군가가 벌써 시도해봤다는 건 아니야,” 그녀가 덧붙였다. “양조장은 벌써 완전히 문 닫았으니까, 저건 이제 무너질 때까지 저렇게 한가롭게 저기에 서있을 거니까. 진한 맥주라면 이제 지하 실창고에도 얼마든지 있으니까. 이 ‘매너 하우스’(대저택)를 익사시킬 정도로 많아.”\\n“그게 이 집의 이름인가요, 아가씨?”\\n“이 집의 수많은 이름들 중 하나야, 이 꼬마야.”\\n“그럼 이 집의 이름이 하나 이상이라는 건가요, 아가씨?”\\n\\u3000“하나 이상이지. 이 집의 또 다른 명칭은 ‘새티스’야. 아마 그건 그 리스어이거나, 라틴어(고대 로마제국 행정언어)이거나, 혹은 히브리어 (유대어)일수도 있어. 아니면 그 셋 다 일수도 있고. 뭐 나야 아무래도 좋지만. ‘새티스’란 ‘모든 게 충분하다’는 의미야.”\\n“충분한 집이군요,” 내가 말했다. “참 특이한 이름이네요, 아가씨.” “그래.”  그녀가  대답했다.  “하지만  그  이름(새티스)에는 충분하다는\\n의미 이상의 의미가 있어. 그 이름이 이 집에 주어졌을 당시에만 하더라도 이 집을 소유한 사람은 어느 누구든 더 이상 필요한 것이 없었다는 의미였데. 그 당시 사람들은 쉽게 만족했나봐, 내 생각엔 그래. 자, 늑장부리지마, 꼬마야.”\\n\\u3000비록 그녀가 칭찬과는 거리가 멀고 부주의하게 나를 “꼬마”라고 지 나치게 자주 불렀음에도, 사실 그녀는 대략 내 나이 또래였다. 물론 그녀가 나보다 훨씬 연상으로 보였고, 그거야 소녀니까, 그리고 아름다웠고 침착해보였지만 말이다. 그리고 그녀는 자신이 마치 21살이라도 되는 마냥 나를 멸시했다. 그리고 그녀는 자신이 마치 여왕이라도 되는 마냥  나를 경멸했다.\\n\\u3000우리는 옆문을 통해 집안으로 들어갔다. 정면의 큰 출입구는 바깥쪽 에서 두 개의 쇠사슬이 가로질러 있었다(막혀 있었다). 내가 주목한 첫 번째는 “통로들이 모두 너무 어둡다는 것이고 그래서 그녀가 그곳(통 로)에 불타는 촛불 하나를 놓아두었다”라는 사실이다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 촛불을 집어 들었다. 우리는 여러 통로들을 통과한 후 계단  위로 올라갔다. 여전히 모든 것이 너무나 어두웠다. 다만 우리를 비추고 있는 촛불만은  밝았다.\\n\\u3000우리가 마침내 방문 앞에 도착했다. 그리고 그녀가 말했다. “들어가 봐.”\\n\\u3000내가 예의를 차린 다기 보다는 너무 숫기가 없어(겁이 많아) 이렇게 대답했다. “아가씨가 들어가신  뒤에요.”\\n\\u3000이 말에 그녀가 이렇게 대꾸했다. “웃기는 소리 하지만, 이 꼬마야.  나는 안 들어갈 거란 말이야.” 그녀는 그리곤 나를 경멸하면서 떠나 가버렸다. 더욱이 설상가상으로 그녀가 촛불을 들고 가 버렸다.\\n\\u3000그녀의 이러한 행동은 나는 아주 불유쾌하게 만들었다. 그리고 사실 좀 무서웠다. 하지만 내가 할 수 있는 유일한 일은 그 문을 노크하는 것이었고 나는 노크를 했다. 안에서 들어오라는 말이 들려왔다. 내가 들어갔다. 그리고 나는 내가 아주 예쁘고 넓은 방에 혼자인 것을 발견 했다. 그 방은 밀초(밀랍으로 만든 초, 밀랍은 벌들이 집 만들 때 분비 하는 물질)들로 환하게 밝혀지고 있었다. 방 안에선 햇빛 한 줄 볼 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000가구들로 추측해보건대, 이곳은 (침실 옆에 딸린) 드레싱룸(옷방)이었다. 비록 내겐 너무나도 낮선 형태들과 용도들의 가구가 많았지만 하여튼 드레싱룸이었다. 하지만 그 안에서 “눈에 띈 것”은 천이 느슨하게 씌어져 있고 금박을 입힌 유리가 딸려 있는 “테이블이었다.” 나는 그것이 “귀부인의 화장대”라는 사실을 한눈에 알아볼 수 있었다.\\n\\n\\u3000만약 귀부인이 그 곳(침실 옆에  딸린 드레싱룸)에 앉아 있지 않았어도, 내가 그토록 재빨리 이 물건(유리가 딸린 테이블)의 용도를 알아챌  수 있었을지는 내가 지금 말할 수 없다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 팔꿈치를 테이블 위에 받친 채 자신의 머리로 손 위에 압력을 가하며, 팔걸이의자에 앉아있었다. 내가 지금까지 본 그리고 앞으로 볼 부인들 중 가장 낮선 모습을 한 여인이었다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 공단(무늬가 없는 비단)들과 레이스들과 실크(명주)들로 이루 어진 호화로운 재질들로 만들어진 옷을 입고 있었다. 모두(옷) 다 흰색 이었다. 그녀의 구두들도  흰색이었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 길고 하얀 면사포가 그녀의 머리카락을 의지해 달려 있었다. 그녀의 머리카락에는 부케(신부 꽃)들이 꽂혀 있었다. 그녀의 머리카락 색깔 역시 흰색이었다.\\n\\u3000몇몇 빛나는 ‘보석류들’이 그녀의 목과 두 손 위에서 ‘불꽃을 튀기고 있었다.’ 그리고 또 다른 몇몇 보석류들이 테이블 위에 놓인 채 광채를 띄고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 입고 있던 옷보다 덜 화려한 옷들과 반쯤 짐을 싸다만 트렁 크들이 여기저기 널브러져(흩어져)  있었다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 옷을 완전히 다 입은 상태가 아니었다. 왜냐하면 그녀가 구두 하나를 신고 있지 않았기 때문이다. 그녀가 신지 않은 다른 한 짝 (구두)은 테이블 위 그러니까 그녀의 손 가까이에 놓여 있었다.\\n\\u3000그녀의 면사포는 절반만 걸쳐 있었다. 손목시계도 아직 차지 않은 상태였고 그녀의 가슴에 달 몇몇 레이스(끈)들이 값싼 장신구들과 함께 테이블 위에 놓여 있었다.\\n그리고 그녀의 스카프와, 그리고 장갑들과, 그리고 몇몇 꽃들과, 그\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n리고 기도서(책) 한 권, 이 모두가 (테이블 위에 있는) 거울 주변에 어지럽게 수북이 쌓여  있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 비록 사람들이 처음 몇 순간에 볼 수 있는 것들보다 더 많은 것을 본 것은 맞지만, 내가 이 모든 것들을 처음 몇 순간에 다 본 것은 아니었다. 하지만 내 관점에서 흰색이어야 할 모든 것들이 오래전에는 흰색이었을 테지만 이젠 그 광택을 잃고 색이 바래 노래져 있는  것을  나는 알아보았다.\\n\\u3000“신부 드레스를 입고 있는 신부(귀부인)가”, 드레스처럼 꽃들처럼, 벌써 시들어져 있다는 것을 나는 알아보았다. 어떠한 빛남도 그녀에게 남아 있지 않았다. 단지 그녀의 쑥 들어간 두 눈들만은 아직도 광채를 띄고 있었다.\\n\\u3000젊은 여성의 통통한 몸매에 입혀졌을 그 드레스가,  지금은 비쩍 말라 뼈와 가죽만 남은 몸 위에 걸쳐져 느슨하게 걸려 있다는 사실도 나는 알아보았다.\\n\\u3000언젠가, 나는 박람회장에  따라갔다가  어느  무시무시한  밀랍인형을  본 적이 있었다. 그 인형이 어떤 중요한 인물을 본 딴 인형이었는지는 모르겠지만, 어떤 공적인 인물의 유해를 매장 전에 며칠간 일반인에게 공개하기 위해 만들어진 인형이었던 걸로 기억한다.\\n\\u3000언젠가, 나는 사람들을 따라 오래된 늪지대 교회들에 갔다가 해골을 본 적이 있었다. 교회 바닥에 깔린 널돌 아래로 지하 납골당이 있었는데 그곳에서 파낸 해골이었다. 그 해골은 호화로운 옷 같은 것을 입고 있었지만 모두 잿더미로  변해있었다.\\n\\n\\u3000(해석이 잘 안 돼서, 영어원문에 없는 말을 3개 정도 ‘제 맘대로’ 추 가했습니다. 디킨스도 이해해주지 않을까 싶네요.^^ㅋㅋ 모로 가든 바로 가든 목적지에만 도착하면 되니까. ‘조회 수’도 매일 줄어들고 있는데 잘 하는 짓이다...) \\n “거기 누구냐?” 테이블에 있던 귀부인이 말했다. “핍(주인공이름, 아직은  꼬마)이에요,  마님.” “핍?”\\n\\u3000“펌블추크(능청맞은 잡곡상) 씨가 보낸 소년이요, 마님. 와서 놀라고 하신.”\\n“좀 더 가까이 오거라. 내가 볼 수 있게. 가까이.”\\n\\u3000그녀의 시선을 피한 채 내가 그녀 앞에 섰을 때 나는 주변에 있는 사물들에 대해 상세하게 바라볼 수 있었다. 그녀의 손목시계가 9시 20   분 정각에 멈춘 게 보였다. 방에 있던 벽시계 하나도 9시 20분 정각에 멈춰서 있었다.\\n\\u3000“내 눈을 보거라.” 미스 해비샴이 말했다. “네가 태어난 이래로 태양을 단 한 번도 본 적이 없는 여성이 두렵지 않니?”\\n\\u3000곧 후회했지만, 난  “네,  두렵지  않아요.”라는  대답으로  받아들여질 수 있는 어마어마한 거짓말을  해버렸다.\\n\\u3000“내가 만지고 있는 여기가 무엇인지 아느냐?” 그녀가 두 손을 그녀의 왼쪽에 차례대로 포개며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“예, 마님.” 그녀의 그런 행동은 나로 하여금 내가 예전에 만났던 젊은 남성(주인공의 간을 꺼내 먹겠다고 위협한 탈옥수)을 생각나게 했다.\\n“내가 지금 뭘 만지고 있지?” “마님의  심장이요.” \\n“산산조각  난 심장이지!”\\n\\u3000그녀는 뭔가를 갈망하는 눈빛으로, 강하게 강조하며, 그리고 기묘한 웃음을 지어보이며 그 말을 했다. 그 웃음에는  일종의  자기  자랑 비슷한 것이 들어가 있는 것도 같았다. 이후 그녀는 두 손을 잠시 동안 그 곳(심장)에 그대로 두었다가 천천히 마치 이젠 그 두 손이 무거워졌다    는 마냥 천천히 자기 손들을 치웠다.\\n\\u3000“피곤해.” 미스 해비샴이 말했다. “기분전환이 필요해. 세상 남자 여 자들과는 연분(인연)을 끊었으니까. 자 놀아보거라.”\\n\\u3000가장 논쟁을 좋아하는 독자도 인정하리라 생각한다. 사정이 사정이므로 그녀가 지금 이 불행한 소년이 이 세상에서 행할 수 있는 가장  어려운 일을 지시하고 있다는 사실을 말이다.\\n\\u3000“나는 이따금씩 병든 상상에 사로잡히곤 한단다.” 그녀가 계속 이어 갔다. “그리고 지금은   내가 어떤 놀이를 보고 싶다는 병든 상상이 든   다. 자, 어서!” 그녀가 오른 손의 손가락들을 성마르게 움직이며 이렇게 말했다. “자, 어서, 어서, 어서!”\\n\\u3000잠시 동안 나는 내 누나(주인공과  20살차이)가 눈  앞에 나타나 나에게 일을 시킬 것 같은 두려움에 휩싸였다.(주인공꼬마가 미스 해비샴에게 잘 보이지 않으면 평생 대장장이 일을 시키겠다고 폭언을 퍼부었기 때문이다) 나는 자포자기 심정이 들어 ‘펌블추크 씨의  2륜 경마차(바퀴  두 개) 캐릭터’를 흉내 내며 방안을 이리저리 돌아다녀볼까 하는 생각 까지 먹었었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 내가 그 일을 성실히 수행할 것 같지 않아서 포기했다. 그리고 미스 해비샴을 빤히 쳐다보며 서 있었다. 내가 추측하건데 그런 내 행동이 그녀로 하여금 나를 고집 센 아이로 비춰지게 했던 것 같다.  우리가 서로를 유심히 쳐다보고 있을 때 그녀가 다음과 같이 말을 했기 때문이다.\\n“너 시무룩하고 고집이 세구나?”\\n\\u3000“아닙니다, 마님, 전 그냥 마님께 죄송해서요, 송구스럽게도 제가 당 장은 놀 수 없을 것 같아서요. 만약 마님께서 절 이대로 돌려보내신다면 전 누나에게 혼이 날거예요. 그래서 할 수만 있다면 놀려고 했는데 그만, 여긴 너무 새롭고 너무 낯설고 너무 훌륭하고…, 그리고 그리고 우울한….” 여기서 난 그만 말문이 막혀버렸다. 내가 너무 나갔다는 생 각이 들자 두려움이  밀려왔다.\\n\\u3000하지만 어쩌랴 벌써 말해버렸는걸. 우리는 또 그렇게 서로가 서로를 유심히  쳐다보기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 내게서 눈을 떼 자신이 입고 있는 드레스를 내려다보았다. 그녀는 또 화장대(가구)를 쳐다보았다. 그녀가 자신의 모습을 거울에 비춰보았다. 그녀가 다시 말을 했다.\\n\\u3000“이 애에게는 모든 게 새롭군.” 그녀가 중얼거렸다. “나에겐 모든 게 지루한데. 이 애에겐 모든 게 낯설다니. 내겐 모든 게 익숙한데. 우리 둘 다에겐 너무 우울해! 에스텔라를 불러다오.”\\n\\u3000그녀가 여전히 거울 속에 비췬 자신의 모습을 바라보며 말을 했기 때문에 난 그녀가 아직도 혼자 말을 즐기고 있는 줄 알고 가만히 있었다.\\n“에스텔라를  부르라니까.”  그녀가  내게  번쩍  빛나는  시선을 내던지며 되풀이했다. “그건 할 수 있겠지. 에스텔라를 불러라. 입구에서.”\\n\\u3000제대로 알지도 못하는 저택에서 그것도 불가사의한 복도의 어둠 속에 서서는, 눈에 보이지도 않고 아무런 대꾸도 없는 젊은 아가씨를 그 것도 나를 경멸하는 젊은 아가씨의 이름 “에스텔라”를 고함치며 부르는 것은 정말 옳지 않은 방종(제멋대로)이었다. 내가 느낀 이 모두는, 방금 전 명령에 따라 놀이를 해야 했었던 상황만큼이나 끔찍했다.\\n\\u3000마침내 그녀에게서 대답이 들려왔다. 그리고 그녀의 촛불이 하나의 별처럼 어두운 복도를 따라 걸어오고 있었다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴이 그녀에게 손짓하며 가까이 다가오라고 하더니 테이블 에서 보석 하나를 집어 들어 그 아름다운 아가씨의 가슴 위와 그녀의 귀여운 갈색 머릿결 위에 갖다 대며 보석이 어떤 효과를 줄 주 있는지를 시험해보았다.\\n\\u3000“네 것이 될 거야, 언젠가는, 얘야, 잘 사용하도록 해라. 자 이 애와 카드놀이를  해보 거라.”\\n“이 애랑? 어째서죠? 이 앤 그냥 천한 막노동 소년이잖아요!”\\n\\u3000내 생각에 내가 미스 해비샵의 대답을 우연히 들은 것 같았다. 그녀의 대답은 너무나 있을 법하지 않은 대답이었다. “그래? 넌 저애의 심장을 산산조각 낼 수 있니.”\\n\\u3000“무슨 놀이를 할 수 있지, 이 꼬마야?” 에스텔라가 이 세상에서 가장 경멸적인 표정을 지어보이며 내게 물었다.\\n\\u3000“‘내 이웃을 거지로 만드는 게임’밖엔 몰라요, 아가씨.” (‘내 이웃을 거지로 만드는 게임’은 ‘상대편의 패를 전부 빼앗을 때까지 둘이서 하는 놀이’라고 함.  네이버검색)\\n“저 애를 거지로 만들 거라.” 미스 해비샴이 에스텔라에게 얘기했다. 그래서 우리는 앉아서 카드게임을 하게 되었다.\\n\\u3000이 방에 있는 모든 것들, 벽시계와 손목시계 같은 것들이 오래전에 정지되었다는 사실을 내가 이해하기 시작한 것은 바로 그때였다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴이 보석을 집어 들었던 바로 그 장소에 정확히 도로 내 려놓는 것을 나는  주목했다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 카드들을 돌리는 동안 나는 화장대를 흘끗 다시 쳐다보았다. 화장대 위에 구두가 놓여 있었다. 한때는 흰색이었을 테지만 이젠 노래진 구두였다. 그 구두가 한 번도 신은 적이 없는 구두라는 사실을 알아챘다.\\n\\u3000그 구두가 원래 신겨져 있어야했을 그 발을 흘끗 내려다보았다. 그 발에는 실크 스타킹이 착용되어  있었다.  한때는  흰색이었을  테지만 이젠 노래진 실크 스타킹이었다. 그 실크 스타킹이 너무 밟아서 뭉개지고 누더기가 되어 있는 것을 알아챘다.\\n\\u3000모든 것이 이렇게 정지되어 있지 않았더라면, 모든 것이 창백하고 부패한 물체들인 양 서있지만 않았더라도, 붕괴된(쇠약한) 형체 위에 입혀진 말라빠진 “신부 드레스조차도” 그토록 시체에 입혀놓은 옷처럼은 보이지 않았을 테고 “긴 면사포조차도” 그토록 수의처럼은 보이지 않았을 텐데.\\n\\u3000우리가 카드놀이를 하는 내내 그녀는 마치 송장(시체)처럼 그 자리에 앉아 있었다. 그녀의 신부 드레스에 달린 “주름 장식들과 장신구들이” 흙으로 만들어진 종이처럼 보였다.\\n\\u3000종종(이따금씩), 옛날에 파묻힌 시체들로 구성된 발견들, 특히 그 시 체들이 발견되는 즉시 가루로 변해버린 발견들에 대해선 그때 당시 내가 아는 게 전혀  없었다.\\n하지만  이후로  나는  종종  생각해보곤  한다.  그때  당시  “그녀의 모습”이, 마치 낮의 자연광(태양빛)이 들어와 그녀에게 부딪치면 그녀를 먼지로 만들어버릴 것처럼 보였음이 틀림없다고 나는 이후 종종 생각 해보곤 한다.\\n\\u3000 “저 앤 네이브를 잭이라고 불러요, 이 꼬마가 말이에요!” 우리의 첫 카드 게임이 끝나기도 전에 에스텔라가 경멸이 가득 담긴 말을 내게 했다. “저 애의 손들은 어쩜 저렇게 거칠까! 그리고 저 부츠들은 어쩜 저렇게 두꺼울까!”\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 그 말을 하기 전까지 나는 한 번도 내 두 손이 부끄러울 수 있다는 생각을 해본 적이 없었다.  하지만 나는 내 두 손이 형편없는 한 짝이라고 여기기 시작했다.  나에 대한 그녀의 멸시는 너무 강했다. 그녀의 말은 전염성을 띄고 있었고 내가 거기에 걸려던 것이다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 게임을 이겼다.  그리고 내가 카드를 나누어주었다. 내가 카드를 잘못 나누어주고 말았다. 그건 너무 당연한 결과였다. 내가 실수하 기만을 그녀가 기다리고 있다는 사실을 내가 알고 있는 그런 상황 아 래에서는 말이다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 나를 맹렬히 비난했다. “이 멍청하고, 칠칠맞은 막노동 소년 아!”라고.\\n\\u3000“너는 저애에게 아무런 말도 하지 않는구나.” 우리를 지켜보고 있던 미스 해비샴이 말했다. “저 애는 네게 심한 말들을 많이 하는데, 왜 넌 저 애에게 아무런 대꾸도 하지 않는 거지. 저 애에 대해 어떻게 생각 하느냐?”\\n“말하고 싶지 않아요.” 내가 말까지 더듬어가며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그럼 내 귀에다 대고 말해다오.” 미스 해비샴이 몸을 굽히며 말했다.\\n“저 애는 아주 거만한 것 같아요.” 내가 속삭이며 대답했다. “그 밖에 또?”\\n“저 애는 아주 예쁜 것 같아요.”\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n“그  밖에 또?”\\n\\u3000“저 애는 아주 무례한 것 같아요.” 내가 이 말을 할 때, 그녀(에스텔 라)가 극도로 혐오스럽다는 듯 나를 쳐다보고 있었기 때문이다.\\n“그  밖에 또?”\\n“집에  갔으면 좋겠어요?”\\n“그리고 저 애를 다시 안 보겠다고, 저렇게 예쁜 애를?”\\n\\u3000“제가 저 애를 다시 안 보고 싶은지는 확실치 않지만 다만 지금은    집에  갔으면 좋겠어요.”\\n\\u3000“곧 보내 주겠다.” 미스 해비샴이 큰 소리로 이렇게 말했다. “게임을 끝마치어라.”\\n\\u3000처음에  본 그녀의  그 기묘한  미소만 아니었어도, 나는 미스 해비샴의 얼굴이 미소를 지을 수 없는 얼굴이라는 사실을 거의 확신했을 것 이다(확신하지 못하다 이후 상처를 받게 되었다는 의미).\\n\\u3000그녀 주변의 모든 것들이 그 자리에서 움쭉 못하게(정지된) 되었던 바로 그때, 경계하는 표정과 생각에 잠긴 표정이 그녀의 얼굴에 자리잡은 것 같았다. 이제 그 어떤 것도 그녀의 얼굴에서 그것(경계하고 생 각에 잠긴 표정)을 다시 들어 올릴 수 없을 것만 같이 보였다.\\n\\u3000그녀의 가슴도 쳐져 있었다. 그래서 그녀의 몸은 굽어 있었다. 그녀의 목소리도 축 쳐져 있었다. 그래서 그녀는 낮게 말했다. 이 모두가, 그녀가 지금 죽음의 소강상태에 머물러 있다는 느낌을 주었다.\\n\\u3000전적으로, 그녀의 외모는 안팎이 모두 축 늘어진 육체와 축 늘어진  영혼 그 자체였다. 그녀 자신이 가장 먼저 그 압도적인 강풍의 무게에 짓눌려 있는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000나는 에스텔라와 그 게임(카드)을 끝까지 했다. 그리고 그녀가 나를 거지로 만들었다(그녀가 ‘상대방을 거지로 먼저 만들기’ 게임에서 나를 이겼다). 그녀가 카드를 모두 가졌을 때였다. 내게서 빼앗은 카드 따위는 이제 경멸스럽다는 듯 카드를 테이블 아래로 매몰차게 내던졌다.\\n\\u3000“언제 다시 왔으면 좋겠니?” 미스 해비샵이  내게  말했다.  “가만있자.”\\n\\u3000내가 오늘이 수요일이라는  사실을  그녀에게  막 상기(기억)시켜주려 던 찰나였다. 그녀가 앞서 했던 그 “성마른 표시, 오른 손 손가락들을 성마르게 흔드는 표시”를 하며 나를 제지했다.\\n\\u3000“저 봐, 저 봐! 나는 요일을 전혀 모른다. 나는 일 년 중 몇 주째인  지도 전혀 모른다. 엿새(6)후 다시 오거라. 알겠지?”\\n“예, 마님.”\\n\\u3000“에스텔라, 저 애를 아래까지 데려다 주거라. 먹을 것을 주도록 하고. 산책도 시키고. 그리고 저 애가 먹는 동안 (양조장과 안뜰과 정원을) 이리저리 둘러볼 수 있도록 해줘라. 가거라. 핍.”\\n\\u3000촛불을 따라 올라 왔듯이, 나는 그녀(에스텔라)가 든 촛불을 따라 내려갔다. 그녀(에스텔라)는 우리들이 처음 촛불을 발견했던 그 장소에 촛불을 세워놓았다. 그녀가 옆문을 열 때까지, 그것에 대해 생각해보지 않고서 나는 지금이 필연적으로 밤 시간일거라고 상상했었다. 문이 열 리고 일광(햇볕)이 한꺼번에 내게로 내리쬐었을 때 나는 무척이나 당 황스러웠다. 내가 마치 촛불이 켜져 있던 그 이상한 방에 많은 시간을 보내고 나온 느낌이  들었다.\\n\\u3000“넌 여기서 기다려야해, 꼬마 너 말이야.”라며 에스텔라가 말했다. 그녀는 사라지더니 문을 닫아버렸다.\\n\\u3000나는 그제야 안뜰에서 혼자 있게 되었다. 그건 내가 거친 내 두 손을 바라다볼 기회를 주었고 내 흔해빠진 부츠를 내려다볼 기회를 주었다. 이 액세서리들에 대한 내 의견은 호의적이지 않은 쪽으로 흘렀다. 그것은 이전에는 전혀 문제가 되지 않던 문제들이었다. 하지만 지금은 문제가 되었다. 내가 그것을 상스러운 부속물들로 여기기 시작했기 때 문이다.\\n\\u3000나는 집에 돌아가는 대로 조(선하지만 약간 어리숙한 매형)에게 왜 내게 ‘네이브라고 불러야 할 그림패들’을 ‘잭’이라고 부르게 가르쳤는지 단단히 따지기로  마음먹었다.\\n\\u3000나는 바랬다. 조(매형)가 좀 더 고상하게 양육되었더라면 하고 나는 바랬다. 그리고 만약 조가 좀 더 고상하게 양육되었더라면 나도 역시 조에 의해 고상하게 양육될 수 있었을 텐데.\\n\\u3000그녀(에스텔라)가 약간의 빵과 고기 그리고 맥주를 채운 작은 머그 잔을 하나 가지고 돌아왔다. 그녀가 머그잔을 마당의 돌들 위에 내려놓은 후 나를 쳐다보지도 않은 채 빵과 고기를 내게 건넸다. 그녀의 그런 행동들이 너무 거만했기 때문에 난 내가 마치 한 마리 개인 양 모멸감을 느꼈다.\\n\\u3000나는 너무 굴욕감을 느꼈고 상처 받았으며 퇴짜 받았고 공격당했기 때문에 화가 났고 또한 슬펐다. 그 쓰라림의 정확한 명칭이 떠오르지 않았다. 신만이 그 쓰라림의 명칭을 알리라. 눈물들이 내 두 눈에서 쏟아나기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000눈물이 쏟아나려는 순간, 내 눈물에 대한 원인이 그녀에게 있는 것을 확인한 ‘소녀가’ 재빨리 기쁨의 표정을 지어며 나를 쳐다보았다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 나를 바라보고 있다는 사실에, 나는 눈물을 삼킨 후 그녀를 똑똑히 쳐다보았다. 그래서 그녀는 짜증스러워 못 참겠다는 듯 고개를    홱 쳐들고는 나를 남겨둔 채 떠나버렸다. 내 생각에 그녀의 그런 행동에는, 내(주인공꼬마)가 아주 많이 상처 입었다는 사실을 그녀가 확실하게 확신하게 되었다는 의미가 담겨 있는 것 같았다,\\n\\u3000하지만 그녀가 가버리자, 난 내 얼굴을 감추어줄 장소를 둘러보았고 결국 양조장 쪽으로 통하는 문들 중 하나에 숨어들어갔다. 벽에 소매를 댄 채 소매 위에 내 이마를 파묻고는 울었다.\\n\\u3000나는 울면서 발로 벽을 찼고 내 머리카락을 심하게 쥐어뜯었다. 내 감정들은 너무 쓰라렸고, 이름도 모를 그 쓰라림들은 너무나도 날카로 웠기 때문에 난 중화작용(반작용, 음식섭취 후 산책)이 필요했다.\\n\\n\\u3000내 누나(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)의 양육은 나를 예민하게(상처를  잘 받게) 만들었었다. 누가 아이들을 양육하든지 간에 아이들이 존재하는 그 조그만 한 동심 속에서, 부당한 처사만큼 미세하게 감지되고 미세하게 체험되는 것은 아무것도 없다.\\n\\u3000아이에게 노출될 수 있는 그 부당한 처사가 아주 사소한 것일 수도 있다. 하지만 아이는 작다. 아이가 가진 동심의 세계는 더 작다. 그 아이의 흔들 목마는, 비율로 따지면, 골격이 우람한 ‘아이리시 헌터’(승마용 말의 이름, 발바닥에서 등까지의 높이가 1.7미터)보다 몇 십 센티미   터 더 높다(그래서 떨어지기  쉽다).\\n\\u3000내 자신의 내면세계에 대해 말하자면, 난 유아기 때부터 나에게 가 해지는 부당한 처사와 끊임없이 투쟁하며 견뎌왔다. 내가 말을 할 수  있을 때부터 난, 누나가 변덕스럽고 폭력적인 강압으로 나를 부당하게 대우하고 있다는 사실을  알아차렸었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그녀가 나를 손수 기른다는 사실이 그녀로 하여금 나를 당기고 밀치며 찌르고 비틀며 흔들고 홱 내던지면서 나를 키울 권리를 그녀에게 준 것은 아니라는 굳은 확신을 내 마음속에 간직해 왔었다.\\n\\u3000모든 벌(처벌)들과, 수치(망신)들과, 밥 굶기기들, 그리고 잠 못 자게 하기, 그리고 여타 참회를 강요당한 무수한 나날들을 경험하면서 나는  “이 확신(누나가 나를 기른다고 나를 때릴 권리까진 없다)”을 오랫동안  품어왔던 것이다.\\n\\u3000그런 은둔의 방식으로 그리고 보호받지 못한 방식으로 “그 확신”과  너무 많이 교감하는 가운데, 내가 정신적으로 소심하고 아주 예민해진 것이라는 생각을 나는 오랫동안 품어왔다.\\n\\u3000양조장(술 만들고 도매하는 곳) 벽에 발길질을 해대고 내 머리카락을 쥐어뜯는 동안 내 상처받은 감정들도 제거되었다. 그런 다음 난 내 얼굴을 소매로 고루(잘) 닦은 후 문 뒤에서 나왔다.\\n\\u3000빵과 고기는 먹을 만했다. 맥주는 따뜻하고 따끔따끔한 게 맛이 괜 찮았다(따뜻한 맥주도 있군요. *_*  처음  알았음.  신기하네요.  한 번도 안 먹어봤는데. 신기~). 나는 곧 내 주변을 돌아볼 정도로 활기를 띄게 되었다.\\n\\u3000틀림없다. 이 곳(양조장)은 사람이 살지  않는  곳이었다. 양조장에 있 는 비둘기장까지 사람이 살지 않는 곳이었다. 약간 센 바람이 불어 비둘기장이 꼭대기를 기준으로 바람에 기우뚱거리고 있었다. 만약 비둘 기장 안에 비둘기들이 있어 바람에 의해 자신들이 그렇게 기우뚱거렸 다면 아마 비둘기들은 자신들이 지금 바다에 있다고 생각했을 것이다. 하지만 그 비둘기장에는 비둘기가 단 한 마리도 없었다. 외양간에도 말이 단 한 마리도 없었다. 돼지우리에도 돼지가 단 한 마리도 없었다. 창고에도 맥아(발아시킨 보리)가 단 한 알도  없었다.  물 끊이는 솥과 대형 통에서는 곡물과 맥주 냄새가  전혀 나지 않았다.  그  양조장의 모 든  용도와  향기는  마지막으로  내보낸  연기와  함께  증발한  것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000옆 뜰(마당)에는 속이 텅 빈 수많은 술통들이 쌓여있었다. 술통들은 좋았던 지난날에 대한 어떤 시큼한 추억을 자기들 주변에 간직하고 있었다. 하지만 그것은 너무 시큼해서 지난 날의 맥주에 대한 견본(샘 플)으로써 받아들여질 수 없는 것들이었다. 이러한 측면에서 내가 대다  수 사람들처럼 은둔자였듯이, 나는 그 술통들을 은둔자들로써 기억한다.\\n\\u3000양조장 가장 끝자락 뒤로, 오래된 담으로  둘러싸인  무성한  정원이 하나 있었다. 담이 그렇게 높지 않았기 때문에 나는 버둥거리며 올라가 붙잡은 채 좀 더 오래 버티며 그 너머를 바라다볼 수 있었다. 엉킨 잡초들이 너무 크게 자라 있어 무성해보인 그 정원은, 이 집에 딸린 정원이었다. 하지만 초록색과 노란색 길 위로 사람의 발자국 흔적이 보였다. 마치 누군가가 이따금씩 저쪽으로 걸어간 것만 같았다. 게다가 그때까지도 에스텔라가 내게서 멀어지고 있었다(저쪽으로 걸어가고 있 었다).\\n\\u3000하지만 그녀는 모든 곳에 있는 것만 같았다. 내가 술통들을 밟고 일 어서려는 유혹에 굴복해 술통 위를 걷기 시작했을 때, 나는 술통이 가득한 안뜰 끝자락에서 술통들 위를 걷고 있는 그녀를 보았다. 그녀는 등을 내 쪽으로 향하고 있었다. 그리고 그녀는 두 손에 그녀의 예쁜  갈색 머릿결을 붙잡아 넓게 펼치고 있었다. 그녀는 전혀 뒤를 돌아보지 않았다. 그러더니 내 시야에서 곧장 사라졌다.\\n\\u3000양조장(맥주공장) 건물은, 다시 말해 바닥이 포장되어 있고 크고 높은 건물, 한때 맥주를 만들곤 하던 곳이다. 그 안에는 아직도 양조용 기구들이  그대로 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 처음 양조장(맥주공장)안으로 들어가려다 그 어두움에 아주 짓 눌려 문 근처에 선채 내 주변을  둘러보고 있을 때, 나는 그녀가 불이  끄진 난로들 사이를 걸어 어떤 가벼운 철제 계단들을 오른 후 머리 위에 있던 최상층 관람석을 지나 밖으로 나가는 것을 보았다. 그건 마치 그녀가 하늘 속으로 나가고 있는 것만 같았다.\\n\\n(아래에서부터는 ‘양조장’이라는 단어 대신 ‘맥주공장’이라는 쉬운 단어를  사용하겠습니다. 양조장이 뭔지 저조차도 이미지가 쉽게 그려지지 않아서요~.~)\\n\\n\\u3000이상한 것이 내 환상 속에 나타난 것도 이 장소, 그리고 이 순간이었다. 나는 그때도 뭔가 이상하다고 생각했는데 이후 오랜 시간이 지나 다시 생각해봐도 이상했다. 아니 더 심하게 이상했다.\\n\\u3000쌀쌀맞은 빛을 올려다보다 약간 흐릿해진 내가 눈을 막, 내 오른 편에 있는 건물 구석 아래의 거대한 목재 빔(들보)쪽으로 돌리자마자 나는 거기서 목메 단채 매달려있는 어떤 형상 하나를 보았다.\\n\\u3000두 발에는 구두를  한 짝만 걸친 형상,  누렇게 색이 바랜 흰색 옷을 온 몸에 걸친 형상이었다. 그런 식으로 매달려 있었기  때문에  나는  좀 더 자세히 볼 수 있었고, 드레스에 달린 색이 바란 액세서리들이 마치 흙으로 빗은 종이 같았다. 그리고 그 얼굴은 미스 해미샴의 얼굴이었다. 그  얼굴은 마치 나를 부르려고 절규하는 듯 했고 그 절규의 몸부림이 얼굴표정이 되어 얼굴전체에 퍼지고 있는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그런 형체를 보는 것은 끔찍했다. 방금 전까지만 해도 그 형상이 거기에 없었다는 어떤 확신이 있었기 때문에 더 두려웠다. 나는 그 장소에서 달아났다. 곧 다시 그 쪽으로 달려가 보았다. 거기서 아무런 흔적을 발견하지 못했을 때 내 공포는 최대로 치솟았다.\\n\\u3000그야말로 청쾌한(쾌활한) 하늘 아래 ‘쌀쌀맞은 빛’ 그뿐이었다. 그야 말로 안뜰 문의 빗장들 너머로 지나가고 있는 사람들의 모습 그 뿐이었다. 그리고 채 다 먹지 못한 빵과 고기 그리고 맥주에 대한 내 배고픔이 되살아나 나는 다시 제자리로 돌아왔다.\\n\\u3000심지어 내가 먹다 남겼던 음식들로 배를 다 채웠었지만, 만약  내가  나를 나가게 하려고 열쇠를 들고 내게로 걸어오고 있는 에스텔라의 모 습을 보지 못했다면 나는 그렇게나 빨리 원기를 회복하진 못했을 수도 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그때 이렇게 생각했다. ‘만약 내가 겁에 질린 표정을 지으면 그녀가 볼 것이고 그럼 그녀가 나를 더 얕잡아볼 합당한 이유를 그녀에게 주는 것일  뿐이라고.’\\n\\u3000그러니 그녀는 이제 나를 얕잡아볼 어떤 합당한 이유도 가지지 못할 것이다.\\n\\u3000내 옆을 지나가던 그녀(에스텔라)가 의기양양한 표정으로 나를 흘끗 쳐다보았다. 그건 마치 내 손들이 거칠고 내 부츠가 지나치게 두껍다는 사실을 재삼 확인한 것이 너무 즐겁다는 표정 같았다. 그녀가 문을 열었다. 그녀가 문을 붙잡은 채 서 있었다. 그녀를 쳐다보지도 않으려고 노력하며 나가려는데 그녀가 나를 비웃듯 손으로 툭 쳤다.\\n“왜  안 우니?”\\n“울고  싶지 않으니까.”\\n\\u3000“울고 싶잖아.” 그녀가 말했다. “반장님이 될 때까지 넌 울고 있었어. 그리고 지금 다시 울려는 거고.”\\n\\u3000그녀는 경멸하며 웃었다. 그러더니 나를 문밖으로 밀치곤 내 뒤에서 문을 잠가버렸다.\\n\\u3000나는 그 길로 펌블추크 씨 집으로 곧장 걸어갔다. 그가 집에 없었다. 그 사실을 알고 나는 몹시 안도했다. 가게점원에게 “내가 미스 해비샴의 집을 다시 방문하기로 한 날짜”를 알려준 후 6.4킬로미터(1시간 30분 거리) 떨어진 우리 집(대장간)을 향해 출발했다.\\n\\u3000혼자 걸어가면서 내가 오늘 보았던 모든 것들에 대해 곰곰이 생각해 보기 시작했다. 그러자 “내가 흔해빠진 막노동 소년이라는 점, 내 손들이 유독 거칠다는 점, 내 부츠가 지나치게 두껍다는 점, 내가 네이브 (카드)를 잭(카드)이라고 부르는 천하고 어리석은 습관에  물들어  있다는 점, 어젯밤 생각했었던 것보다 내가 훨씬 더 무식하다는 점, 대체로 내가 형편없는 하층 생활을 지금까지 견지해오며 살아왔었다는 점 등등”이 떠올랐고, 집이 가까워지면서 그와 같은 생각들이 나를 중심으로 점점 더 빠르게 회전하고 있었다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 9장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000내가 집에 도착했을 때, 누나(20살차이)는 미스 해비샴의 저택에 대해 알고 싶은 호기심이 너무 강해 수만 가지 질문들을 내게 쏟아 부었다.\\n\\u3000나는 곧 뒤로 붙들린 채 목덜미와 허리 뒷부분을 사정없이 얻어맞고서 부엌 벽에 얼굴이 힘껏 뭉개지고 있었다. 누나의 질문들에 충분히 길게 답변을 하지 않았기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000만약 “이해받지 못하는 것에 대한 공포”가, 내 가슴 속에 숨겨져 있던(상태) 것과 같은 강도로 다른 청소년(14세)들의 가슴 속에서도  숨겨져 있다면, 나는 그럴 가능성이 크다고 보지만, 그것이 바로 내가 왜 괴물이 아니었었는지에 대해 스스로에게 반문해보지 않았던 특별한 이 유이며 그것이 또한 지금 내가 하고 있는 입 다물기에 대한 이유들인 것이다.\\n\\u3000설령 내가 미스 해비샴의 저택에 대해 자세히 설명했어도 그들은 이 해하지 못했을 것이다. 그 뿐만이 아니다. 내가 미스 해비샴에 대해 설 명을 했더라도 그들은 미스 해비샴을 이해하지 못했을 것이다.\\n\\u3000비록 내게 그녀는 이해할 수 없는  불가해한  존재였지만,  그렇다고 내가 그녀의 진짜 모습을 ‘조 부인’(주인공의 누나)의 사색의 대상으로 끌어다 놓는다면 나는 그런 내 행동에는 음탕하고 이율배반적인 어떤  것이 도사리고 있으리라는 인상을 받았기 때문이다. 거기엔 꼬마 숙녀 에스텔라도 마찬가지였다.\\n\\u3000그래서 난 내가 보고 들은 것을 최대한 적게 발설하기 작정했고 당연히 누나는 길길이 화가 나서는 부엌 벽에다 내 얼굴은 뭉개며 묵사   발을  만들고 있었다.\\n\\u3000상황을 최악으로 치닫게  한  것은,  약자를  괴롭히길  극히  좋아하는 저 늙고 몹쓸 펌블추크(잡곡상)의 등장이었다. 펌블추크(잡곡상)가 내가 보고 들은 모든 것들에 대한 게걸스러운 호기심을 주체하지 못해 2륜 경마차(바퀴 두 개)를 몰고 그것도 차 마시는 시간에 나타나선 자신에게 오늘 일을 소상하게 이실직고하라며 입을 떡하니 벌리고선 뻐 끔뻐끔 거려댔기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000저 물고기 같은 눈과 입을 떡하니 벌린  채, 마치  재빨리 끝장을 보고 싶다는 듯 자신의 흙빛 머릿결을 휘날리면서, 비비꼬는 계산으로 자신의 양복 조끼를 불룩하니 채운 그가 마치 고문자 같은 비열한 시선을 내게 던지며 질문을 하는 바람에 난 더 악이 바쳐서 단 한 마디도 하지 않겠다고 마음먹기 시작했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“좋아, 꼬마야.” 자기 전용으로 지정된 벽난로 옆 의자에 앉자마자 펌블추크 삼촌(주인공의 실제 삼촌은 아님)이 이야기를 시작했다. “읍 외곽에서 어떻게 잘  했느냐?”\\n\\u3000내가 대답했다. “썩 잘요, 아저씨.” 그러자 누나(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)가 주먹으로 나를  갈겼다.\\n\\u3000“썩 잘, 썩… 뭐?” 펌블추크 씨가 되물었다. “썩 잘이란 대답은 없단다. 자 꼬마야, 얘기해 봐라, 네가 말하는 그 ‘썩 잘’이란 말은 무엇을 의미하니?”\\n\\u3000내 이마에 달라붙은 회반죽(부엌 벽에 뭉개진 자국) 때문인지도 모 르겠지만 난 절대 아무 말도 하지 않겠다고 똥고집을 부렸다. 어쨌든, 회반죽까지 이마에 붙인 내 똥고집은 다이아몬드였다. 나는 얼마동안 심사숙고 한 다음 마치 내가 새로운 것을 발견한 것처럼 이렇게 대답했다. “제가 말한 ‘썩 잘’은 ‘썩 잘’을 의미해요.”\\n\\u3000더 이상은 참지 못하겠다는 듯 누나(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)가 고함을 내지르더니 내게로 달려들려 했고, 조(주인공의 매형)는 대장간 에서 일하고 있는 관계로 아무런 방패막이 나에겐(꼬마) 없고, 따라서 ‘펌블추크 씨’(잡곡상)가 가까스로 누나를  제지하며  이렇게  말해야했 다. “안됩니다! 안돼요! 이성을 잃지 마세요. 이 소년을 제게 맡겨두세   요, 부인. 이 소년을 제게 맡겨두세요.” 이제야말로 내(주인공) 목을 자르겠다는 듯이 펌블추크 씨가 고개를 돌이며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“자, 8만 6천원은 천 원짜리로 몇 장이지?” 이 질문은 아마 우리(누나, 주인공, 펌블추크 씨)의 주의를 딴 데로 돌려 우리 생각들을 잠시 정리하자는 의미인 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000난 그 물음에 “8만 6천개요.”라고 대답하려다 곰곰이 생각해보니 그 렇게 답했다가는 아무래도 살아남을 것 같지 않아 최대한 비슷한 숫자를 답으로 제시했다. 아마 6개정도 틀린 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그러자 “천 원짜리가 열 장 모이면 만원이다.”로 시작해선 “천 원짜 리가 80장모이면 8만원이다.”로 이어지며 내게 “지폐환산표”를 주입시 키는데 성공한 그가  의기양양해져선  이번에야  말로  나를  해치웠다는 듯 이렇게 물었다. “자! 8만 6천원은 천 원짜리로 몇 장이지?”\\n\\u3000이 질문에 한 동안 뜸을 들인 후 내가 대답했다. “모르겠어요.” 솔직히 말하자면 그때 이들의 처사에 매우 화가 난 상태였던지라 실제 내가 그 질문에 대한 답을 알고 있었는지도 의문이 든다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨는 자신의 머리를 나사처럼 돌려가며 내게서 정답을 뜯 어내려는 듯 이렇게  말했다.\\n\\u3000“예를 들어, 8만 6천원은 만 원짜리가 8장이니까 천 원짜리로 80장 이고 6천 원은 천 원짜리가 6장이지, 그러니까 8만 6천원은 천 원짜리로 총  86장이지?”\\n\\u3000 “맞아요!”라고 내가 말했고 그 즉시 누나(친누나, 20살차이)가 손바 닥으로 내 두 귀에다가 따귀를 때렸다. 그럼에도 불구하고 내 대답 때문에 그(펌블추크 씨)의 농담이 엎질러져버렸고 그 바람에 그가 꼼짝  달싹 못하는 모습을 보는 건 정말 통쾌한 일이었다.\\n\\u3000“그래 소년아! 미스 해비샴은 어떤 사람이더냐?”  가까스로  정신을 차린 펌블추크 씨가 두 팔을 자신의 가슴팍에 단단히 붙인 채 나사 돌 리듯이 내게 또 묻기  시작했다.\\n“아주 키가 커고 시커멓게 생겼어요.” 내가 그에게 말했다. “그녀가요, 삼촌?” 누나가  물었다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨가 동의의 표시로 살짝 윙크를 지어보였다. 그 행동으로부터 나는 그가 한 번도 미스 해비샴을 만난 적이 없었음을 즉시 알아 차렸다. 왜냐하면 그녀는 키가 커지도 시커멓게 생기지도 않았기 때문 이다.\\n\\u3000“됐어!” 펌블추크 씨가 우쭐대며 누나에게 말했다. “이것이 바로 저 애를 다루는 방법이죠! 우리 뜻대로 된 것 같습니다. 안 그렇습니까, 부인?”\\n\\u3000“물론이에요, 삼촌.”라며 ‘조 부인’(주인공의 누나)이 맞장구를 쳤다. “삼촌께서 저 녀석을 데리고 계셨으면 좋을 텐데. 저 녀석을 다루는 방법을 이리도 잘  아시니.”\\n\\u3000“자, 소년아! 그녀(미스 해비샴)가 무엇을 하고 있더냐? 네가 오늘 방안으로 들어갔을 때 말이다.” 펌블추크 씨가 물었다.\\n\\u3000“그녀는 앉아 있었어요.” 내가 대답했다. “검은색 벨벳(융단) 대형4 륜마차 안에요.”\\n펌블추크  씨와  조  부인(주인공의  누나)이  서로  쳐다보았다. 그리고 당연하게도 둘 다 이렇게 말했다. “검은색 벨벳(융단) 대형4륜마차 안 이라고?”\\n\\u3000 “네.”라고 내가 말했다. “그리고 에스텔라 양이, 제  생각에  그녀는 미스 해비샴의 조카 같았어요. 마차 창문을 통해 에스텔라 양이 미스 해비샴에게 케이크와 와인을 건네주었지요. 황금 접시에 담아서 말이 에요. 그리고 우리 모두는 황금 접시에 담긴 그 케이크와 와인을 먹었 어요. 저는 마차 뒷좌석에서 일어나 먹었어요, 미스 해비샴이 그렇게 먹으라고 시켰거든요.”\\n“그 자리에 다른 사람들은 없더냐?” 펌블추크 씨가 물었다. “네 마리의 개들이 있었어요.” 내가 말했다.\\n“크더냐. 작더냐?”\\n\\u3000“어마어마했어요.” 내가 말했다. “그 녀석(개)들이 황금 광주리에 담겨 있던 ‘얇게 저민 송아지 고기들’을 먼저 차지하기 위해서 막 싸웠어요.”\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨와 조 부인(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)이 대경실색하며 서로를 다시 한 번 쳐다보았다. 내 자신도 내가 하는 거짓말들에 도취되어선 지금 제정신이 아니었다. 그들의 질문은  고문이었고  난  지금 앞뒤 사정을 가리지 않고 비밀을 꾸며서라도 만들어 내고 있는 몰락한 증인일 뿐이었다. 고문을 당한 증인은 뭔 말이고 꾸며낼 수 있다.\\n“세상에 맙소사, 그런 대형4륜마차가 어디에 있데?” 누나가 물었다. “미스 해비샴의 방에요.”라고 내가 말하자, 그들이(펌블추크 씨와 누\\n나) 다시 한 번 서로를 쳐다보았다. “하지만 마차에 말은 없었어요.” 호화로운 장식용 천을 씌운 네 마리의 준마(잘 달리는 말)들이 마구에 채워져 있더라는 말을 막 하려던 찰나 아무래도 내가 너무 나가는 것 같아 말을 삼킨 후 “하지만 마차엔 어떤 말들도 딸려 있지 않았어요.”라는 유보조항을 넣는 선에서 내 얘기를 마쳤던 것이다.\\n\\u3000“이게(미스 해비샴의 방안에 대형4륜마차가 있는 것) 가능한가요, 삼촌?” 조 부인(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)가 물었다. “저 아이가 지금 무슨 소리를 하고 있는 거죠?”\\n\\u3000“제가 말씀드리겠습니다, 부인.” 펌블추크 씨(능청맞은 잡곡상)가 말 했다. “제 생각에는, 그러니까 그건, 일종의 가마(사람 태우고 다니는 가마) 같습니다. 잘 아시다시피, 그녀(미스 해비샴)가 좀  경박해야죠, 아주 경박하고 변덕스러운 여자인걸요, 하루 종일 거마 위에서 보내고    도  남을 여자인걸요.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 삼촌도 그녀가 거마에 타고 있는 걸 보신 적이 있어요?” 조 부인(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)이  물었다.\\n\\u3000“제가 어떻게 알겠습니까.” 범행을 자백할 것을 강요당한 그가 되받 아쳤다. “저는 여태껏 그녀를 단 한 번도 만난 적이 없는걸요? 멀리서 그녀를 쳐다본 적도  없어요!”\\n“맙소사, 삼촌! 그러면서 지금까지 그녀에 대해 얘기하신 거예요?” “웬걸요, 부인께서도 아시잖습니까.”  펌블추크 씨가  무척 초조해하며\\n말했다. “제가 그 집에 들를 때면 저는 늘 그녀 방문  앞까지만 안내받는 걸요. 조금 열려 있는 문을 사이에 두고 그녀가 제게 말을 하죠. 그게 다에요. 부인께서도 사정을 모르신다고는 말씀 못하실 겁니다. 하지만 이 꼬마는 그 집에 놀러 갔으니까. 그래 무슨 놀이를 하고 놀았지, 꼬마야?”\\n\\u3000“우리들은 깃발들을 가지고 놀았어요.” 내가 말했다. 조심스럽게 말 하건대 내(주인공)가 이때 한 거짓말들을 되돌아보면 나도 내 자신에  대해 놀랍게 생각한다는 점을 꼭 알려주고 싶다.\\n “깃발들이라고!” 누나가 나를 따라  말했다.\\n\\u3000“예.” 내가  말했다. “에스텔라(소녀)가  파란 깃발을 흔들면 제가  빨  간 깃발을 흔들었지요. 그러면 미스 해비샴이 마차창문 밖으로  ‘깃발  위에 온통 금색 별들이 흩뿌려져 있는 깃발’을 흔들었지요. 그런 다음  우리 모두는 검을 뽑아 들고 ‘만세’하고 외쳤어요.”\\n“검이라고!” 누나가 외쳤다. “네가 검이 어디 있다고?”\\n\\u3000“벽장에서 꺼냈어요.” 내가 말했다. “벽장 안엔 총들도 있었어요. 잼 (먹는 잼)도 있었고 알약들도 있었어요. 그녀의 방 안엔 태양빛이 하나도 안 들어와요. 하지만 환하게 켜져 있는 수많은 촛불들 때문에 방안은  언제나 밝아요.”\\n\\u3000“그건 사실입니다, 부인.” 펌블추크 씨가 엄숙하게 고개를 끄떡여 보이며 말했다. “그게 그 방의 실제 모습이죠. 제가 여태껏 봐왔는걸요.” 그런 다음 그들(펌블추크 씨와 누나)이 나를 빤히 쳐다보았다. 그리고 나는 지금까지 내 말에 거짓이 단 한 줄도 없다는 마냥 얼굴에 꾸밈없는 표정을 짓기 위해 안달을 하며 그들을 빤히 쳐다보았다. 그러면서 나는 오른 손으로 왼쪽 바지를 땋았다(서로 엇갈리게 해서 한 가득으로 짜 엮었다).\\n\\u3000만약 그들이 단 한 마디라도 더 했다면 난 틀림없이 “다 거짓말이에 요”라고 자백해야했을 것이다. 왜냐하면 난 그 순간에도 “안뜰에 풍선이 하나있었다”는  거짓말을 막 하려던 찰나였는데, ‘풍선’과 ‘맥주공장에 있던 곰’으로 나뉜 내 불확실한 상상력이 뒤죽박죽되는 바람에 거짓말(안뜰에 풍선이 있었다)을 더 해볼 용기를 못 내고 있었기 때문이다.\\n하지만 내가 지금까지 들려준 이 경이로운 문제들에 대해 논의하느라 그들이 온통 정신이 팔려 있었기 때문에 결국 난 살아남을 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 착하지만 약간 어리숙한 매형, 대장장이)가 일을 마치고 차를 한  잔 마시러 들어왔을 때까지도  그들은 이 주제(방 안에 대형마  차 있다는 주인공의 거짓말)에 꽉 붙들려있었다.\\n\\u3000누나는 남편에게 큰 기쁨을 주기 위해서기보단 누나 자신의 구원(수다)을 위해 남편에게 내(주인공)가  지금까지  경험한  일들을 들려주었다.\\n\\u3000자(이제), 내가 조(주인공의 착하지만 많이  어리숙한 매형)를 보았을  때 조는 자신의 파란 눈을 말똥말똥 뜬 채 전해들은 얘기에 너무 놀라  어쩔 줄을 몰라  하며 부엌 안을 이리저리  돌아다니고 있었다.  내가  조의 그런 모습을 보았을 땐 정말이지 당장 속죄 받고 싶은 마음이 간절 했다. 하지만 이건 조에  대해서만 이었고 다른 두 사람(누나와  펌블추  크 씨)에 대해서는 단 일말도 미안하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000조에게 그리고 조라는 한 사람에 대해 난 내 자신이 어린 괴물이라고 여겼다. 그 와중에도 그들(펌블추크 씨와, 누나)은 오늘 일로 인해  향후 내가 “미스 해비샴의 지인들”이나 혹은 “미스 해비샴 본인”에게서 직간접적으로 받을 수도 있는 호의들에 대해 그들이 부엌에 앉아 열띤 토론을 벌이고 있었다. 그때 난 당황해하는 조를 보며  내 자신이 어린 괴물이라고 여기며 양심의 가책을 느끼고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“미스 해비샴이 미래의 내게 뭔가를 줄 것”임에 대해 그들은 한 치의 의심도 없었고, 그들의 의심은 단지 “그 뭔가”가 과연 어떤 형태를 띠며 내게 주어질 것인가에 초점이 맞추어져 있었다.\\n\\u3000누나는 그것이 “재산의 형태”를 띨 거라고 주장했다. 반면 펌블추크 씨(주인공의 매형의 진짜 삼촌)는 품위 있는 어떤 직종에 내가 도제공 (수습공)으로 들어갈 수 있게 그녀가 많은 액수의 할증료(덧붙여 주는 돈)를 내주는 것으로 호의가 베풀어질 거라고 주장했다. 그러면서 그가 덧붙이기를 그 품위 있는 직종에는 예를 들면 ‘곡물 장사나 씨앗 장 사’(펌블추크 씨가 잡곡상임)도 포함된다고  말했다.\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형)는 두 사람으로부터 치욕적인 창피를 당하고 말았는데, 그녀(미스 해비샴)가 내(주인공)게 얇게 저민 송아지 고기들을 차지하기  위해  맹렬히  싸웠다는  네  마리  개들  중  한  마리를 내(주인공)게 선물로 줄 수도 있다는 어찌 보면 자기 딴에는 똑똑한 제안을 제시했다가 그렇게 창피를 당하고  말았다.\\n\\u3000“이 멍텅구리야 바보도 너보단 더 좋은 의견들을 제시하겠다.”라며 누나가 핀잔을 주었다. “할 일 있으면 가서 일이나 마저 마쳐 이 멍텅 구리야.”라고 누나가 말하자 조는 대장간으로 건너갔다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨(능청맞은 잡곡상)가 자기  마차를  몰고  점포로  돌아간 후, 누나(주인공의 누나, 20살차이)가 설거지를 하고 있는 동안, 나는  조가 있는 대장간으로 슬그머니 들어갔다. 그리고 조가 오늘 밤에 해야 할 일들을 다 마칠 때까지 나는 그의 옆에 가만히 앉아 있었다.\\n\\u3000조가 일을 다 끝마쳤을 때 내가 이렇게 말했다. “화덕(대장간 불) 끄기 전에, 조, 나 할 말이 있어.”\\n\\u3000“그래, 핍?” 조(주인공의 매형)가 편자를 박을 때 쓰는 철제의자(말의 발을 옆으로 해서 의자 가운데에 끼울 수 있게 만든 대장간 기구) 를 화덕 가까이로 옮기며 말했다. “자 그럼 어디 한 번 들어볼까, 핍.   무슨 얘긴데?”\\n\\u3000“조.” 나는 ‘조가 둥글게 말아 올린 셔츠 소매’를 붙잡고 내 검지와 엄지손가락으로 비비 꼬며 말했다. “조,  내가 오늘 했던 말들 다 기억나? 미스 해비샴 얘기 말이야.”\\n“기억나다니?” 조가 말했다. “네 얘기들은 정말 놀랍더구나!” “아니 끔찍했어, 조. 내가 한 건 모두 사실이 아니야.”\\n\\u3000“너 지금 무슨 말을 하는 거니, 핍?” 조(착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인 물)가 깜짝 놀라 뒤로 물러서며 외쳤다. “그러니까 네 말은 그러니까  네가  그러니까 거….”\\n“맞아. 다 내가 꾸며낸 거야, 조.”\\n\\u3000“하지만 모두 다는 아니겠지? 왜 네가 모든 얘기들을 다 꾸며냈다고 생각하니, 핍? 그럼 ‘검은색 벨벳(융단) 대형…4륜마차’도 그곳에 없었 니?”\\n\\u3000내가 고개를 흔들며 서 있자  조가  또 물었다. “하지만  말이다. 적어도  어마어마하게  크다는  그  개들은  있었지  않니,  핍? 어서 말해봐라, 핍.” 조가 설득조로 말했다. “얇게 저민 송아지 고기들을 서로 차지하기 위해 막 싸웠다는 개들은 거기 있었을 거 아니니?”\\n“없었어, 조.”\\n\\u3000“개 한 마리도?” 조(주인공의 매형)가 말했다. “큰 개가 아니라면 강아지는 있었겠지, 핍?  어서.”\\n“없었어, 조, 그런 건 단 한 마리도 없었어.”\\n\\u3000내가 절망적인 눈빛으로 조를 올려다보았기 때문에 조도 당황해하며 나를 바라보았다. “핍, 이 녀석아! 이게 대체 무슨 일이냐, 어! 친구! 아이고!  어쩌려고 이랬니?”\\n“끔찍하지, 조, 그렇지  않아?”\\n\\u3000“끔찍하다니?” 조가 외쳤다. “두렵구나! 네게 지금 무슨 악령이 든 거냐?”\\n\\u3000“나도 내가 왜 그랬는지 몰라, 조.” 조의  셔츠 소매에서  손을 떼고  그의 발 끝부분에 있는 잿더미 위에 주저앉은 채 목을 쭉 내밀며 내가 말했다. “내게 왜 네이브라고 불러야 할 카드를 잭이라고 알려 준거야,  조. 왜 내 부츠는 이렇게 두껍고 내 손은 또 왜 이렇게 거칠지 않으면 안 돼, 조?”\\n\\u3000이 후 나는  조(매형)에게 내가 아주 비참한 심정이라는 것과,  내가 왜 ‘조 부인과 펌블추크 씨’에게  사실을  다 말하지  못했는지와  그들 (조 부인과 펌블추크 씨)이 내게 너무 심했다는 얘기들과, 그리고 끔찍한 여성인 ‘미스 해비샴’의 집에 그 아리따운 소녀가 있더라는 얘기를 했으며 그 여자 애가 나를 너무 거만하게 대해 내가 상처를 입었다는 얘기와, 그런 그녀가 나를 천한 막노동 소년이라고 부르더라는 얘기들   과, 나도 내가 흔해빠진 막노동 소년이라는 것을 알게 되었다는 얘기 들과, 나는 더 이상 막노동 소년이 되고 싶지 않다는 얘기들과, 이런 거짓말들이 어떻게 해서 나오게 되었는지, 나도  내가  왜  거짓말까지 하게 되었는지 모르겠다는 얘기들을 조에게 들려주었다.\\n\\u3000이것은 형이상학적인(사물의 본질을  파헤치는  철학) 문제였다. 적어도 내겐 그랬다. 조(매형이름)에게도 역시 무척 다루기 힘든 문제였을 것이다. 하지만 조는 이런 형이상학적인 영역에서 내 문제의 본질을 단번에 끄집어내어 그(조) 특유의 방법으로 내 문제들을 무찔러버렸다. “네가 확실히 해둘  것이  하나  있단다,  핍”  조가  잠깐 생각에 잠긴 후 내게 얘기를 들려주었다. “다시 말해 거짓말들은 거짓말들일 뿐이 란다. 아무리 사정이  그랬어도  거짓말을  해서는  안 되었어. 거짓말은 또 다른 거짓말을 낳으니까 거짓말은 더 큰 거짓말 안에서 맴돌 뿐이 란다. 핍, 이후 다시는 거짓말을 하지 말거라. 그건 너 같은 소년이 문 제를 푸는 방법이 될 수 없어. 이 친구야, 네가 평범하다니 그게 무슨 말이니. 나는 그 애가 했다는 평범하다는 말의 의미를 전혀 모르겠구 나.  넌  어떤 문제들에  대해선  비범하게  뛰어난 아이란다.  키도 비범하게 작잖니. 더욱이 넌 비범하게 학자답기도 해.”\\n“아냐, 난 무식하고 덜 떨어진 아이야, 조.”\\n\\u3000“왜, 어젯밤에는 내게 편지도 써주었잖니! 심지어 그걸 활자체(인쇄에 쓰는 글자모양)로 썼잖니! 내 평생 지체 높으신 양반들의 편지를 눈 으로 수도 없이 보아왔지만 맹세하건데 너처럼 편지를 활자체로 쓰는 사람은  없었단다. 암!”\\n\\u3000“난 하나도 안 배운 거랑 다름없어. 조. 날 너무 높이 평가하지 마. 그게(어설프게 편지 쓸 정도가) 다라고.”\\n\\u3000“글쎄다, 핍.” 조가 말했다. “그게 중요하던 중요하지 않던, 비범한 학자가 되기 위해선 먼저 평범한 학자가 되어야하지 않니. 난 네가 반 드시 비범한 학자가 되리라고 믿는다. 왕관을 쓴 왕도 왕관을  쓰기  전 에 배워두지 못했다면 의회에 출석하셔서 활자체로 칙령(명령)을 쓰실   순 없었지 않겠니. 왕자님이셨을 때부터 차근차근 배우신 거지. 알파벳부터 말이다. 앗!” 조가 갖가지 생각들로 가득 찬 자신의  머리를  세차게 흔들면서 이런 말을 덧붙였다. “그래 ‘에이’부터 시작하셨을 거다.  그래 역시 그랬을 거야. 그러다가 ‘제트’까지 마치신거지. 내가 비록 알파벳을 다 베우진 못했지만 모든 일이 디 그렇지 않나 싶단다.”\\n\\u3000조의 그런 말들 속에는 내 기분(비참함)을 다소 누그러트리는 어떤  희망 같은 것이 있었다. 나는 다소 기분이 좋아졌다.\\n\\u3000“직업이나 수입에 관한 한 말이다, 핍. 평범한 사람들이,” 조가 생각에 잠기더니 자신의 말을 계속 뒤쫓아 가며 말했다. “비범한 사람들과 놀러 나가는 것보단 평범한 사람들과 계속 친목을 유지하며 잘 지내는 것이 훨씬 더 나은지 안 나은지 하는 문제…(←디킨스가 대사를 통해 말하고 있는 이 소설의 주제임. 즉 『 위대한 유산 』 의 주제는 ”행복은, 일생에 한 번 있을까 말까하는 큰 요행을 얻는 것에 있는 것이 아니라, 진실함 온건함 완전함으로 맺어진, 소중한 사람들과의 인간관계에 있다.” 쉽지 않은 문제지만 작지만 소중한  인간관계를  형성해나가는 것이 중요한 것 같네요. 동감~), 가만 있자, 그건 그렇고 깃발은 (미스 해비샴의 방 안에) 있지 않았니? 아마…?”\\n“없었어요,  조.” \\n\\u3000“이런, 유감인데 깃발이 하나도 없었다니 말이다, 핍. 어느 게 더 좋고 더 안 좋은지는 지금 따질 수 없단다. 그랬다간 일  안하고 쓸데없는 생각에 빠져  있다고  네 누나가 난폭해질  거니까. 그리고  네 고민들 은 일부러 더 생각해 볼 것도 없구나. 잘 들어봐라, 핍, 네 진정한 친구가 말하는 것을, 그 진정한 친구가 너에게 해주고 싶은 말을 이거란다. 만약 네가 착하게 살아도 비범한 사람이 될 수 없다면, 네가 나쁘게 살아도 비범한 사람이 될 순 없는 거란다. 그러니 이 친구야, 다시는 거짓말을 하지 마라. 잘 살다가 행복한 죽음을 맞이해야지, 안 그러니, 핍?”\\n“나한테 화 안나,  조?”  (조는  착하지만  많이  어리숙한  매형이름) “전혀, 이 친구야. 하지만 네가 한 거짓말들이 놀랍고 너무 대담해\\n내가 두 손 두 발 다 들었다는 사실을 기억해둬, 네가 늘 잘되기를 바라는 어느 거짓 없는 사람이 방금 들려준 얘기들도 꼭 기억해두고. 자,   네 방에 올라가기 전에 계단 있잖니 계단 오를 때 네 머릿속에 방금 얘기 ‘풍덩’ 알지? 이것으로 끝. 그러니까 이 친구야, 다시는 거짓말을 하지 말거라.”\\n\\u3000내 작은 다락방으로 올라가며 난 기도했다. 그래 조(매형이름)의 충고를 잊지 말자. 하지만 내 어린 마음은 어떤 면에선 이미 불안으로 요동치고 있었고 고마움을 전혀 모르는 상태였다.\\n\\u3000자리에 누워서도 한 참을 생각해야했다. ‘겨우 대장장이일 뿐인 조 (매형)를 에스텔라는 얼마나 천하게 생각할까? 조의 그 두꺼운 부츠와 거친 두 손을 만약 그녀가 본다면 얼마나 비웃을까?’라고.\\n\\u3000나는 또 생각했었다. ‘지금 조와 누나는 부엌에 어떤 식으로 앉아 있 을까? 그리고 난 부엌에서 내 다락방으로 어떻게 올라왔을까? 그리고 미스 해비샴과 에스텔라는 절대 부엌에 앉아 본 적이 없겠지? 그런 상류 사회 인사들이 그런 천한 행동을 할 리가 없겠지?’라고.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴의 저택에서 오늘 내가 했었던 모든 일들을 다시 생각해 보다가 이내 잠이 들었다. 마치 내가 거기에 수주 혹은 수개월동안 있다 온 것만 같았다. 그 일이 마치 오늘 일어난 일이 아니라 아주 오래된 내 추억의 한 조각인 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000그 날(처음으로 미스 해비샴의 저택에 출입하고, 처음으로 에스텔라를 만난 것)은 내게 중요한 날이었다. 그 일로 인해 난 엄청난 변화를 겪어야했기 때문이다. 하지만 그건 어느 누구의 삶에서도 마찬가지일 것이다. 만약 자기 인생에서 어느 특정한 날 하루가 지워진다고 생각 해보라, 그리고 이후 그가 걸어야했을 인생 항로가 얼마나 달라져 있 을까를 한 번 생각해보라.\\n\\u3000이 글을 읽고 있는 여러분들도 잠시 멈추고 생각해보라. 왕관과 화초(꽃)로 모양을 낸 그 긴 사슬, 철과 황금으로 모양을 낸 그 “잠깐 동안의 긴 사슬”이 당신을 결코 묶지 못했을 거라는 사실을 말이다. 하지만 기억할 만한 바로 그 날 그 첫 번째 고리가 연결되었다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 10장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000하루나 이틀이 더 지난 어느 날 아침 내가 잠에서 깨어났을 때, 이 상황에 딱 맞아 떨어지는 기가 막힌 아이디어 하나가 떠올랐다. 내 자신을 비범하게 만들 수 있는 최선의 길은 다름 아닌 비디(대고모가 운 영하는 저녁학교에서 마을 아이들에게 간단한 철자나 산수를 가리켜 주거나 잡화점에서 물건을 파는 항상 볼품없는 옷을 입고 다니지만 일 요일 교회예배에 갈 때는 예쁘게 단장하고 가는 많이 안 예쁜  아가씨, 다만 마음은 천사,  소설 속  여자조연, 여자주인공 아님-_- 헷갈리시면 안 됨)에게서 그녀가 가지고 있는 모든 지식을 주입받는 것이다.\\n\\u3000어둠속에서 밝게 빛난 이 실낱같은  희망을 실행에 옮기기 위해  ‘웹슬 씨의 대고모’(대고모 : 웹슬 씨의 아버지의 고모)가 운영하는 저녁 학교에 간 날 비디에게 말했다. 내게는 인생에서 성공해야만 할 특별한 이유가 있다는 것을, 그리고 그녀의 모든 지식을 내게 전수해달라고 지금 이렇게 간청하고 있는지를 모두 설명했다. 비디는 또래 아이들 중 가장 책임을 질 줄 아는 소녀였다. 비디가 즉석에서 승낙했다. 그로부터 딱 5분도 안 되어 비디는 정말로 자신의 말을 실천하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000‘웹슬 씨의 대고모’가 만들어놓은 교육방침이니 과정을 이 자리에서 굳이 설명하자면 다음과 같이 간략히 정리할 수 있다.\\n\\u3000학생들은 사과를 먹거나 지푸라기들을 다른 아이들의 등에 집어넣는다. 자 그럼, 웹슬 씨의 대고모가 에너지를 모아선 자작나무 회초리를 들고 아이들에게로 다가가 비틀거리며 휘두른다.\\n\\u3000이 습격(매)을 온갖 조롱으로 받아낸 후, 학생들은 가지런히 줄지어 늘어서선 손에서 손으로 ‘누더기가 다 된 책’을 이어 던지며 웅성대었다. 그 책에는 알파벳과, 숫자 약간, 그리고 표들이 몇 개 들어가 있었다. 맞춤법 같은 것도 조금 있었던 것 같다. 다시 말해, 그런 것들이 지금 있다는 것이 아니라 과거 언젠가 그런 비슷한 내용이 책에 있었다는 것이다.\\n\\u3000이 책이 아이들의 손에서 손으로 한 바퀴를 다 돌고나면, ‘웹슬 씨의 대고모’는 곧바로 혼수상태에 빠지셨는데, 아마 잠이 드셨거나 아님 ‘류머티즘에 기인한 발작’(몸이 단단히 굳어지고 아파 움직이지 못하는 증세) 증세 때문에 혼수상태에 빠지신 것일 게다.\\n\\u3000그러면 학생들은 누가 상대방의 발가락을 가장 힘껏 밟을 수 있느냐를 정할 속셈으로 서로 경쟁적으로 서로의 발가락을 밟아 댔고, 이게 그들이 말하는 부츠(구두)를 주제로 한 조사였다.\\n\\u3000비디(여선생님)가 학생들 사이로  뛰어들어  바닥에  나뒹구는 성경책 세 권을  주워 담아야지만 이 미친 짓(학생들이 서로 상대방의 발을 세차게 밟는 것)이 멈추었다. 성경책이 어찌나 많이 떨어져나갔던지 뭔지 모를 것에서 끝만 두툼하게 칼로 도려낸 것 같았다. 아주 서툴게 말이다.\\n\\u3000말이 나왔으니 말이지 이 성경책들의 인쇄상태 또한 대단히 열악해서 내가 이후 접한 어떤 다른 어려운 문학서적보다도 최고조로 판독하기 어려웠다. 성경책 속 글자 주위에는 어김없이 얼룩덜룩한 잉크가 번져있었고 낱장(종이)과 낱장 사이에는 언제나 납작하게 찌부러진 각 양각색의 곤충 견본들로  가득했다.\\n\\u3000수업은 대개 비디(여선생님)가 몇몇 골통 녀석들과 1대 1 결투를 벌 이고 난 뒤에야 시작되곤 했다. 보통은 그랬다. 일단 이런 몇 차례의 1대 1 결투가 끝나면 비디가 오늘 읽을 쪽 수를 말했고, 그럼 우리들은 읽을 수 있는 부분을 지독한 코러스(후렴구)까지 넣어가며 질러댔다. 사실 읽을 수 없는 부분이 더 많았지만 어쨌든 질러댔다.\\n\\u3000비디가 높고 단조로우며 새된 목소리로 우리를 이끌었지만 사실 우리들 중에 누구도 우리가 읽는 책(성경책)에 담긴 개념이나 존경 같은 건 없었다.\\n\\u3000이런 불쾌한 소음이 얼마간 지속되고 나면 ‘웹슬 씨의 대고모’가 기계적으로 깨어났는데 그럼 그녀는 가장 먼저 발견한 소년의 모습에 깜짝 놀라 그 녀석의 두 귀를 잡아 땅겼고, 그럼 우리들은 저녁수업의 끝으로 받아들이고 지적 승리의 환호성을 지르며 밖으로 뛰어나왔다.\\n\\u3000교실에 석판(글 쓰는 석판)을 들고 오지 말라거나 혹은 잉크를 사용 하지 말라는 어떠한 금지조항도 없었다는 것이 적당한 말이지만 사실 가지고 올 잉크도  없었다.\\n\\u3000그건 그렇다고 쳐도 겨울철에 이곳에서 공부를 계속한다는 건 보통 어려운 일이 아니었는데, 다름 아니라 그곳에는 어떠한 양초 심지 절단용 가위도 없었고 녹인 초에 심지를 담가 다시 초로 만든 촛불 하나가 영 풀이 죽은 채 방 전체를 희미하게 비추고 있을 뿐이었기 때문이다. 그러니까 교실로 사용되던 그 작은 잡화점(가게)이 실은 ‘웹슬 씨 대고모의 거실’이고 침실이었던  것이다.\\n\\u3000상황(주변 여건이 공부할 상황이 전혀 아니니)이 이러하니 내가 비범한 사람이 되기 위해선 엄청난 시간이 걸릴 것만 같이 느껴졌다. 하지만 난 해내기로 결심했고, 비디(고아, 여선생님)는 그날 저녁부터 나와 맺은 특별협정(개인교습)을 이행하기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 가격목록 표에 있는 정보 그러니까 습당(정제하기 전의 설 탕)이라는 항목 아래에 있는 일부 정보들을  전수해 주었다. 그리고 집에 가져가 베껴 쓰라며 어떤 신문 제목에서 그녀가 직접 따라 그린 ‘고대영어대문자 디’(글자 주변에 수많은 곡선들과 잎을 그려 넣어 그림같이 보이는 글자체)를 내게 건네주었다. 나는, 비디가 내게 그 문자의 의미를 말해주기 전에는 허리띠에 달린 쇠를 디자인한 것인 줄 알았다.\\n\\u3000당연한 얘기지만 우리 마을에도 술집이 한 군데 있었다. 더 당연한 얘기겠지만 조(주인공의 매형, 선량하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물)는 이따금씩 그 술집에서 자신의 파이프 담배를 피우길 좋아했다.\\n\\u3000난 매일 저녁이면 ‘세 명의 쾌활한 바지선선원들’(바지선=화물선)에 들러 조를 집으로 데리고 오라는 엄명을 누나로부터 받은 상태였던 지라, 그날 저녁에도 학교를 마치자마자 집으로 향하기 전 조를 데리고 나오기 위해 ‘세 명의 쾌활한 바지선선원들’(술집)로 걸음을 옮겼다.\\n\\u3000‘세 명의 쾌활한 바지선선원들’이란 술집에는 바(스탠드)가 하나 있 었다. 바 안에 있는 문 옆 벽 위에는 놀랄 정도로 기다란 분필 자국들이 술값이라며 표시되어 있었는데 말이야 바른 말이지 내가 보기엔 영 원히 갚을 수 없을 술값으로만 보였다. 그 분팔 자국들은 심지어 내가 기억이란 걸 하기 전부터 그 곳에 있었는데 어찌된 것이 내가 성장속 도보다 더 빠르게 성장했다. 하지만 우리 시골 주변에는 석회석이 엄청나게 많았고 그래서 아마 사람들은 분필을 활용할 기회를 조금도 회 피하지  않았던 모양이다.\\n\\u3000술집주인이 벽 위에 있는 분필자국들(술값)을 아주 잔인한 얼굴로 바라보고 있었다. 아마 토요일 밤이라서 그런 모양이다.  (외상이 빠르 게 느니까.^^ㅋㅋ) 내 볼 일은 조(주인공의 매형, 선량하지만 많이 어 리숙한 인물)에게 있었지 그(술집주인)에게 있지 않았기 때문에 나는 간단히 “안녕하세요.”란 말만 건네곤 바로 통로 맨 끝에 있는 휴게실로 향했다.\\n\\u3000휴게실에는 밝고 커다란 부엌난로가 놓여있었다. 당연히 조(매형)는 그곳에 있었다. 파이프 담배를 문 채 말이다. 조는 일행이 있었는데 친 구인 ‘웹슬 씨’(교회서기, 소설 속 엑스트라)와 그리고 내가 처음 보는 얼굴인 어떤 낮선  사나이였다.\\n\\u3000조가 평소와 같이 “어이, 핍, 여기야  친구!”라며  반겨주었다.  조가 그런 말을 건네자마자 그 낮선 사나이가 고개를 돌리고선 줄곧 나를 뚫어지게 쳐다보았다.\\n\\u3000그는 어딘가 비밀스러워 보이는 인물이었다. 그의 고개는 한쪽으로 완전히 기울어져있었고 한 쪽 눈도 반쯤은 감긴 상태였다. 마치 보이지 않는 총을 가지고 무언가를 겨누고 있는 것만 같이 느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000그는 입에 파이프  담배를 물고 있었다. 파이프 담배를 입에서  빼더니 담배 연기를 휴우 하고 공중으로 흩날렸다. 그러는 사이에도 내게 향한 시선을 떼지  않았다.\\n\\u3000그가 나를 보며 고개를 끄떡였다. 그래서 나도 고개를 끄떡여보였다. 그런 후 그가 다시 고개를 끄떡였고 내가 앉을 수 있도록 자기 옆자리를 내어주었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 나(남자주인공)는 휴게실(술집 휴게실)에 들를 때마다 조(남자조연, 주인공의 매형, 선량하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물) 옆에 가 앉아 있곤 했기 때문에 그 낮선 사나이(엑스트라, 소설 앞부분에서 주인공이 빵을 건네다준 죄수의 동료)에게 “실례하겠습니다, 어르신.”이라고 거 절한 후 조 옆에 가 앉았다. 그러고 보니 내가 앉은 자리가 공교롭게도 낮선 사나의 맞은편이  되었다.\\n\\u3000낮선 사나이가 조를 흘끗 보았다. 조가 다른 일에 열중해 있는 것을 확인하곤 나에게 또 고개를 끄떡여보였다. 그것도 내가 자리에 가 앉자마자 말이다. 그런 다음 그 사나이는 자기 다리를 톱으로 쓸 것처럼 비볐다. 그건 아주 독특한 방식이었는데 그 순간 나는 깜짝 놀랐다. 그의 행동이 나로 하여금 누군가(남자주연, 소설 앞부분에서 주인공이 빵을 건네다준 죄수)를 떠올리게 했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“그러니까 당신이,” 낮선 사나이가 조에게로 고개를 돌리며 말했다. “그러니까 당신이 대장장이란  말씀이시죠?”\\n“예. 제가 대장장이입니다. 잘 아시잖소.” 조가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“뭘 시키시겠습니까, 성함이…? 말이 났으니 말인데 괜찮겠소? 제가 당신 이름을 막  불러도?”\\n\\u3000조가 막 자기 이름을 가르쳐주자 낮선 사나이가 조의 이름을 편하게 부르며 이렇게 말했다. “뭘로 하겠소. 가저리 씨? 술은 제가 쏘죠? 마지막 잔이니 말이오?”\\n\\u3000“좋습니다.” 조가 말했다. “솔직히 말씀드려, 전 제 돈으로 마시는 술이 아닌 남이 사주는 술은 많이 마시지 않는 습관이 있습니다.”\\n\\u3000“버릇이겠죠? 아니오?” 낮선 사나이가 되받아쳤다. “이따금씩은 괜 찮지 않소. 더욱이 오늘은 토요일 밤이고. 자! 그러고 보니 당신의 버릇을 먼저 알고 당신의 이름을 나중에서야 듣게 되었군요. 가저리 씨.” “전 경직된 사람이 되고 싶진 않습니다,” 조가 말했다. “그럼 럼주(술)로 하죠.”\\n\\u3000“이 분에게 럼주를!” 낮선 사나이가 주문을 넣었다. “자 다른 신사 분께서도 뭐로 하실지  말씀해주셔야죠.”\\n\\u3000“그럼  저도 럼주로 하겠습니다.” 웹슬  씨(비중이 극히 작은 남자조연, 연극배우를 꿈꾸는 교회서기)가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“여기 럼주 세 잔!” 낮선 사나이가 술집주인을 부르며 소리쳤다. “어서 잔을 돌리시오,  주인장.”\\n\\u3000“이 분은,” 조가 웹슬 씨를 소개하며 말했다. “이 분은 당신에게도 들려주고 싶을 만큼 낭독을 잘하시는 분이십니다. 저희 교회의 서기이 시죠.”\\n\\u3000“아하!” 낮선 사나이가 눈으로 나를 또 ‘꼭’ 집으며 재빨리 탄성을 내질렀다. “늪지대 오른편에 외따로 서있는 그 교회말씀이시죠, 주변에 수많은  무덤들이 있는!”\\n“예, 바로 그 교회입니다.” 조가 말했다. \\n\\u3000파이프담배를 물고서 일종의 “꿀꿀”거리는 소리를 내던 낮선 사나이가 자신이 다 차지하고 있던 의자 위로 두 다리를 편안하게 얹었다. 그는 테두리가 넓은 여행용 모자를 쓰고 있었는데, 모자 쓰는 방식처럼 손수건을 접어 머리 위에 얹어놓고 있었는데 그 바람에 그의 머리 카락이 하나도 보이지 않았다. 벽난로를 쳐다보고 있던 그의 얼굴에서 뭔가 교활한 표정을 내가 본 것 같았다. 그가 반쯤 웃을 때 어떤 교활한 표정이 얼굴 전체로  번져갔다.\\n\\u3000“저는 이 시골에 일면식도 없습니다, 신사 분들. 하지만 이 시골은  꼭 강을 향해 외따로 있는 것 같더군요.”\\n“늪지대가 그렇죠.” 조가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“아마, 틀림없이 지금도 그곳엔 떠도는 집시들이 있겠죠? 부랑자들 이라든가 떠돌이들 같은 것들 말입니다.”\\n\\u3000“전혀요.” 조가 말했다. “이따금씩 나타나는 탈옥수들 외엔 아무도 없습니다. 그리고 우리가 그들을 발견하는 건 쉽지도 않고요. 그렇죠, 웹슬 씨?”\\n\\u3000웹슬 씨는 지난번에 추격대를 따라나섰다가 힘들어서 죽다 살아난 기억을 장렬하게 회상하곤 조의 말에 정말 건성으로 동의를 표했다.\\n\\u3000“그런 추격에 나서 본 적이 있는 모양이시군요?” 낮선 사나이가 물었다.\\n\\u3000“딱 한 번 있었죠.” 조가 대답했다. “하지만 저희들이 죄수를 추적한 것은 아니었습니다. 잘 아시겠지만, 저흰 구경하러 간 거였죠. 여기 있는 웹슬 씨와 핍이랑 같이요. 그렇지, 핍?”\\n“응, 조.” (조는 매형이름, 핍은 남자주인공 이름 아직은 꼬마)\\n그  낮선  사나이가  나에게로  눈을  돌렸다.  한  쪽  눈을  지그시 감은 채였는데 꼭 보이지 않는 총구멍으로 나를 겨누고 있다는 사실을 내게 재확인시켜주고 싶어 하는 것 같았다. 낮선 사나이가 말했다. “아주 똘 똘해 보이는 녀석이군요. 그래 이 애 이름이 뭐라고 하셨죠?”\\n“핍입니다.” 조(핍의 매형이름)가 말했다. “세례명이 핍인가요?”\\n“아뇨, 세례명은 핍이 아닙니다.” “그럼 이 아이의 성이 핍인가요?”\\n\\u3000“아닙니다.” 조가 말했다.  “우리들끼리만 부르는 이름이죠. 얘가  어릴 적 뭐 지금도 어리지만 자기 이름을 제대로 발음하지 못해 자기를 핍이라고 불렀죠.”\\n“당신 아들이오?”\\n\\u3000“글쎄요.” 조가 명상에 잠기더니 그렇게 말했다. 물론 그 질문에 대해 명상에 잠길 필요가 있었던 것이 아니다. 다만 파이프담배를 물고서 토론하는 모든 것들에 대해 일단 질문을 받게 되면 그렇게 깊이 생각하는 것처럼 보이는 것이 이 '세 명의 쾌활한 바지선 선원들'(술집이름) 스타일이었기 때문이다. 조가 말했다. “글쎄요. 음. 아니, 아닙니다. 제 아들이  아닙니다.”\\n“그럼 조카입니까?” 낮선 사나이가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“글쎄요.” 조가 좀 전과 같이 엄청 심사숙고 한 다음 이렇게 말했다.  “이 얘는 제 조카가 아닙니다. 아니, 당신을 속일 수는 없습니다. 이애는 제 조카가  아닙니다.”\\n\\u3000“이런 젠장 그럼 이 애가 뭐란 말이오?” 낮선 사나이가 분통을 터트리며 말했다. 내가 봤을 땐 그(낮선 사나이)가 필요이상으로 열을 내고 묻고 있는 것  같았다.\\n\\u3000그러자 웹슬 씨가 급하게 끼어들었다. 왜냐하면 그는 남자가 결혼하지 말아야할 여자관계에 대해 빠삭하게 알고 있던 교회서기였기 때문이다. 웹슬 씨가 나와 조의 관계에 대해 소상히 설명해주었다.\\n\\u3000모든 설명을 마친 웹슬 씨가 「 리처드 3세 」 (셰익스피어의 희곡, 리처드 3세는 15세기 말 영국의 사악한 군주, 조선의 세조와 비슷함)에 나오는 구절 하나를 굉장히 으르렁거리는 소리로 낭독하는 것으로 자  신의 설명을 마쳤다. 그리고 설명이 충분했다고 스스로도 여겼는지 이런 말을 끝에 덧붙이는 센스도 보여주었다. “시인이 전해준 말에 따르면  그와 같습니다.”\\n\\u3000나는 이 부분에서 꼭 얘기해두고 싶다. 웹슬 씨는 나에 대해 설명하 면서 내 머리를 손으로 구겨 내 머리카락이 내 눈을 쑤시게 하는 것이  웹슬 씨 자신의 설명에서 중요한 한 부분인 양 행동하더라는 것이다.  웹슬 씨뿐만이 아니라 그때 당시 우리 집에 들렀던 그와 비슷한 위치(지위)에 있던 사람들이 하나같이 그와 같은 행동을 해 나를 자극했는지 지금도 그 이유를 알 수 없다.\\n\\u3000기억에  떠오르기를, 내가 심지어 그때보다 더 어렸을 때도 우리 집에서 벌어졌던 사교모임의 주제가 내가 될 때면 꼭 큰 손바닥을 가진 누군가가 나를 후원하겠다는 양 그와 같은 안과조치들(주인공의 머리를 손으로 구겨서 머리카락이 눈을 찌르게 하기)을 취했었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000이 오랫동안 내내, 낮선 사나이의 시선은 다른 누구도 아닌 내게로 고정되어 있었다. 이젠 정말 마지막 한 방을 쏘아서라도 나를 떨어뜨리고 말겠다는 듯이 나를 쳐다보고 있었다. 하지만 “이런 젠장”이란 욕설을 내뱉고 난 후론 그는 아무 말도 하지 않고 있었다. 그러니까  럼주에 물을 탄 것이 나왔을 때까지 말이다. 럼주가 나오자 그가 발사를 했다. 그것도 가장 특이한 한 방식의 발사였다.\\n\\u3000그것은 구두 발언이 아니라 순차적으로 행해진 무언의 동작이었다. 그것은 나를 신랄하게 지목한 행동이었다. 그는 나를 비난하듯이 물탄 럼주를 휘저었다. 그리고 나를 힐난하듯이 물탄 럼주의 맛을 보는 것 이다. 그리고 그가 다시 물탄 럼주를 휘젓더니 맛을 보았다. 그건 그에   게 서비스된 스푼이 아니었다. 그건 바로 말 그대로 대장간에서 사용하는 줄(쇠를 자르는 대장간  도구)이었다.\\n\\u3000그가 이런 식으로 그 일을 했기 때문에 나를 제외하고는 아무도 그  줄을 본  사람은 없었다. 물탄 럼주를 마저 휘저은 후 줄을 닦더니 자기 가슴 안주머니에 그 줄을 집어넣었다. 그 도구(줄)를 보는 순간 난 직감했다. ‘저건 조(매형)의 줄이라는 사실을. 그리고 저 사람이 내 죄 수를  안다는 사실을.’\\n\\u3000내가 넋을 놓고 그를 바라보며 앉아 있자, 그는 이제 나에게는 눈길도 주지 않고 자기 의자에 깊숙이 기대앉은 채 주로 순무우(먹는 무) 들에 관한 얘기를  했다.\\n\\u3000우리 마을에는 토요일 밤이면 한 주일을 새로 시작하기 전에 잠시 멈추고 청소나 정리를 하는 달콤한 의식이 있었다. 그래서인지 조(매형, 대장장이)는 다른 날에 비해 토요일엔 감히 누나를 염두에 두지 않고 30분이나  더 앉아 있는 만용을 보이곤 했다. 30분이 자나 물탄 럼주가 다 떨어지자 조가 가려고 내 손을 잡고 일어섰다.\\n\\u3000“잠시만 기다리시오, 가저리 씨(매형 이름).” 낮선 사나이가 말했다. “내 생각에 호주머니에 2만 원짜리 새 지폐 한 장을 넣고 온 것 같소,  만약 그게 아직도 내 호주머니에 있다면, 그걸 이 꼬마에게 주고 싶소.”\\n\\u3000그가 호주머니에서 동전을  한  움큼  꺼내더니  지폐를  찾았다.  지폐 한 장이 쭈글쭈글 구겨진 채 동전 사이에 껴있었다. “네 것이다!” 그가 말했다. “명심해라! 이건 네  것이다.”\\n\\u3000나는 바른 예의의 범위를 한 참 벗어난 채 그를 빤히 쳐다보며 “감 사합니다.”란 인사말을 한 후 조의 손을 꽉 붙잡았다.\\n\\u3000그가 조에게 “잘 가시오”란 인사를 건넸다. 웹슬 씨(교회서기)도 우 리와 함께 나왔다. 그는 웹슬 씨에게도 “잘 가시오”라는 인사말을 건넸다. 그의 겨냥하는 눈이 나를 한 번 흘낏 보았다. 아니, 아니 쳐다본게 아니다. 왜냐하면 그의 눈이 감겨 있었기 때문이다. 하지만 놀라운 일들이란 한쪽 눈을 감은 채로도 충분히 행해질 수 있다.\\n\\u3000집으로 돌아오는 길에, 내게 만약 유머를 즐길 기분이 있었다면 우리들의 모든 대화는 내가 했을 것이다. 말 많은 웹슬 씨(교회서기)도  ‘세 명의 쾌활한 바지선 선원들’(술집이름) 문 앞에서 우리와  헤어졌겠다, 그리고 조(매형, 대장장이)는 지금 집으로 가는 내내 럼주를 가능한 한 말끔히 씻어내기 위해 많은 밤공기로 들어 마시기 위해 입을 크게 벌린 채로 걷고 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 난 내 오랜 비행(집에서 빵을 훔쳐 죄수에게 건네 준 것)과  내 옛 지인이 나타난 것에 그만 얼이 나가 이거고 저거고 간에 도무지  말할  기분이 아니었다.\\n\\u3000우리가 부엌에 출몰했을 때 누나(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)의 기분은 아주 나쁜 상태는 아니었다. 이런 유별난 상황에 흥이 났는지 조 (주인공의 매형)가 누나(주인공의 누나)에게 2만 원짜리 지폐 얘기를 꺼냈다.\\n\\u3000“위조지폐 아냐? 내 장담하지.”라며 ‘조 부인’(주인공의 누나)이 의 기양양하게 말했다. “아니면 그 사람이 이 딴 꼬마 녀석에게 2만원을 왜 줬겠어! 한 번 봐봐.”\\n\\u3000내가 종이를 건네주었고 조 부인의 정밀 점검 결과 그 지폐는 진짜로 판명 났다. “에구머니나 이게 뭐람?” 조 부인이 지폐를 불빛에 비춰보다 말고 깜짝 놀라 말했다. “이거 50만 원짜리 수표 두 장 아냐?”\\n\\u3000그야말로 50만 원짜리 수표 딱 두 장이었다. 그것도 읍내에 있는 가 축시장이란 가축시장은 다 돌아다니며 온갖 친밀한 계약과정엔 다 참여했을 것 같은 수표였다. 땀에 흠뻑 젖은 두 장의 수표였다.\\n\\u3000조(매형)가 급히 모자를 다시 챙겨 쓰고 ‘세 명의 쾌활한 바지선선원 들’(술집이름)로 뛰어갔다. 수표의 원주인에게 돌려주기 위해서였다.  조가 술집으로 뛰어간 동안, 나는 내 전용 의자(등받이가 없는 의자)에 앉아 내 누나만 멍청히 바라보고 있었다. 나는 그 낮선 사나이가 벌써 술집에 없을 거라고 강한 확신이 들었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000곧 조(매형이름)가 돌아왔다. 그 남성이 가버리고 없더라는 것이다. 그래서 조는 그 사나이가 아니라 술집주인에 수표와 관한 말을 남기고 돌아왔다고 했다.\\n\\u3000그때 누나가 수표 두 장을 종이로 감싸 봉한 채, 그것을 응접실에 있는 찬장(가구)  위에 있는 장식용 찻주전자 안에 집어넣었다. 누나는 그 위에 다시 마른 장미 이파리 두 장을 얹어놓은 후 안심했다. 그 수표 두 장은 수많은 밤과 낮 동안 내게 악몽인 채로 그 장소에 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 잠자리에 들었을 때 난 산산조각 난 잠이 들었고, 보이지 않는 총으로 나를 겨누고 있을 낮선 사나이에 대한 생각과 죄수들과 비밀스 러운 음모 관계였다는 꺼림칙한 상스러움과 그것이 저속한 짓이라는 생각이 밤새 나를 괴롭혔기 때문이다. 이것은 내가 이전에는 잊고 있었던 내 밝지 않은 경력의 한 얼굴이다. 줄(쇠를 자르는 대장간 도구, 주인공이 죄수에게 건네준 것)에 관한 생각도 나를 불안에 떨게 한 요 소들 중 하나였다. 내가 가장 예측하지 못할 때 줄(쇠를 자르는 대장간 도구)이 다시 나타나리라는 불안이 나를 완전히 사로잡아버린 밤이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그나마 다음 주 수요일이면 미스 해비샴의 저택에 간다는 생각으로 나를 구슬리며 잠이 들 수 있었다. 꿈속에서 나는 문에서부터 내게로 다가오고 있는 줄을 보았고 누가 그 줄을 들고 있는지 볼 수 없었다. 나는 비명을 지르며 잠에서 깼다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 11장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000지정된 시간에 나(주인공, 아직은 꼬마)는 미스  해비샴의 저택으로 다시 갔다. 멈칫거리며 종을 누르자 에스텔라(주인공 또래의 소녀)가 문까지  나와 주었다.\\n\\u3000내가 안으로 들어서자 그녀가 지난번처럼 문을 잠갔다. 그녀가 앞장 서며 나를 어두운 통로 쪽으로 안내했다. 통로 입구에 촛불이 놓여있 었는데 그 촛불을 집어들 때까지 에스텔라는 나를 철저히 무시하는 눈치였다.\\n\\u3000어깨 너머로 나를 대충 훑어보던  그녀가  건방진  목소리로  말했다. “넌 오늘 이쪽 길로 가야해.” 그러더니 나를 저택의 또 다른 길로 안 내했다. 전과는 완전히 딴 쪽이었다.\\n\\u3000복도는 아주 길었고 ‘매너 하우스’(‘영주의 대저택’이란 뜻)의 사각형 모양 지하층 전체에 고루 펼쳐져있는 것 같았다. 하지만 우리는 그 사각형의 한쪽만 횡단한 것이었다. 그녀가 복도 끝에서 멈춰 섰다. 그녀가 촛불을 내려놓은 후 문을 열었다.\\n\\u3000이리로(여기로) 햇빛이 다시 나타났다. 내가 포장된 작은 안뜰에 서 있다는 사실을 알게 되었다. 안뜰 맞은편에 외따로 떨어진 주택이 하나 서 있었다. 아마 한때는 ‘문을 닫은 맥주공장’의 감독이나 주임이 사용하던  건물 같았다.\\n\\u3000그 주택의 바깥벽에 시계가 하나 달려 있었다. “미스 해비샴의 방에 있던 시계”와 “미스 해비샴의 손목시계”처럼 그 시계도 정확하게 9시 20분을 가리킨 채 멈춰서  있었다.\\n\\u3000우리는 문 쪽으로 갔다. 문은 열려 있었다. 1층 뒤쪽에 있는 방이었고, 천정이 낮고 어두운 방이었다. 이미 몇몇 일행이 방안에 자리잡고 있었다(손님들이  몇몇 있었다).\\n\\u3000그들과 합류하면서 에스텔라가 내게 말했다. “넌 저쪽에 가서 부를 때까지 서 있어, 이 꼬마야.”\\n\\u3000그녀가 말한 “저쪽” 그러니까 창가에 서 있기 위해 난 방을 가로질러 가 “저쪽”에 서 있었다. 나는 아주 불안정한 심리상태였다. 그래서 밖을 내다봤다.\\n\\u3000공터가 넓게 펼쳐져 있었다. 방치된 정원에서도 가장 보잘 것 없는 구석을 주의 깊게 들여다보았다. 거기(구석)엔 양배추 줄기들이 부패한 채 엉망으로 널려 있었고, 아주 오래전에 짧게 깎인 것 같은 회양목(우 리나라 아파트  단지 도로 옆에 둥글게 가지와 잎을 잘라 놓은 것, 크게 자라면 7m까지도 자라는데-_-;;) 한 그루도 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000그러고 보니 회양목이 꼭 푸딩(서양과자)처럼 생겼다. 짧게 깎인 회 양목 위에 다시 새로운 회양목이 자라서 형태도 제각각 색깔도 제각각이 된 회양목이었다. 마치 푸딩 덩어리가 냄비에서 안 나겠다고 자기 고집만 부리려다가 불에 홀딱 타버린 것 같았다. 이것은 내가 회양목을 바라보며 가졌던 내 속 편한 생각이었다.\\n\\u3000밤새도록 눈이 적게 내렸었다. 내가 알기로는 읍 어디에도 눈은 남아있지 않았다. 그런데 눈이 이쪽 정원 구석의 춥고 그늘진  곳에 아직 녹지 않은 채  남아있었다.\\n\\u3000바람이 작은 소용돌이를 일으키며 그 눈들을 휘감아 내가 있는 창 쪽으로 내던지며 나를 바보취급 했는데, 마치 눈과 바람이 내가 자기들을 본 것에 대한 화풀이로 나를 녹여버리려는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000내 출현(등장)이 방안의 대화를 끊었다는 사실과 방안의 점유자들(손 님들)이 하나같이 나를 주시하고 있다는 사실을 난 곧 간파했다(직감적으로 알았다).\\n\\u3000내가 바라보고 있던 창유리에 비친 방안 난로불빛을 제외하고는 내가 볼 수 있는 것은 아무것도 없었다. 하지만 내 자신이 지금 누군가의 시선으로부터 정밀조사를 받고 있다는 생각이 들어 내 모든 관절이 아파왔다.\\n\\u3000방안에는 세 명의 숙녀들과 한 명의 신사가 있었다. 하지만 난 내가 창가에 서 있은 지 채 5분도 지나지 않아 그들이 하나같이 모두 아첨 꾼들이거나 협잡꾼(사기꾼)들이란 인상을 강하게 받았다. 물론 그들은 서로 상대방이 아첨꾼이고 협잡꾼(사기꾼)인 것을 모르는 체하고 있었다. 자신들이 그 사실(상대방이 아첨꾼이다)을 인정하면 자기들도 또한 또 한 명의 아첨꾼이고 협잡꾼(사기꾼)이란 사실이 들통 나기 때문일 것이다.\\n\\u3000그들 모두는 마음이 내키지 않는 태도로, 지루한 태도를 취하며 누군가의 허락을 기다리고 있었다. 그리고 숙녀 세 명 중에서도 가장 수 다스러워 보이는 숙녀는 하품이 나오려는 것을 억지로 참기 위해 아주 경직된 채 대화를 하고  있었다.\\n\\u3000방금 말한 그 숙녀의 이름은 ‘카밀라’(←독자가 100% 몰라도 되는 이름임, ‘카밀라’란 수다쟁이여자란 뜻임)이다. 그녀의 얼굴은 우리 누나(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)와 많이 닮았다. 하지만 카밀라가 우리 누나보단 더 나이가 많았고 카밀라의 얼굴이  어딘가  더  둔해보였다. 물론 나는 이 모두를 그녀를 처음보자마자 알아챘다.\\n사실대로 말해 내가 그녀의 얼굴을 좀 더 잘 파악했을 땐 그녀의 얼굴이 그나마 사람의 얼굴을 하고 있는 것이 어느 모로 보다 그녀 자신에겐 고마운 일이라고  생각하게  되었다.  그녀의  얼굴은  창문이  없는 벽 같았다. 무표정했고 얼굴이 위 아래로 너무 길었다.\\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000 (아래에 나오는 등장인물이름들 모두 전혀 몰라도 됨, 모두 엑스트라 들임)\\n\\n\\u3000“아, 불쌍한 영혼!” 내가 말한 여성(카밀라, 수다쟁이)이 퉁명스럽게 말했다. 퉁명스럽게 말하는 모습까지 우리 누나를 꼭 빼닮아 놀랐다. 카밀라가 퉁명스럽게 말했다. “그 자신이, 자기 자신의 적이라니깐요!” “누군가 다른 사람의  적이  되는  것이  더 훌륭했을  텐데  말이죠.” 신\\n사가 말했다. “훨씬 더 자연스러운 일이기도 했을 테고요.”\\n\\u3000“레이몬드 오빠(사촌오빠),” 또 다른 여성이 의견을 말했다. “우리이 웃을  사랑해야 해요.”\\n\\u3000“세라 포킷아,” 레이몬드 사촌이란 그 신사가 되받아쳤다. “사람이  자기 자신의 이웃이 아니라면 누가 이웃이겠어?”\\n\\u3000포킷 양(아가씨)이 웃었다. 그리고 카밀라도 하품을 가까스로 참으며 웃으면서 말했다. “원, 그런 말도 안 되는 소리를.”\\n\\u3000그러나 내가 보기엔, 그들은 그 신사가 한 말(그자에겐 이웃도 없을 것이다)이 시기적절하다고 여기는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000아직 단 한 마디도 하지 않고 있던 다른 여성이 엄숙하면서도 단호하게 말했다. “사실이지 뭘 그래요!”\\n\\u3000그들은 대화를 나누는 동안에도 계속 나(주인공)를 자세히 살펴보고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“아, 불쌍한 사람!” 카밀라가 곧 자신의 말을 이어갔다. “그 사람은 아주 이상한 작자예요! 누가 믿을까만, 글쎄 톰(←독자가 전혀 알 필요가 없는 이름임, 디킨스가 그냥 쓴 이름임)의 아내가 죽었을 때 말이에요, 아이들이 엄마의 죽음을 애도하는 데 있어서 색깔이 짙은 장식들을 아이들의 옷에 다는 것이 중요하다는 사실을 납득시키려고 무진장 애를 썼지만 실패했지 뭐예요. 그러더니 제게 이렇게 말하는 거예요. ‘카밀라, 하느님 맙소사! 엄마를 잃은 저것들이 검은 옷만 입으면 되었지 그게(색깔이 짙은 장식들을 다는 것) 무슨 의미가 있단 말이오?’라 고요. 정말 매튜답지 않아요! 나 원 참 그런 말도 안 되는 소릴 하다니!”\\n\\u3000“그(이름이 ‘매튜’, 소설 중반부터 등장하게 될 인물임)에게도 좋은 점들이 많이 있지 않을까요? 암 좋은 점들이 많이 있고말고요.” 레이몬드 사촌이 혼자서 북 치고 장구 치며 말했다. “그 사람에게도 좋은 점들이 있다는 사실을 제가 부정한다면 하늘이 절 용서치 않을 겁니다. 하지만 그는 예의범절에 관한 센스(감각) 자체가 없어요, 그리고 앞으로도 절대 없을 거구요.”\\n\\u3000“그러니까 제가 그렇게 말했던 거예요,” 카밀라(수다쟁이여자)가 말했다. “제가 분명히 말했죠. 제가 그 사람에게 이렇게 말했어요. ‘그러시면 안 됩니다. 절대로. 톰의 가족들 명예를 먼저 생각하셔야죠.’ 저는 이 얘기도 이런 했었어요. ‘색깔이 짙은 장식들을 아이들 옷에 달지 않으면 톰의 가족들은 사람들로부터 엄청난 망신을 당하게 될 거예요.’라고요. 그걸 관철시키기 위해 전 아침식사시간 때부터 저녁식사시간 때까지 마구 울어댔죠. 제가 얼마나 그 일에 열을 냈는지 제가 그만 소화불량에 걸렸을 정도였으니까요. 결국 그 사람이 무섭게 화를 내며 제게 욕지거리를 하더니 이렇게 말하더군요, ‘어디 네 마음대로 해봐 라.”라고요. 하나님께서도 감사하시지, 비가 억수같이 쏟아지는 날이었 지만 전 그 즉시 외출을 해서는 장례식 날 쓸 물건들(장례식 날 옷에   다는 장식들)을 다 사가지고 돌아왔지요. 이 일은 언제나 제게 위로가 된답니다.”\\n\\u3000“돈은 그 분(매튜)이 내셨잖아요, 그렇지 않나요?” 에스텔라가 쏘아 붙였다.\\n\\u3000“누가 돈을 냈는지는 지금 이 상황에서 중요한 게 아니란다, 얘야.” 카밀라(수다쟁이여자)가 되받아쳤다. “그걸 내가 나가 사왔다는 것이 중요하지. 그리고 나는 밤에 잠에서 깨면 평화로운 마음으로 그때 일에 대해 종종 생각해볼 거고.”\\n\\u3000멀리서부터 울러 퍼진 “종소리가” 내가 지나온 통로(복도)를 향해 누군가를 부르는 것 같은 “메아리” 혹은 고함치는 것 같은 “메아리와 결합했다.”\\n\\u3000방안에서 벌어지던 대화가 중단되었다. 메아리 소리를 듣더니 에스텔라가 내게 말했다. “자 네 차례야 꼬마야!”\\n\\u3000창문 밖을 바라보던 내가 방안 쪽으로 몸을 돌리자 그 자리에 있던 모두가 최대한의 경멸을 담은 시선으로 나를 바라보았다. 그리고 내가 방에서 나가자마자 ‘세라 포킷’(미스 해비샴의 친척,  독자가  알 필요 없는 이름임)이 제일 먼저 다음과 같이 말하는 소리가 들려왔다. “어떻게! 이런 어처구니없을 데가 있죠!” 그러자 카밀라(수다쟁이여자)가 더 분개하며 이렇게 덧붙였다. “세상에 이런 경우가 어디 있담! 이건 말도 안 돼요!”라고.\\n\\u3000우리는 촛불에 의지한 채 어두운 통로를 따라 걸어가고 있었다. 그때 갑자기 에스텔라가 멈춰 섰다. 그녀가 방향을 돌리더니 그녀의 얼굴을 내 얼굴에 아주 가까이 들이댔다. 물론 악담을 내게 퍼부으면서.\\n“응?”\\n\\u3000“응이라니요, 아가씨?” 하마터면 그녀에게 걸려 넘어질 뻔하다가 가 까스로 멈춰서며 내가  대답했다.\\n   그녀가 나를 자세히 살펴보며 서 있었다. 당연히 나도 그녀의 얼굴    을 뚜려지게 쳐다보며 서 있었다.\\n“내가 예쁘니?”\\n“예, 아주 예쁘신 것 같아요.” “내가 무례하니?”\\n“지난번만큼은 무례하지 않으신 것 같아요.” 내가 말했다.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n“흥 지난번만큼은 무례하지 않다고?” “예.”\\n\\u3000그녀는 마지막 질문을 할 때 발끈했었다. 그녀가 있는 힘껏 내 뺨을 “찰싹” 때렸다. 그건 내가 막 그녀의 질문에 대답을 하려던 순간이었다.\\n\\u3000“지금은?” 그녀가 말했다. “이 작고 천한 괴물아, 지금은 나에 대해 어떻게 생각하지?”\\n“말하지 않겠어요.”\\n“뭐? 위층에 올라가서 다 말하려는 거지? 그렇지?” “아니에요.”  내가  말했다.  “그게  아니에요.” “지금은 왜 울지 않지, 이 어린 철면피야?”\\n\\u3000“아가씨 때문에는 다시 울진 않을 거니까요.” 내가 말했다. 그건 거 짓말이었다. 그 말을 한 그때부터 지금까지 그 말은 여전히 거짓선언인 채 내 안에 남아있다. 왜냐하면 난 그때도 이미 그녀 때문에 마음 속 깊이 울고 있었고, 그 이후로도 난 그녀 때문에 늘 고통 받아 왔다는 사실을 잘 알기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000이 사건(그녀가 주인공의 뺨을 때린 사건)이 있은 직후 우리는 다시 계단을 올라가고 있었다. 우리가 계단을 거의 다 올라갔을 때 손으로 더듬으며 내려오고 있는 한 신사 분(남자주연, 소설 중반부터 나옴)과 우리는  마주치게 되었다.\\n\\u3000“저 아이가 누구냐?” 그 신사 분이 걸음을 멈추면서 그리고 나를 내 려다보며 말했다.\\n“그냥 꼬마에요.” 에스텔라가  말했다.\\n\\u3000그는 체격이 건장한 남성이었다. 그리고 피부색이 몹시도 어두운(짙은) 남성이었다. 머리 크기가 몸에 비해 지나치게 큰 남성이었고, 머리 크기에 호응하기 위함인지 그 남성의 손은 지나치게 커보였다.\\n\\u3000그가 자신의 그 커다란 손으로 내 아래턱을 들어 올리더니 촛불에 내 얼굴을 돌려가며 찬찬히 살펴보았다.\\n\\u3000이제 보니 그는 나이에 비해 그의 머리 윗부분이 너무 빨리 대머리가 된 경우였다. 그의 검은 눈썹은 너무 텁수룩해서 누워있지 않고 곤두서 있겠다고 우기는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그의 두 눈은 얼굴에 아주 깊숙이 박혀 있었고, 그의 두 눈은 불쾌할 정도로 날카로워 보였고 사람에 대한 의심이 대단히 많아보였다. 그는 큰, 회중시계(주머니에 넣고 다닐 수 있게 만든 작은 시계)의 쇠줄을 지니고 있었다(쇠줄이 컸다).\\n\\u3000그의 얼굴에는 아주 짙은 검은색 반점들이 많았는데, 만약 그가 면도를 하지 않고 내버려두었다면 그곳(검은 색 반점들)에 턱수염과 구레나룻가 낳을 위치였다.\\n\\u3000그는 내게 아무런 중요성도 없는 사람이었다.  그리고  그때는  나도 그가 어떤 식으로 내게 중요성을 뛰며 다가올지를 전혀 예측할 위치에 있지도 않았다. 다만 내가 그를 자세히 살펴볼 수 있는 호기(좋은 기회)가 때마침 내게 주어진 것이다.\\n\\u3000“이봐, 이 동네 아이냐?” 그(변호사, 남자주연, 변호사 시작을 아동 범죄담당변호사로 시작했고 지금은 런던에서 가장 잘 나가는 유능한 변호사임, 미스 해비샴의 고문변호사)가  물었다.\\n“예, 어르신.” 내(남자주인공, 아직은 꼬마)가 대답했다. “어떻게  여길 왔지?”\\n“미스 해비샴 마님께서 부르셔서요, 어르신.” 내가 설명했다.\\n\\u3000“이런! 얌전하게 굴어라! 소년에 대해서라면 나도 꽤 많은 경험이 있으니까. 너희 소년들은 끼리끼리 모여 나쁜 짓들을 하는 세트야. 자 명심해두어라!” 그가 엄청나게 기다란 자신의 집게손가락 옆을 자기 이빨로 물면서 그리고 나를 노려보며 말을  했다.  “여기선  얌전히 굴어 라!”\\n\\u3000그 말을 마치자 그가 나를 놓아주었는데 어찌나 기쁘던지. 그의 손에서 향기로운 비누냄새가 났기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000어쨌든 그는 계단을 내려갔다. 나는 궁금해졌는데 ‘그가 혹시 의사인 가?’ 싶었기 때문이다. 하지만 곧 의사는  아니라는 결론을 내렸다. 그냥 그런 생각이 들었다. 그리고 저런 사람이 의사일 수도 없다. 의사였다면 좀 더 조용히 좀 더 설득력 있게 내게 말을 했을 것이기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 주제로 너무 많은 생각을 할 수 없었는데, 그 신사를 떠나   보낸 후 내가 곧 미스 해비샴의 방 앞에 도착했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그녀(미스 해비샴)와 그 밖의 모든 물건들이 정확히 내가 그 방을 떠나올 때와 똑같이 놓여 있었다. 문 가까이에 나를 세워둔 채 에스텔라가 가 버렸다. 나는 미스 해미샴 마님이 화장대에서 내게로 고개를 돌릴 때까지 문 가까이에 가만히 서 있어야했다.\\n\\u3000“그랬군!” 그녀(미스 해비샴, 중년여성)가 별로 놀라거나 당황하지 않으며 말했다. “날짜가 지난거야,  그렇겠지?”\\n“예, 마님. 그러니까  오늘이….”\\n\\u3000“됐다, 거기까지, 거기까지만 해라!” 그녀가 손가락들을 성마르게(성 급하게) 흔들어 대며 말렸다. “날짜는 알고 싶지 않다. 그래 놀 준비는 되었겠지?”\\n\\u3000약간의 혼란을 경험하며 나는 내가 대답을 강요당하고 있다는 사실을 알게 되었다. 내가 말했다. “마님, 제 생각에 제가 아직….”\\n\\u3000“카드놀이를 다시  하는  건  어떻겠니? 그건  할  수 있겠지.” 그녀가  내 의견을 살피는 듯한 눈초리로 요구했다.\\n“예, 마님. 그건 제가  할  수  있어요.  마님께서  원하신다면….” “그러니까 이 집이 네게 낡고 무덤 같은 인상을 준다 이거겠지, 그\\n렇지?” 미스 해비샴이 참지 못하고 말했다. “그래서 기꺼이 놀지는 못 하겠다 이거고. 어떠니 일은 할 수 있겠니?”\\n\\u3000내가 ‘다른 질문’(놀거니?)에 대한 답을 찾기 위해 애를 쓴 것보다  훨씬 더 빨리 훨씬 더 잘 ‘이 질문’(일할래?)에 대한 대답을 할 수 있었음을 뻔할 뻔자다. 나는 내가 기꺼이 일할 준비가 되어 있노라고 말 씀드렸다.\\n\\u3000“좋아. 맞은 편 방에 들어가 있어라.” 그녀가 내 뒤쪽에 있는 방문을 그녀의 바짝 마른 손으로 가리키며 말했다. “내가 갈 때까지 저 방에서 기다리고 있어라.”\\n\\u3000나는 (실내에 있는) 계단(의) 방문을 넘어 그녀(미스 해비샴, 37세)가 가리킨 방안으로 들어갔다. 내가 들어간  그 방 역시 햇빛이 단 한  줄도 들어오지 않게 완전히 차단되어 있었다. 그 바람에 통풍이 잘 되지 않아 후텁지근한 곰팡이 냄새가 강하게 나고 있었다.\\n\\u3000습기 차 보이는 구식 벽난로가 방안에 하나 있었는데 얼마 전에 불을 지핀(붙인) 것 같았다. 불이 타고는 있었는데 활활 타오르지는 못하고 곧 꺼지고 싶어 하는 눈치였다.\\n\\u3000그리고 그 벽난로로부터 마지못해 피어오른 연기가 방안 가득 꽉 버티고 서 있었는데 바깥 맑은 공기보다 훨씬 더 추워 보였다. 꼭 우리 늪지대의  안개 같았다.\\n\\u3000“벽난로 위에 있는 높은 선반 위”에 “황량한 나뭇가지 같은 촛불들”이 몇 개가 있어 방안을 희미하게 비추고 있었다. 아니 좀 더 자세히 얘기하자면 그 촛불들이 방안을 비추는 것이 아니라 방안의 어둠을 약간 더 어수선하게 만들고  있었다.\\n\\u3000방은 널찍했다. 용기내 말하자면 그 방은 한 때 굉장히 아름답고 굉장히 멋진 방이었음이 분명해 보였다. 하지만 눈으로 알아볼 수 있는 모든 물건들에는 먼지와 곰팡이가 한 가득 뒤덮어 있었고 그 먼지와 곰팡이가 이제 뚝뚝 조각조각 떨어지고 있었다.\\n\\u3000당장 눈에 띄는 물건이 하나 있었다. 넓게 펴진 식탁보(천)로 뒤덮인 긴 식탁이었다. 그 식탁은, 이 집과 시계들이 모두 함께 멈춰버린 날, 어떤 대규모 축하연(신랑 신부가 결혼식 날 식탁 위에 있는 큰 케이크 자르기 행사)이 베풀어질 준비를 하고 있었던 것만 같았다.  “식탁   중앙의 장식 접시” 또는 “식탁 중앙에 놓는 어떤 종류의 장식물” 같은 물체가 식탁보 중앙에 놓여 있었다. 그 물체 위로 거미줄들이 아주 심하게 매어 있어서 그 물체의 형체를 도무지 구별할 수가 없었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그 중앙의 물체 바깥으로 넓게 펼쳐져 있는 노란색의 무언가를 따라 바라보고 있었는데, 내가 지금 기억하기로는, 그것은 마치 검은 버섯처럼 보였고 아직도 자라고 있는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000나는 얼룩투성이인 몸통에 작은 반점을 있는 다리들을 가진 “거미 들”이 “중앙에 있는 그 물체”를 자기 집으로 해서 들어가고 다시 그것에서 나오고 하는 것을 보았다. 그건 마치 “거미 지역공동체”에 지금 막 가장 중요한 공적인 사무가 발생한 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000나(주인공, 아직은 꼬마, 10살)는 쥐가 칸막이벽 뒤에서 덜거덕거리는 소리도 들었다. 마치 거미사회공동체를 혼란스럽게 만든 그 중대 사무(주인공의 등장)가 쥐들의 이해관계에도 동일하게 중요함을 덜거 덕거리는 소리로 표명하고 있는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000그러나 검은 색 딱정벌레들만은 이런 동요에 전혀 미동치 않았는데, 나이 많고 무거워 움직이기 어려운 몸을 이끌며 난로 바닥 주위를 이 리저리 손으로 더듬고 있었기 때문이다. 그 모습이 마치 딱정벌레들은 근시이고 귀가 안 들려 거미나 쥐들의 동태에는 전혀 개의치 않겠다는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000불행히도 내 마음은 이들 기어 다니는 것들을 지켜보는 것에 완전히 매료된 상태였다. 그때 미스 해비샴이 내 어깨 위에 손을 올려놓았다.  나는 그녀가 오는 줄도 모르고 벌레들에 온통 정신이 팔린 채 쳐다보고  있었던 것이다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴은 다른 쪽 손에 지팡이를 쥐고서 몸을 지탱하고 있었다. “윗부분에 나무그릇이 다린 지팡이”이었다. 그녀의 모습이 이 곳 (폐허가 되어 각종 벌레들이 기어다니고 있는 먼지투성이 거미줄투성이 방)에 사는 마녀같이 보였다.\\n\\u3000“이것은,” 그녀가 지팡이로 기다란 식탁을 가리키며 말했다. “이것은 내가 죽어 누울 자리다. 그럼 그들이 오겠지. 여기 누운 나를 보려고 말이다.”\\n\\u3000그녀가 당장 식탁 위로 올라가 그 즉시 죽어버릴 지도 모른다는 어떤 막연한 불안감과 그렇게 되면 내가 예전에 박람회장에서 본 송장 같은 밀랍 인형이 지금 당장 현실이 될 수도 있다는 막연한 불안감에   나는 그녀의 손아래에서 움츠러들고 말았다. (소설 앞부분에서 주인공이 박람회장에서 실물과 똑같이 만든 밀랍 인형을 보고 충격을 받은 적이 있음. 밀랍 인형은 당시  유명한 어떤  영국정치인을 본떠  만든  밀 랍 인형이었음. 각 지역을 돌며 추모행사하며 사람들에게 보여준 것. 유명인사가 죽으면 그렇게 하는 게 당시 유행이었다고 함)\\n\\u3000“저게 뭐라고 생각하느냐?” 그녀(미스 해비샴, 37세)가 지팡이로 다시 지목하며 물었다. “저거 말이다, 거미집들이 쳐져 있는 저거 말이다?”\\n“뭔지  모르겠어요, 마님.”\\n“큰 케이크다. 웨딩케이크였지. 내 웨딩케이크!”\\n\\u3000그녀가 분노로 이글거리는 눈으로 방안 여기저기를 둘러보았다. 내 어깨를 짚고 있던 그녀의 손에서 경련이 느껴졌다. 그녀가 말했다. “가자, 어서, 저리로! 나를 걷게 해 다오, 나를 걷게 해다오!”\\n\\u3000나는 그녀의 말을 듣고 내가 해야 할 일이 미스 해미샵 마님이 방안을 빙글빙글 돌 수 있게 도와드리는 것이란 걸 알았다.\\n\\u3000그러므로 나는 즉시 걷기 시작했고 그리고 그녀는 내 어깨 위에 손을 올려놓은 채 기대며 걸었다. 내가 이 집 지붕 아래에서 처음 들어왔을 때 생각한 것이 “펌블추크 씨(능청맞은 잡곡상)의  ‘2륜 경마차’ (바퀴 두 개인 마차)”였다. 우리는 지금 그의 2륜 경마차와 같은 걸음걸이 속도를 내며 걷기  시작했다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 육체적으로 튼튼하지 못했다. 잠시 걷던 그녀가 이렇게 말했다. “좀 더 천천히!” 우리는 여전히 성급하고 변덕스러운 속도를 유지 하고 있었고, 우리가 그런 뒤죽박죽 페이스로 걷는 동안 내 어깨 위에 있던 그녀의 손이 경련이 일으켰고, 그녀의 입은  한쪽으로  비뚤어져 계속 움직이고 있었다. 그래서 나는 생각했다. ‘우리가 지금 빠르게 걷고 있다’라고 그녀가 생각하는 이유는 그녀가 생각을 빨리 하고 있기 때문이라고.\\n\\u3000잠시 후 그녀가 말했다. “에스텔라를 불러다오!” 그래서 내가 층계참 (계단과 계단 사이에 있는 좀 넓은 공간)으로 나가 지난번에 내가 그랬던 것처럼 그 이름을 함부로 고함쳐 불렀다. 에스텔라가 든 촛불이 나타났다. 나는 미스 해비샴에게로 되돌아갔다. 그리고 우리(미스 해비 샴과 주인공)는 다시 방안을 빙글빙글 돌기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000만약 에스텔라 혼자서만 방으로 와서 우리의 행동들을 보았어도 나는 충분히 불유쾌했을 것이다. 하지만 어쩌나(ㅜ_ㅜ) 그녀 혼자만 온 것도 아니라 아까 내가 아래층에서 만났던 세 명의 여성과 한 명의 남성을 동행하고서 에스텔라가 나타난 것이다. 난 이제 뭘 해야 될지 아무 생각이 나지 않았다.\\n\\u3000예의상이라도 멈춰야 할 것 같아서 멈추려는데 미스 해비샴(37세, 여자주연)이 내 어깨를 홱 잡아당겼다. 그래서 우리는 계속 걸었다. ‘모두들 내가 꾸민 짓이라고 생각하겠지’ 싶어 엄청 창피해하며 나는 걷고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“친애하는 미스 해비샴 마님은,” 세라 포킷(여자이름, 미스 해비샴의 친척)이 말했다. “안색이 어쩜 저리 좋으실까!”\\n\\u3000“안색이라니,” 미스 해비샴이 되받아쳤다. “비쩍 마른 뼈와 누른 거 죽만  남은 사람에게.”\\n\\u3000세라 포킷 양이 퇴짜를 맞자 카밀라(수다쟁이여자)의 표정이 밝아졌다. 카밀라가 미스 해비샴을 애처롭다는 듯 바라보더니 이렇게 투덜거 렸다. “저 가엾은 영혼 좀 봐! 확실히 이젠 밝은 구석이라곤 어디에도 없네.  가엾어라! 원!”\\n\\u3000“그래 넌 어떻게 지내느냐?” 미스 해비샴이 카밀라에게 물었다. 그때 우리(미스 해비샴과 주인공꼬마)는 카밀라에게 다가가고 있었기 때 문에 내가 당연히 멈추려고 하는데 이번에도 미스 해비샴은 멈추려고 하지 않았다. 우리는 카밀라를 스치고 지나갔다. 이 모든 행동을 내가 먼저 꾸민 것이라 생각할 테니 카밀라가 엄청 불쾌해하지나 않을까 하 는  걱정이 들었다.\\n“고마워요, 미스 해비샴 마님.” 그녀(카밀라)가 대답했다. “마님께서 예상하시는 대로죠.”\\n\\u3000“왜, 무슨 문제라도 있는 게냐?” 미스 해비샴이 도가 지나칠 만큼 날카롭게 물었다.\\n\\u3000“공식적으로 언급할 가치라곤 없지만 서도,” 카밀라가 계속 말했다.  “제 감정들을 표현하고 싶진 않지만서도, 마님, 저는 밤이면 늘 제가 감당할 수 있는 것보다  훨씬  더 마님만을  생각하고 있어요.  제가 감당 할 수 있는 것보다 훨씬 더요, 마님.”\\n\\u3000“그러면 내 생각을 안 하면 될 거 아니냐.”라며 미스 해비샴이 쏘아 붙였다.\\n\\u3000“아주 쉽게 말씀하시네요, 마님!” 카밀라(수다쟁이여자)가 윗입술을 내민 채 흐느껴 울려다 상냥하게 억누르며 발언했다. 엥? 그녀가 눈물을 흘리기 시작하며 말했다. “레이몬더(카밀라의 남편, 사기꾼)가 증인이에요, 마님. 제가 밤마다 얼마나 많은 ‘생강과 탄산암모니아’(생기를 북돋아주는 것들임)를 복용하는 것을 강요당하고 있는지요. 레이몬더가 증인이에요, 마님. 밤마다 제 두 다리가 얼마나 많은 신경성 경련을 경 험하는지요. 하지만 ‘숨이 가빠오는 것’과 ‘신경성 다리경련’은 저에게 새로운 것이 아니랍니다. 이 두 가지 증상은 제가 사랑하는 사람들에  대한 걱정을 할 때면 널 저와 함께하는 것들이니까요. 만약 제가 덜 애정이 깊고 덜 예민했더라면, 제 소화는 지금보다 훨씬 더 잘 되었을 것이고 전 무쇠(강철)덩어리 같은 신경을 가졌을 텐데요. 확실히 그렇    게 할 수만 있으면 참  좋으련만. 하지만  밤에 마님을  생각하지 않는다 는 것은…, 원, 설마!, 그건 말도 안 되고말고요!” 이 마지막 부분을 강 조하면서 그녀(카밀라, 수다쟁이여자)는 폭풍 같은 눈물을 터뜨렸다.\\n\\u3000그녀(카밀라)가 말한 레이몬드(사기꾼)라는 사람이 지금 이  방에  있는 저 신사라는 것을 나는 이해할 수 있었다. 그리고 그가 카밀라의 남편이라는 사실도 막 이해했다.\\n\\u3000그(레이몬드)가 이 지점에서 아내(카밀라, 수다쟁이여자)를 구조하기 위해 가까이 다가왔다. 그러더니 “그녀를 위문”하며 그리고 “아내의 마님에 대한 애정에 무한한 경의를 표하며” 그가 이렇게 말했다. “카 밀라, 이 상냥한 여인아, 가족(친척인 미스 해비샴)에 대한 당신의 애정이 당신의 체력을 서서히 체력을 약화시켜서 급기야 당신 한 쪽 다   리가 다른 쪽 다리 보다 더 짧아지게 되었다는 것은 잘 알려진 사실이야.”\\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000(아래에 나오는 세 명의 여성이름 모두 독자가 알 필요 없는 인물들   임. 엑스트라임. 소설 전체 줄거리와 전혀 상관없음. 연관성 0%. 그냥 “먼 친척들이 돈 많은 미스 해비샴을 어떻게든 우려먹으려는 속셈이었다.”는 것이 주된 내용임.)\\n\\n\\u3000“나는 처음 듣는 얘기인걸요.” 내가 목소리를 딱 한 번밖에 들어본 적이 없는 그 엄숙한 표정의 여성(독자가 알 필요 없는 등장인물임)이 논평을 내놓았다. “누군가에 대해 생각한다고 해서 그 사람에게 뭔가 큰 대가를 바래도 되는 건가요? 친애하는 카밀라 씨.”\\n\\u3000그러자 기다렸다는 듯이 ‘세라 포킷 양’(결혼 안 한 할머니)이 이 발 언을 지지하며 말했다. 그 전에 잠깐 이 여성(세라 포킷 양)의 외모를 묘사하자면, ‘세라 포킷 양(할머니)’은 깡마르고 작은 체구에 갈색피부 그리고 얼굴에 주름이 엄청 많이 잡힌 노파(할머니)였다. 그녀의 자그 마한 얼굴은 마치 호두껍데기로 만들어진 것 같이 주름이 많았다. 고양이 입같이 큰 입을 가진 여성이었는데 실제 고양이와의 차이가 있다면 그녀에겐 고양이 수염이 없었다. 그녀(세라 포킷, 미스 해비샴의 친척)가 자기 자리에 단단히 버티고  선 채  이렇게 말했다.  “안 그런가  요?  카밀라  씨. 에헴!”\\n\\u3000“생각하는 거야 충분히 쉬운 일이니까요.” 엄숙한 표정의 여성이 동의하며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“생각하는 것보다 더 쉬운 일은 없죠?” 세라 포킷 양(할머니)도 동의했다.\\n\\u3000“오, 그래요, 그래!” 카밀라(수다쟁이여자)가  울면서  고함을 꽥질렀 다. 그녀는 이제 동요하는 감정들이 그녀의 다리에서부터 그녀의 가슴으로까지 솟아오르고 있는 것 같았다. “제가 드린 말씀은 다 사실이란 말이에요! 애정이 너무 넘치는  것이  제  약점인  걸요, 저도 그걸  어쩔  수 없단 말이에요. 그렇지 않았다면 당연히 제 건강은 지금보다 훨씬   더 좋았을 테고요. 그래도 가능한 한  전 제게 주어진 이 기질을 바꾸지 않을 거랍니다. 비록 제게 수많은 괴로움을 주었지만, 어쨌건 제가  밤에 깰 때면 제가 그런 기질을 지니고 있는 것에 감사하는 것이 제게 위안거리니까요.” 이 마지막 말을 하면서 그녀는 무엇이 그렇게도 북받쳐 오르는지 또 한 번 눈물을 왈칵 터뜨렸다.\\n\\u3000지금껏 내내 “미스 해비샴(37세)과 나(꼬마, 10세)”는 단 한 차례도 멈추지 않은 채 계속해서 방안을 빙글빙글 돌고 있었다. 어떨 때는 방 문객들의 스커트를 휙 스쳐 지나갔고, 또 어떨 때는 이 음침한 방 저쪽 끝에서 그들을 바라보기도 하면서 말이다.\\n\\u3000“매튜(소설 중반에 나오는 남자조연)를 보세요!” 카밀라(수다쟁이여 자)가 말했다. “그가 어디 친척들이랑 어울리려고 하나요? 그가 언제  미스 해비샴 마님께 와서 안부를 여쭌 적이 있었나요? 사실 제 자랑 같지만, 전 제 코르셋(허리를 조여 주는 속옷) 끈이 끊겨 의식불명인채 소파에 누워 장장 세 시간을 누워 있었어요. 그래도 오직 마님께  안부를 여쭈기 위해 이런 불편한 몸을 이끌고 온 거란 말이에요. 제가 소파에 쓰러져 있을 때 제 머리는 소파 바깥에 있었고 머리카락들은  온통 산발이 되어 아래로 쳐져 있고,  가만 있자 그때 내 다리는 어디에 있었담?”\\n\\u3000“당신 다리는 머리보다 훨씬 높은 곳에 있었소, 내 사랑.” 카밀라 씨 (남편)가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그래요. 그런 상태로 몇 시간을 의식불명인 채 누워 있다 왔다고요. 그건 모두 이상하고 이해 불가능한 매튜의 정신 나간 행동들 때문이었 다고요. 그런데도 사람들은 아무도 제게 고맙다고 말을 하지 않는 거 예요.”\\n\\u3000“당연히 안 그래야지! 당연한 거 아니니.” 엄숙한 표정의 여성이 이의를  제기하며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“알아들었니? 얘야.” 온화한 척 하지만 겉과 속이 다른 인물인 ‘세라 포킷  양’(결혼 안한  할머니)이 덧붙였다. “네 자신에게  던져야할 질문은 누가 네게 감사하다는 말을 하길 네가 기대했느냐가 되어야해, 알겠니? 얘야.”\\n\\u3000“고맙다는 말은 기대도 하지 않았단 말이에요, 그런 비슷한 것도 기 대하지 않았어요.” 카밀라(수다쟁이여자)가 얘기를 다시 시작했다. “저는 몇 시간이고 그런 의식불명인 상태로 소파에 누워 있었어요. 여기 있는 레이몬드(카밀라의 남편)가 증인이란 말이에요. 제가 어느 정도까지 숨이 막힌 상태였는지 그리고 얼마나 많은 생강(생강은 기운을 북 돋아주는 음식)을 먹고도 정신을 못 차리고 있었는지? 제가 신음하는 소리가 우리 집 건너편에 있는 피아노  조율사의  집에까지  들렸데요. 다만 불쌍한 아이들이 제 신음소리들을 멀리서 비둘기들이 구구구 우는 새소리로 오해했음이 분명하지만요. 그런데 지금 제가 여기서 듣고 있는 소리라고는….” 이 말을 하던 카밀라가 손을 목으로 가져갔다. 그 러더니 이 방에서 그냥 이 참에 새로운 짜 맞추기의 결판을 보겠다는      양 격렬한 화학반응(격하게 울기)을 시작하는 것이다.\\n\\u3000매튜라는 이름이 나오자  미스 해비샴이 나를 멈춰 세웠다. 그녀 자신도 멈춰 섰다. 미스 해비샴이 카밀라를 빤히 쳐다보며 서 있었다. 미   스 해비샴의 이러한 변화는 카밀라가 화학반응(격하게 울기)을 갑자기 멈추게 하는 데 큰 영향을 미쳤다.\\n\\u3000“매튜도 결국 여기 와서 나를 보게 될 것이다.” 미스 해비샴이 준엄한 목소리로 말했다. “내가 저 식탁 위(케이크가 있는 식탁 위)에 눕게 되면 말이다. 저기 바로 저 자리에 그가 서 있을 것이다.” 미스 해미샴이 쥐고 있던 지팡이로 식탁 위를 후려치면서 계속 말했다. “내 머리   맡에 서 있겠지. 그럼 네(카밀라, 수다쟁이여자) 자리는 저기고, 네 남편 자리는 저길 테고! 그래 세라 포킷(결혼 안한 할머니, 겉과 속이 다른 여인) 당신 자리는 이쪽일 테지! 그리고 조지아나(앞에서 말한 엄숙한 표정의 여자, 독자가 알 필요 없는 이름임, 이후 소설에 등장하는 이름이 아님) 네 자리는 이쪽일 테고! 나를 먹어치우러 올 때 각자 식탁 어디에 서 있어야 하는지 이제 잘 알았겠지. 그럼 이제 가봐!”\\n\\u3000그들의 이름을 하나씩 언급할 때마다 미스 해비샴은 지팡이로 식탁 위 새로운 장소를 후려쳤다. 그녀가 이제 이렇게 말하고 있었다. “나를 걷게 해다오, 나를 걷게 해 어서!” 그리고 우리는 다시 방안을 걷기 시 작했다.\\n\\u3000“그런 건가요.” 카밀라가 소리쳤다. “순응하고 떠나는 수밖엔 없냐고요. 그럼에도 불구하고 이렇게 짧은 시간 동안이나마 제 사랑과 대상이자 의무의 대상인 마님을 뵙게 된 것이 제겐 얼마나 뜻 깊은지 모른 답니다. 제가 밤에 깨 이번 일에 대해 생각해볼 때면 울적하다가도 만족스러울 거예요. 매튜 그 사람도 이런 위안을 얻을 수 있으면 좋으련만, 그는 원체 이런 걸 멸시하는 사람이니까. 여길 올 때 전 제 감정들을 다 표시하지 않기로 마음먹었어요. 하지만 저희를 마치 거인인 양 말씀하시고 그리고 저희들을 보고 친척의 재산을 먹어치우려는 사람인 양 대하시며 가버리라고만 하시니 정말 너무하세요. 그건 말도 안 된 다고요!”\\n\\u3000카밀라 부인이 들썩거리는 자신의 가슴에 손을 얹자  카밀라  씨(남 편)가 부인을 달래기 위해 다가왔다. 그러자 카밀라 부인은 부자연스러울 만큼이나 꿋꿋한 채했었는데 내 생각에는 아마도 그녀가 이 방을 나가자마자 확 쓰러져 죽어버리고 말겠다는 심산인 것 같았다. 적어도 그런 확연한 의지를 미스 해비샴에게 어필하려는 듯 보였다. 뭐 어쨌든 카밀라 부인이 자기 손에 키스를 해 미스 해비샴에게 인사를 보냈다. 그런 후 카밀라 부인은 남편의 부축을 받아가며 방에서 나갔다.\\n\\u3000세라 포킷(결혼 안 한 할머니, 겉과 속이 다른 여인)과 조지아나(엄숙한 표정의 여인)는 누가 맨 마지막으로  이 방에서 나갈 것인지를 두고 논쟁하고 있었다. 하지만 세라 포킷은 너무나 빈틈이 없는 여자였다. 세라 포킷이 조지아나에게 뒤지지 않으려고 약삭빠르게도 조지아 나를 빙 돌아 느긋하게 걸어나가는 바람에 결국 마지막 남은 조지아나가 먼저 방을 나가는 상황이 연출되었다.\\n\\u3000그때서야 세라 포킷(할머니)이 “몸조심하세요, 미스 해비샴 마님!”이라며 별도의 작별 인사를 했다. 세라 포킷은 나머지 사람들(카밀라 부부와 조지아나)의 나약함에 대해 자기 딴에는  아주  불쌍히 여긴다는 듯한 미소 한 방을 그 호두껍데기 같은 얼굴표정으로 한 가득 마구 날  리며  방을 나갔다.\\n\\u3000그들이 계단을 내려갈 수 있도록 에스텔라가 촛불을 들고 비춰주기 위해 방을 나간 사이에도, 미스 해비샴은 내 어깨 위에 손을 얹은 채 계속해서 걷고 있었다. 하지만 그녀의 걸음은 점점 느려져만 갔다.\\n\\u3000결국 벽난로 앞에 이르자 그녀가 멈춰 섰다. 그녀가 말했다. 아니 벽 난로를 몇 초간 바라보는 듯 하더니 이렇게 중얼거렸다.\\n“오늘이 내 생일이란다, 핍.” (핍은 주인공이름, 10세)\\n\\u3000내가 막 생일 축하 인사를 건네려는데, 그녀가 지팡이를 들어올리며 제지했다(막았다).\\n\\u3000“난 누가 내게 그런 말(생일축하인사)을 하는 것을 용납지 않는단다. 방금 여기에 있던 그자들이나 다른 어느 누구도 내게 그런 말을 하지 못한다. 매년 이날이면 저들이 여길  오지만 감히  내게  그런  말을 건네 지 못하지. 내가 용납지  않으니까.”\\n물론 나는 그 말(생일축하인사)을 더 꺼내려고 하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000“매년 이 날이면, 그래 네(주인공꼬마)가 태어나기도 훨씬 전에, 이 부패더미(결혼식 케이크)가….” 그녀가 “나무그릇이 달린 지팡이”로 “식탁위에 있는 거미집들 무더기”를 가리키며 말했다. 하지만 지팡이로 그걸 건드리지는 않았다. “저 부패더미(케이크)가 여기로 배달되어 왔지, 네(주인공꼬마)가 태어나기도 훨씬 전에 말이다. 쥐들이 저걸(케이크) 괴롭혀왔어, 쥐들의 이빨보다 더 날카로운 이발들이 내 신경을 갉아먹어왔듯이.”\\n\\u3000그녀(미스 해비샴, 37세)가 “지팡이의 머리 부분”을 자기 심장에 갖다 댔다. 그녀는 그런 자세로 식탁을 쳐다보며 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000“그녀가 한때 입었을 하얀 드레스, 이젠 완전히 누렇게 변해 쭈글쭈 글해진 그 드레스,” “한때는 식탁 위를 덮고 있었을 하얀 식탁보, 이젠 완전히 누렇게 변한 나머지 쭈글쭈글해진 저 식탁보,” 주위에 있는 이 모든 것들이 손으로 한 번 건드리기만 하면 순식간에 가루로 변하고말  상태에 있었다.\\n\\u3000“모든 게 폐허로 변해버릴 때면.” 그녀가 시체 같은 표정을 지으며 말했다. “저들이 내 시체를 저기(식탁)  위에 눕힐 것이다. 신부복을 입힌 채 말이다. 반드시 그렇게 될 거고, 그러면 그 자(결혼식 피로연 때 나타나지 않은 신랑, 미스 해비샴의 재산을 노렸고 실제 상당한 재산을 들고 튄 지능형 사기꾼, 옥스퍼드 대학교 졸업생)에 대한 저주도 마 무리 될 것이야. 그 저주가 내 생일날 완성된다면 훨씬 더 좋겠지.”\\n\\u3000마치 식탁 위에 누워 있을 자신의 시신이 보인다는 듯이 그녀가 지금 그곳(식탁 위)을 바라보고 서 있었다. 나는 조용히 있었다. 에스텔라가 돌아왔다. 그리고 에스텔라 역시 침묵을 지키고 있었다. 우리는 그렇게 오랫동안 침묵을 지킨 채 서 있었던 것 같다.\\n\\u3000방안의 공기는 무거웠다. 그 방은 구석구석 무거운 어둠을 품고 있었다. 내가 심지어 ‘에스텔라와 나조차도 곧 썩기 시작할 것이다’라는 놀라운 상상을 했을 정도다.\\n\\u3000한참 있다가 그녀(미스 해비샴, 37세)가 정신을 차렸다. 그건 산란했던 그녀의 마음이 서서히 회복된 것이 아니었다. 한참의 시간이 지난 뒤 번쩍 정신을 차린 것이다. 그녀가 말했다. “너희 둘이 카드놀이를 하는 모습을 내게 보여 다오. 왜 시작하지 않았지?”\\n\\u3000그 말과 함께 우리 셋은 방으로 다시 돌아왔다. 에스텔라와 내가 방 바닥에 앉아 카드놀이를 시작했다. 내가졌다. 저번처럼 내가 먼저 거지가 되었기 때문이다. 다시 카드놀이를 시작했다. 아까처럼 또 다시 내 가졌다.\\n\\u3000그러는 동안에도 미스 해비샴은 우리를 지켜보고 있었다. 그러면서 그녀는 내가 에스텔라의 아름다움에 주목하게 만들었다. 그리고 그녀가 가지고 있던 각종 보석들로 에스텔라의 가슴과 머릿결을 장식함으로써 내가 점점 더 에스텔라의 아름다움에 빠져들게 했다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라, 그녀에 대해 말하자면 그녀의 태도는 지난번과  같았다. 다만 차이점이 있다면 그녀가 이번에는 아예 자신을 낮춰 나와 얘기를 나누는 것 자체도 스스로에게 허락하지 않았다는 점이다. 우리가 게임을 여섯 번 정도 끝내자 미스 해비샴이 내가 다시 방문할 날짜를 정해 주었다.\\n\\u3000그런 후 에스텔라가 나를 안뜰로 데리고 내려갔다. 그리곤 그녀가 지난번처럼, 개가 먹이를 제공받는 방식대로 나에게 빵과 맥주를 주었 다(주인공의 얼굴을 쳐다보지도 않은 채 바위 위에 두고 가버렸다는 얘기). 그나마 다행인 것은 내 좋을 대로 안뜰을 이리저리 돌아다닐 수 있게 그녀가 날 내버려두고 가버렸다는 점이다.\\n\\u3000내가 지난번에 “벽을 기어 올라가 너머다 봤던 정원”의 문이 그때도 이렇게 열려 있었는지 닫혀있었는지 따지려는 의도는 없다. 다만 그땐 문을 본 기억이 없는 것 같았는데 지금은 내 앞에 문이 하나 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000문은 열린 채로 있었고, 그리고 나는 에스텔라가 방문객들(미스 해비 샴의 생일을 축하하러 왔던 ‘여성 세 명과 남성 한명’)을 모두 바래다주고 돌아왔다는 사실 그것도 대문까지 잠근 후 그 열쇠를 들고서 돌아온 모습을 이미 방에서 보았었기 때문에 지금 여기엔 아무도 없겠거니 하고 무심코 정원으로 들어가 곳곳을 거닐어 보았다.\\n\\u3000정말 황무지가 따로 없었다. 낡아빠진 멜론받침대들과 더 낡은 오이 받침대들이 정원 곳곳에 널 부려져(흩어져) 있었다. 그건 마치 어정쩡한 모습으로 저절로 자라났던 멜론과 오이들이 헌 모자와 구두 조각마냥 기울어져 있는 것 같았다. 오래 써서 낡은 스튜(찌게) 냄비의 겉모습처럼 잡초가 우거져 분지(땅)를 이룬 모습이 곳곳에 보였다.\\n\\u3000정원과 온실을 샅샅이 다 뒤져보았지만 아무 것도 없었다. 그냥 여 기저기 넘어져 있는 포도나무와 몇몇 술병들뿐이었다. 주위를 둘러보고 내가 창문 너머로 들여다보았던 그 음침한 구석(정원의 구석)에 와 있는  것을 발견했다.\\n\\u3000집이 텅텅 비어있다는 것을 당장은 확신했었기 때문에 나는 또 다른 창문 하나를 들여다보며 내 얼굴이 어떻게 비치나 보려다가 그만 깜짝 놀라고 말았다.\\n\\u3000저쪽 편에 붉은 눈꺼풀에 담색(옅은 빛깔) 머리카락을 가진 도련님이 이쪽을 들여다보고 있었기 때문이다. 유달리 창백한 얼굴을 가진 도련님이었다. 우리는 그렇게 서로를 빤히 쳐다보며 눈빛을 교환했다. 그 눈빛에는 다양한 의미(이제부터 결투)가 담겨 있었다. \\n\\u3000이 창백한 얼굴의 도련님이 갑자기 사라지더니 내 옆에 다시 나타났다. 창문을 사이에 두고 내가 그를 빤히 쳐다보고 있을 때 녀석은 공부 중이었다. 이제 보니 새까만 잉크도 여지저기 옷에 묻어 있었다.\\n“안녕!” 녀석이 말했다. “젊은 친구(애송이란 뜻도 있음)!”\\n\\u3000이런 경우 최고의 맞대응은 나도 안녕이라고  따라하는  것이었기에 나도 “안녕!”이란 말을 녀석에게 건넸다. 하지만 젊은 친구란 막말은 생략했다. 내가 생각해도 품위 있는 행동이었다.\\n“누가 널 들여보내주었지?” 녀석이 말했다. “에스텔라 양이.”\\n“누가 여길 배회하도록 허락했지?” “에스텔라 양이.”\\n“좋아. 결투다.”라며 그 창백한 도련님이 말했다.\\n\\u3000도대체 그 녀석을 따라가는 것 말고 내가 그때 무엇을 할 수 있었겠는가? 그 이후로도 내 자신에게 종종 질문을 던져보았지만 도출되는 대답은 하나였다. “도대체 내가 그 녀석을 따라가는 것 말고 내가 다른 무엇을 할 수  있었겠는가?”\\n\\u3000녀석이 내게 최후통첩을 던졌을 때, 나는 너무 놀란 나머지 녀석이 가자는 대로 따라갔을 정도였다. 그땐 내 자신이  무슨  주문에  묶여  있는  것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000“잠깐 기다려봐, 그래도….” 몇 발작 가지 않아 녀석이 빙글 돌면서 말했다. “내 쪽에서 결투를 신청한 이상 네가 왜 싸워야하는지 이유를 설명해져야 하니까. 자 내 대답은 이거다!” 아니 이 녀석이(*_*). 이 세상에서 가장 사람 화나게 하는 방식으로 녀석이 자기 두 손을 찰싹 찰싹 쳐대더니 우아하게 한쪽 발을 뒤로 확 올려 찬 다음 정말이지 기가 막히게도 내 머리카락을 “확”  잡아당겼다.  그런  다음 녀석이  또 다시 자기 두 손을 찰싹찰싹 손뼉 친 다음 고개를 아래로 숙인 후 그 자세 그대로 자기 머리로 내 복부(배)를 들이받았다.\\n\\u3000마지막 이 황소 같이 무식한 행태(들이박기)는 빵과 고기를 막 먹고 난 직후인 나에게 대단히 무례한 짓이었다. 아니 이것저것 따질 것도 없다. 세상에 머리로 상대방의 배를 들이박다니 이런 제멋대로인 행동이 어디에 있단 말인가? 녀석의 어처구니없는 행동 때문에 나는 대단히 불쾌해졌다. 결국 내가 녀석을 맹공격했다. 내가 다시 녀석을 맹공격 하려는데 녀석이 황급히 이렇게 말했다. “좋아, 한 번 해보자 이거지?” 그러더니 내 제한된 경험(나이) 안에서는 도저히 납득할 수도 없는 전대미문의 방식으로 전진했다가 후퇴했다가를 반복하며 깡충깡충 춤을 춰대기 시작하는 것이다(킥복싱을  생각바람~룰루랄라~).\\n\\u3000“이것이 게임의 규칙이야!” 녀석이 말했다. 방금 그 말을 하면서, 녀석이 왼쪽 다리로 가볍게 뛰어오르더니 오른 쪽 다리로 바꾸었다. “정확히, 규칙대로 하는 거야!” 이 부분에서, 녀석이 또 오른 쪽 발로 뛰어오르더니 왼쪽 발로 자세를 바꾸었다. “좋아, 라운드로 와, 준비운동부터 철저히 하라고!” 이 마지막 말을 하면서 녀석이 재빨리 뒤로 비켜서더니 다시 앞으로  전진해왔다.  나는  하도  어의가  없어서  의지할 데  없이  녀석을  바라보고  있었고,  그러는  동안에도  녀석은 깡충깡충 이리저리 뛰어다녔다. 그것도 시도 때도 없이 앞으로 전진 했다가 다리를 바꾼 후 다시 뒤로 후퇴했다가를 계속하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000재주가 넘치는 녀석이었다. 그 때문에 나는 속으로 두려웠다. 하지만 그건 그거고, 그렇다고 녀석이 담색 머리로 내 배를 들이받을 하등의 상관관계는 없는 것이다. 그리고 내가 그런 황소같이 무식한 타격을 받았을 때에는 적어도 내겐 녀석의 행동을 비난할 수 있는 도덕적이고 타당한 권리가 내게도 있는  것이다.\\n\\u3000그러므로 내가 아무 말 없이 녀석의 뒤를 따른 것이다. 우리의 결투 장소는 정원의 외딴구석이었다. 두 벽들이 서로 만나는 곳이기도 했다. 몇몇 하찮은 물건들에 가려진 밖에선 보이지 않는, 정원의 외딴구석이 었다.\\n\\u3000녀석이 내게 “이 장소를 우리들의 결투장소로 만족하느냐?”고 물어 왔을 때 내 대답은 “그래”였다. 그러더니 녀석이 잠시 자리를 비울 테니 잠깐 동안만 기다려줄 수 있느냐고 정중하게 요구했고 내가 허락하자 사라졌다. 곧 녀석이 ‘물 한 병’과 ‘식초를 흠뻑 적신 스펀지 하나’ 를  들고 나타났다.\\n\\u3000“우리 둘 다 이것을 사용할 수 있어.” 녀석이 물병과 스펀지를 벽 가까이  놓아두며 말했다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 녀석은 자기 재킷과 조끼뿐만 아니라 셔츠까지 몽땅 벗기 시작했다. 녀석의 옷 벗는 방식에는, 뭐랄까 “나는 지금 이것을 편한 마음으로 즐기기 위해 한다.”는 감정과 “자기  역할에  충실하다”랄까 혹은 “나는 지금 피에 굶주려 있다”라는 의미를 한꺼번에 다 지니고 있었다.\\n\\u3000웃통을 벗은 녀석의 몸은 그리 건강해보이지는 않았다. 하지만 이렇게 무서울 정도로 준비를 철저하게 하는 것을 보고 난 아주 얼이 빠져 있었고 더구나 녀석의 얼굴에는 여드름들이 가득했고 입에는 종기까지 하나 있었다.\\n\\u3000아무리 내가 녀석을 내 나이 또래로 보았다지만 녀석의 키는 분명 내 키 보다 훨씬 더 커보였다. 거기다가 녀석은 사방팔방으로 움직이며 몸을 회전할 수 있는 방법도 알고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그것만이 아니었다. 웃통을 벗기 전 녀석은 회색 정장을 착용한 도 련님(‘미스 해비샴의 먼 친척인 매튜’의 아들임)이었다. 특히 녀석의 팔꿈치와, 무릎, 그리고 손목과 뒤꿈치들은 다른 부위에 비해 놀랄 만큼  발달되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000나에게 기계적인 정밀타격을 가하기 위해 내 몸을 이리저리 자로 재 보고 있는 녀석의 모습을 본다는 것은 내 심장을 덜컹하기에 충분했다. 녀석은 정말로 나를 해부할 듯이 재보고 있었고, 그 모습은 마치 녀석이 “어느 뼈를 먼저 발라줄까?”라며 엄밀히 재보고 있는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000내 첫 번째 주먹에 벌러덩 나가떨어지는 녀석의 모습을 보았을 때  내가 얼마나 당황했었는지는 이 자리에서 말하지 않게다. 말해도 여러분들은 상상도 할 수 없을 것이다. 나 자신도 내 평생 그렇게 놀랐던 적은 없었다. 내가 정신을 차렸을 땐 이미 녀석이 땅바닥에 대자로(벌 러덩) 누워 있었다. 녀석이 누운 자세로 나를 올려다보았다. 녀석의 코에선 피가 흐르고 있었고 녀석의 얼굴은 거의 반쪽이 되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000하지만  녀석은 다시 일어섰다. 그것도 곧장. 녀석이 스펀지가 놓여있던 자리로 가 얼굴을 닦았다. 그런 후 다시 좀 전과 같이 민첩한 자세를 취하며 내게로  다가왔다.\\n\\u3000녀석이 또 다시 내 주먹 한 방에 나가 뒹굴어졌을 때 그리고 쓰러진 녀석이 시퍼렇게 멍든 두 눈으로 나를 올려다보았을 때, 이때가 바로 내가 이 세상에서 두 번째로 가장 놀란 장면이었다. 물론 가장 놀랐던 장면은 의기양양하던 녀석이 내 첫 주먹에 나가 떨어졌을 때였다. 앞서 말했듯이.\\n\\u3000녀석의 정신력은 높이 살만 했다. 그의 행동은 내게도 많은 자극이 되었다. 그럼에도 녀석의 체력은 좋지 못했다. 그래서 난 절대 처음처럼 강하게 때리진 않았다. 하지만 내가 주먹을 휘두를 때마다 녀석은 나가 떨어졌고 그럼 녀석은 벽 쪽으로 가 스펀지로 얼굴을 딱은 후 물병의 물을 마신 후 이런 틀이 녀석에겐 큰 위안이 된다는 양 내게로 달려들었다. 그것도 매번 더욱더 자신만만한 표정으로 말이다. 내가 이 렇게 생각했을 정도였다. ‘잘못하면 내(주인공)가 끝장날 수 있겠구나.’라고.\\n\\u3000얼굴에 난 녀석의 멍 자국이 점점 더 심해져 갔다. 왜냐하면 지금 이 자리에서 그때 일을 들먹이기는 미안하지만, 녀석의 기세가 워낙에 의기양양해 내가 나도 모르게 그만 녀석을 더 여러 번 쳤고 매번 때릴 때마다 주먹의 강도를 높여갔기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그럼에도 녀석은 내게로 달려들었다. 물론 스펀지로 얼굴을 닦고 물을 한 모금 마시는 자기만의 싸움 의식을 치른 후 말이다.\\n\\u3000결국 녀석이 벽에 머리를 부딪치며 쓰러지고 말았다. 자리에서 일어선 녀석이 혼란스러워하며 몸을 이리저리 돌리고 있었다. 적(주인공)이 어디에 있는지도 모르는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000결국 녀석이 무릎으로 기어서 스펀지가 놓여 있던 자리로 갔다. 녀석이 스펀지를 내던졌다. 그와 동시에 녀석이 헐떡이며 말했다. “이건 네가  이겼다는 증거야.”\\n\\u3000녀석은 너무도 용감했고  또 너무도  순결했다. 내가  비록 먼저  제안한 싸움은 아니었지만 나는 적어도 이번 승리에 대해서만큼은 우쭐거릴 수 없었다. 다만 땅 바닥에 떨어져 있는 옷을 주워 입는 동안 음울(우울)한 만족을 느꼈을 뿐이다. 나는 내 자신이 무슨 잔인한 한 마리 늑대새끼 같이 느껴졌다. 아니 그런 종류의 한 마리 야수 같이 느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000나는 이따금 흐르는 피를 닦으며 어둡고 무거운 마음이 들어 녀석에게 이렇게 말해야했다.  “도와주까?”\\n녀석이  말했다. “괜찮아.”\\n내가 말했다. “그럼  안녕.” 그러자 녀석이 말했다.  “너도.”\\n\\u3000내가 안뜰로 돌아왔을 때, 에스텔라가 열쇠를 쥔 채 기다리고 있었다. 하지만 그녀는 내가 지금까지 어디 갔다 왔는지 왜 그녀를 기다리고 있지 않았는지 묻지 않았다. 다만 그녀의 얼굴이 밝게 상기되어 있었을 뿐이다. 마치 그녀를 기쁘게 한 무슨 일이 방금 생긴 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000역시나 그녀가 똑바로 문 쪽으로 가지 않고 통로 안으로 뒤로 물러나며 나를 손짓해  불렀다.\\n“이리 와봐! 키스해도 좋아. 네가 좋다면 말이야.”\\n\\u3000그녀가 뺨을 내게로 돌렸다. 내가 그녀의 뺨에 키스했다. 나는 생각 한다. 그녀의 뺨에 키스하기 위해 내게 얼마나 엄청난 시련들을 몰려오고 있었는지를. 하지만 그땐 그 키스의 의미를 내가 다르게 받아들이고 있었고 그건 단지 “거칠고 보잘 것 없는 소년에게 어쩌다 한 번 주어진 동전 한 닢 정도일 뿐이라고 생각했다.” 사실 그 이상의 의미도 없었다.\\n\\u3000생일 방문객들 때문에 지체되고, 카드놀이를 하느라 지체되고, 마지 막엔 싸움까지 하느라 지체된 시간이 꽤 되었다. 나는 미스 해비샴의 저택에 너무 오래 머물러 있었다.\\n\\u3000그래서 내가 집에 다 왔을 때에는, 습지대 끝에 위치한 모래언덕 위의 등대에서 침을 뱉듯이 불빛을 내뿜고 있었고 그 불빛들이 깜깜한 밤하늘을 배경으로 반짝반짝 빛나고  있었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 조(주인공의 매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물)의 화로에서  한 줄기 빛이 나와 길 전체를 가로지르며 산산조각 부서지고 있었다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 12장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000해쓱한 어린 신사 문제로 내 마음은 점점 더 불편해져만 갔다. 싸움에 대해 생각할 때면 땅에 나자빠져 있던 녀석의 얼굴이 자꾸 떠올랐고 여러 단계를 거쳐 새빨갛게 부어오른 녀석의 얼굴이 내게 어떤 만행을 저지를 것만 같이 느껴졌다. 녀석의 피가 아직도 내 머리에 붙어있는 것만 같았고 이제 사법당국의 개입은 당연해보였다.\\n\\u3000내가 어떤 벌을 받게 될 지는 확실하지 않았다. 다만 이것만은 분명 했다. ‘지체 있는 가문의 집을 유린하고 다닌 죄(정원에 들어간 죄), 면학에 열중하고 있던 영국소년을  꾀여  무자비한  주먹  폭격을  가한 죄. 이 정도면 시골소년이 세상에서 가장 가혹하고 달갑지 않은 처벌을 받지 않고는 마을을 활보하는 것은 불가능해보였다.’\\n\\u3000그 일이 있고 며칠 동안은, 그리고 집에 유폐되어 있을 때조차도, 심지어 내가 심부름을 나가게 될 때조차도 나는 최대한의 주의력과 떨림 (공포)으로 부엌문 밖을 내다보았고 주 교도소 경찰관들이 나를 덮치기 위해 기다리고 있는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000내 바지는 해쓱한 어린 신사가 흘린 코피로 얼룩이 져 있었다. 깊은  밤에 내 죄의 증거를 씻어내기 위해 아무리 노력해도 지워지지 않았다. 내 손가락 관절들도 녀석의 이빨들에 부딪쳐 찢어진 상태였고, 이제 법정으로 잡아 끌려들어가 재판관들 앞에 서 추궁을 당하고 나를 옭아맬 이 증거들에 대해 내가 거짓말을 꾸며내야 할 것이다. 내 상상 력은 수천가지 가지를 치며 서로 얽히고 엉키는 단계를 지나 내 스스   로를 쥐어뜯는 단계로 진입하고  있었다.\\n\\u3000우리가 싸웠던 장소로 내가 다시 방문할 날짜가 돌아왔을 때 내 공 포감은 극에 달했고, 마치 저 부엌문 밖에 런던에서 급파된 법의 앞잡 이(경찰관이나 집행인)들이 매복해 있다가 날 습격하지 않을지 의심이 들었다. 혹은 미스 해비샴이 그녀의 저택에서 벌어진 이 무도한 짓들에 대해 내게 개인적인 복수를 하고 싶은 나머지 그녀가 무덤 같은 옷을 입은 채 자리에서 일어나 권총을 꺼내들고는 나를 쏘아 죽이지는 않을지  걱정이 들었다.\\n\\u3000돈만 준다면 무슨 짓이라도 해낼 또래아이들을 구해 맥주공장에 잠 복시켜놓았다가 내가 다가갔을 때 한꺼번에 덤벼들어 내가 더 이상 방황할 수 없을 때까지 구타하지는 않을지 걱정이 들어다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이 모든 얄팍한 보복행위들에 녀석의 그림자는 없었는데 내가 녀석의 맑은 영혼에 대해 얼마만큼 확신하고 있었는가를 반증하는 증거다. 내 고민거리는 모두 녀석의 현명하지  않은  친척들이  녀석의 얼굴 상태를 보고 격앙한 나머지 그리고 가문의 우수성이 심각하게도 전받은 이번 사건에 대해 격하게 동정한 나머지 나를 해치려고 꾸밀 짓들이 아닐지 하는  문제였다.\\n\\u3000하지만, 나는 미스 해비샴의 저택으로 가야만 했다. 그리고 갈 수 밖에 없었다.\\n\\u3000보시라! 지난번 결투의 흔적은 이 집 어디에서도 찾아볼 수 없었다. 결투에 대해 어떤 식으로도 언급된 적도 없었고 저택 어디에도 이제 그 해쓱한 어린 신사의 모습은 보이지 않았다.\\n\\u3000나는 그때 그 문이 아직도 열러 있는 것을 보았고, 정원을 다시 거 닐어보았으며, 심지어 정원에 외따로 떨어져 있는 집의 창문에서 안을 들여다보기까지 했다. 하지만 안에서부터 잠긴 덧문(셔터)만이 갑자기 내 시야를 가렸을 뿐 집 어디에서도 녀석의 흔적은 찾아볼 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000우리들의 결투가 벌어졌었던, 정원 한 쪽 구석자리까지 와서야 비로소 나는 그 어린 신사의 존재에 대한 얼마간의 증거를 발견할 수 있었다. 그 자리에 폭행당한 상처에서 흘러나왔을 법한 핏자국들이 있었기 때문이다. 나는 다른 사람들이 보지 않게 정원의 부업토(풀이나 나뭇잎 으로 된 흙)로 그것들(핏자국)을  덮었다.\\n\\u3000“미스 해비샴의 방”과 “긴 테이블이 배치되어 있는 다른 방” 사이에는 넓은 층계참(계단 오르다가 쉬는 공간)이 있었다. 그 층계참에 정원 용의 의자를 하나 발견했다.  뒤에서  밀 수  있도록 바퀴들이  달린 무게 가 가벼워 보이는 의자였다. 그 의자는 내가 지난번에 왔을 때도 그  자리에  놓여 있었었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 바로 그날부터 미스 해비샴을 그 의자에 태우고 그녀의 방을 돌아 층계참을 가로지른 후 다른 방까지 도는 것이 내 정례적인 업무가 되었다. 그때쯤이면 그녀가 내 어깨위에 손을 얹고서 걸어 다니는  것에 싫증을 낼  때였다.\\n여러 번 되풀이해 그리고 거듭거듭 우리는 이 여정에 올랐고 때때로 그 여정이 세 시간 가까이나 계속되기도 했다.\\n\\u3000나는 의도적으로 이와 같은 우리의 여정이(방 돌기) 수없이 반복되었다는 것으로 최소 8개월 혹은 10개월 남짓 되었을 기간을 요약하려 한다. 그리고  내가 그녀의 의자를 밀었던 그 첫날 이미 내가  격일 정오 때마다 그녀의 집을 방문해 그녀를 정원용 의자에 태우고 방을 돌 아다니기로 결정되었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000우리(주인공과 미스  해비샴)가 서로에 대해 좀  더 적응해가면서, 미  스 해비샴이 내게 좀 더 많은 대화를 걸어왔다. 그녀는 내가 이때까지 무슨 공부를 했는지 그리고 커서 무엇이 되려하는지? 같은 유의 질문들을 던졌다.\\n\\u3000나는 그녀에게 이렇게 말했을 것이다. “조(매형)의 수습공이 될 예정 이에요. 제가 알기론 그래요.”\\n\\u3000그리고 내가 아는 것이 아무것도 없다는 것도 상세하게 말씀드렸고, 물론 기회만 주어진다면 모든 것들에 대해 배우고 싶다는 말도 빼놓지 않았다.\\n\\u3000사실 이 얘기를 하는 것은 당시 그녀의 질문이 어린 내게 미래의 어느 날 그녀가 나를 위해 무언가 도움을 줄지도 모른다는 생각을 품게 했었기 때문이다. 하지만 그녀는 그러지 않았다. 반대로 내가 무식한  것이 그녀에겐 상당히 마음에 드는 모양이었다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 내게 약간의 돈도 주지 않았다. 나는 매일의 저녁식사 이외에는 어떤 것도 더 제공받지 않았다. 그리고 내 봉사에 대해 미래의  어느 시점에 어떤 종류의 지불이 있을 거라는 것에 대해서도 그녀는 일언반구  말이 없었다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라는 언제나 내 주의에 있었다. 나에게 문을 열어준 것도 그리고 나를 대문 밖으로 내보내는 것도 모두 그녀의 몫이었다. 하지만   “한 번 더 키스해도 좋아”라는 말은 이젠 다시 하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 이따금씩 내 존재를 냉랭하게 받아들였고 또 이따금씩은 나에게 착하게 굴었고 또 이따금씩은 나와 아주 친밀한 척 굴었으며, 또 이따금씩은 내 존재에 대해 그녀가 더 이상 참을 수 없다는 듯 나를 혐오스럽다고 말했다.\\n\\u3000우리만 있을 때 미스 해비샴은 종종 낮은 목소리로 내게 이렇게 묻곤 했다. “그녀가 점점 더 예뻐지고 있지 않니, 핍?” (핍은 주인공이름, 아직은 열 살  꼬마)\\n\\u3000그럼 난 “예”라고 대답했고, 미스 해비샴은  그  대답을  갈망했는데 내가 해주니 좋다는 듯 즐겼다. 또한 우리(주인공과 에스텔라)가 카드 놀이를 하고 있을 때면 미스 해비샴은 에스텔라의 기분이 어떤 상태에 있든지 간에 에스텔라의 감정들을 하나도 놓치지 않고 구경하려 했다.\\n\\u3000그리고 이따금씩, 그녀(에스텔라, 어린 숙녀)의 감정이 폭발하기 일 보직전이 되고 또 그 감정들이 서로 다른 감정들에 대해 모순되어 내가 무슨 말을 해야 할지 또는 내가 그녀에게 어떻게 처신해야할지 몰라 곤혹스러워하고 있을 때면, 미스 해비샴은 애정이 듬뿍 담긴 포옹을 에스텔라에게 하며 그녀(에스텔라)의 귀에다가 이렇게 들리는 소리를  속삭여주곤 했다.\\n\\u3000“저들의 심장들을 찢어버려라 내 자존심(에스텔라)이자 내 희망아, 저들의 마음을 깨부숴버려라, 저들에게 더 이상의 자비는 없다!”\\n\\u3000조(주인공 꼬마의 매형)가 대장간에서 일할 때면 띄엄띄엄 따라 부르던 콧노래 비슷한 노래가 하나있다. ‘클레 멘 타인’(노동자들 민요) 이라는 오래된 민요인데, 노래는 수호성인에게 경의를 표하는 방식으론 전혀 말이 안 되는 것이었지만 어쨌든 ‘클레 멘 타인’이란 곡이 대 장장이들 편에 아주 가까이 위치해 있는 것은 사실이었다. 지금은 그렇게 생각하고 있다. 달구어진 쇠를 해머로 두들길 때 팔뚝의 힘을 조 절하기 위해 흥얼거리는  노래이니까.\\n\\u3000이 노래는 사실 대장장이들이 성스러운 프랑스 주교였던 ‘클레멘 트’(1세기에 프랑스 북동부 도시 메츠에 제자 2명과 함께 파견된 성스러운 가톨릭주교, 메츠에서 아이들을 잡아먹던 용을 격퇴했다는 전설이 이런..-_-; 그래서 지금 용이 한 마디로 안  남아  있군.  성인들이 용을 다 잡아버려서)의 이름을 자주 입에 올려 그날 하루가 행운이 많이 깃든 날이 될 수 있도록 하기 위해 만든 구실이기도 했다.\\n\\u3000노래가사는 이랬다. “해머 질을 하자 모서리를 둥글게, 탕탕 오 우리의 성스러운 클레멘트 주교님! 때리는 소리 좋고 울리는 소리 더 좋네, 오 성스러운 클레멘트 나리! 두들기고 패고, 두들기고 패고, 오 성스러운 우리의 클레멘트 주교님! 쨍그랑거리는 소리 죽이네, 오 성스러운 클레멘트 나리! 불 더 땅기자 불 더 땅겨, 오 클레멘트 주교님! 건조기 (물)는 으르렁거리고 연기는 높이 피어오르네, 오 우리의 성스러운 클 레멘트 나리!”\\n\\u3000의자를 밀고 방을 돌아다니기 시작한 직후였다. 어느 날 미스  해비  샴이 손가락들을 성마르게 움직이며 갑자기 내게 말했다.\\n“저 봐(짜증), 저 봐, 저 봐! 자, 노래나 한 번 해봐라!”\\n나는  놀란  나머지  마룻바닥  위로  의자를  계속해서  밀며  이 짤막한 노래를 낮은 목소리로 불렀던 것이다. 이 노래가 그녀의 기호에 맞았던지 내가 노래를 마치고 나자 그녀도 약간 생각에 잠긴 채 낮은 목소리로 따라 불렀다. 그 노래를 부르며 그녀는 마치 가벼운 잠에 취한 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그 후 이 노래가 우리(‘주인공꼬마’와 ‘미스 해비샴’)는 우리가 방을 돌아다닐 때마다 부르는 습관이 되었다. 그리고 에스텔라도 종종 우리 들과 함께 그 노래를 부르곤 했다.\\n\\u3000그렇지만 우리 세 명이 다 함께 그 노래를 부를 때조차도, 우리들이 만들어내는 음의 전체흐름이 너무 가라앉아 있어서, 노래 소리가 이 음침하고 오래된 가옥 안에서 부는 가장 가벼운 바람의 숨결소리보다 더 작게 들렸던  것이다.\\n\\u3000도대체 이런 환경들 속에서 내가 어떤 어른으로 성장할 수 있었겠는가? 도대체 이런 환경들에 속에서 내 성격이 어떻게 영향을 받지 않을 수 있었겠는가? 내가 이 연기 자욱하고 누런 방들 속에서 다시 햇빛이 비치는 바깥으로 내보내졌을 때 내 눈은 잠시 장님이 되었고 그와 같은 방식으로 그녀들과 어울려 있는 당시 내 사고도 망연자실한 상태 그대로였다. 이게 어디 놀랄 일인가?\\n\\u3000만약 내가 이전에 엄청난 거짓말들로 사람들을  속이지만  않았어도 혹은 사람들을 속였다는 것을 조(매형)에게 고백만 하지 않았어도, 나는 해쓱한 어린 신사(주인공이 때린 아이)에 대해 조(주인공의 매형)에게  얘기했을 것이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 사정이 이러하므로 내가 그 해쓱한 어린 신사에 대해 조에게 얘기해보았자 조가 그 아이를 분별할 수 없을지 의문이었고, 아마 그 아이를 내가 이전에 꾸며냈던 ‘검정색 벨벳(융단)으로 뒤덮인 마차 안에 타고 있을 법한 아이’로 생각했을 것이다. 그러므로 나는 그 해쓱한 어린 신사에 대해 조에게 아무 말도 하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000게다가, 내가 그녀들과의 첫 만남에서 우연히 떠올랐었던 생각 ‘다른 사람들 입에 미스 해비샴과 에스텔라의 얘기가 오르지 않게 피해야겠 다.’라는 생각이 시간이 지나면서 점점 더 강해져만 갔다.\\n\\u3000그때 당시 나는 비디(여자이름) 이외에는 어느 누구에게도 완전한 신뢰를 보이지 않고 있었다. 그렇지만 가련한 비디(여자조연, 평범한 외모, 고아출신, 저녁학교 여선생님이자 가게 점원, 주인공 꼬마 나이 또래)에게만은 내가 미스 해비샴의 저택에서 경험한 모든 일들을 얘기 할 수 있었는데 왜인지는 모르겠지만 비디에게 그런 얘기를 하는 것이 자연스러웠다.\\n\\u3000그리고 왜인지는 모르겠지만 그때 당시 비디는 내가 그녀에게 말하     는 모든 이야기들에 대해 깊은 관심을 보였다.\\n\\u3000그때는 그녀가 내 얘기들에 깊은 관심을 보인 이유를 알지 못했지만 지금은 내가 어느 정도 그 이유를 안다고 생각한다.\\n\\u3000한편 우리 집 부엌에서도 회의들이 계속되었는데, 이 회의들은 내 분노한 영혼을 거의 참을 수 없을 지경으로까지 몰고 가는 회의들이었다.\\n\\u3000저 당나귀  같은 펌블추크(능청스런 잡곡상, 조의  삼촌)가 밤에도 우리 집에 종종 들러서는 내 미래전망들에 대해 우리 누나와 장기간의 토론을 벌이곤 했었던  것이다.\\n\\u3000나는 정말이지 지금도 고백할 수 있다. 만약  내가 그때  당시 그 자의 2륜 경마차 바퀴 굴대에서 고정 핀을 뽑을 수만 있었다면 내가 정말로 그리 하고도 남았을 거라는 사실을 말이다. 내가 그와 같은 몹쓸 생각을 한 것에 대해, 지금 이  순간까지도 내가 응당 받아야  될 양심의 가책보다 훨씬 적은 양심의 가책을 느낀다.\\n\\u3000그 끔찍한 인간은 앞이 꽉꽉 막히고 무신경한 지성의 산물이라 나를 자기 앞에 세워두지 않고는 내 장래에 대해 논할 수가 없다는 입장이었다. 이를 테면 나를 이용해 자신의 꽉 막힌 사고를 작동시켜보겠다는 심산이었다.\\n\\u3000그는 보통 내 옷깃을 잡고 부엌 구석에 조용히 있던 나를 내 의자 (등받이가 없는 의자)에서 끌어내 난로불 앞에 세워두곤 했다. 이제부터 나를 요리해보이겠다는 듯 이렇게 말을 하는 것이다.\\n\\u3000“자, 부인(주인공의 누나), 여기 이 꼬마가 있습니다! 이 꼬마 녀석은 부인께서 손수 기른 아이입니다. 고개를 들 거라 소년아, 그리고 너를 손수 길러준 이들(매형과 누나)에게 영원히 감사해해라. 자, 부인, 이 꼬마에 대해 한  말씀하셔야죠!”\\n\\u3000그런 다음이면 그는 자기 손바닥으로 내 머리카락들을 마구 구기곤 했다. 자신의 손바닥으로 남의 머리카락들을 마구 구기다니! 내가 앞에서도 암시하지 않았는가? 내 가장 초창기 기억에 따르더라도, 어느 누 구도 동료 인간에 대해 그와 같은 행동을 할 권리는 없다. 나는 영혼 으로부터 이를 확신하는  바이다.\\n\\u3000또한 내 소매를 잡고 자기 앞에 나를 붙들어 세우는 것은 오로지 그  자와 같은 정신○○자이 보일 수 있는 광경(모습) 그 자체인 것이다.\\n\\u3000그 다음에, 그(펌블추크 씨)와 내 누나(주인공과  20살차이)가  짝을 이뤄 아주 그냥 미스 해비샴에 대해 엉터리 같은 온갖 추측을 하는 것이다. “미스 해비샴이 이 애(주인공)에게 혹은 이 애의 앞날을 위해 무엇을  해줄 것인가?”라며.\\n\\u3000그들이 해대는 생각들이 어찌나 억측이 심한지 듣고 있는 나는 너무 가슴이 아팠고 그래서 심술이 나 눈물을 터뜨리며 펌블추크 씨에게 달려들어 주먹으로 그의 몸 구석구석을 마구 때려줄까 하고 바랐을 정도였다.\\n\\u3000이러한 대화들 속에서 누나는 나를 언급할 때마다 누나의 이빨들 중 하나를 뽑는 듯이 정신적으로 마음이 미어지는 듯이 나에게 말을 했다. 누나가 그러는 동안 펌블추크 씨는 내 후원자를 자처하며 얕보는 듯 한 표정으로 나를 전체적으로 흩어보며 앉아 있곤 했다. 그럴 때면 흡사 그의 모습은 내(주인공) 행운의 건축가인양 그리고 마치 자기 자 신은 이 일에 전혀 보상을 바라지 않는다는 듯 행동하는 것이다.\\n\\u3000이러한 토론들에  조(주인공의 매형)가 낄 틈은  없었다. 하지만 대화가 한참 진전되면 누나는 참지 못하고 조(누나의 남편)에게 큰 소리를 지르며 얘기하곤 했는데 다름이 아니라 내가 대장간을 떠나는 것에 대해 그(조)가 호의적인지 않다는 인상을 ‘조 부인’(주인공의 누나, 20살 차이)이 받곤 했기 때문이다. 나는  이제(그때)  조의 수습공이  될 정도  로  충분한 나이었다.\\n\\u3000조가 부지깽이를 손에 쥔 채 무릎을 꿇고 앉아 아래쪽 벽난로 사이에서 재를 끓어내며 곰곰이 생각에 잠겨 있을 때면, 내 누나는 조의  이런 순박한 행동을 아주 분명한 반대의견을 표시하는 것으로 생각해 남편(조)에게 달려들어 남편의 손에서 부지깽이를 빼앗아든 다음 자기 손으로 남편을 마구 흔들어댄 다음 분을 참지 못하고 부지깽이를 부엌 바닥에  내동댕이치는 것이다.\\n\\u3000이러한 토론들 중 어느 것 하나도 나를 극도로 자극하지 않고 끝난  적이 없었다. 이 일이 먼저다 저 일이 먼저다 할 것도 없었다. 어느 순간 갑자기, 누나는 하품을 하려다 멈추곤 했었고 그럼 누나의 눈에 내가 우연이라도 뛰는 경우엔 그 즉시 누나가 나를 위에서부터 덮쳐 내 려오며 이렇게 말하곤 했다.\\n\\u3000“자!  네 녀석 때문에 이젠 역겹다! 어서 썩 침대로 올라가지 못해.      네 녀석이 애먹이는 건 오늘 밤만으로도 충분해 알겠어.”\\n\\u3000이건 마치 내가 그들에게 “제발 내 삶에 애 좀 써주세요!”라며 간청이라도  했다는 식이었다.\\n\\u3000이런 상황(미스 해비샴이 주인공 꼬마에게 어떤 대가를 줄 것인지에 관한 토론)이 오랫동안 계속되었고 이 상황은 앞으로도 오랫동안 지속될  것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그런 어느 날이었다. 내 어깨에 기대, 나와 함께 걷던 미스 해비샴이 갑자기 걸음을 멈추고는 불쾌하다는 듯 말했다.\\n“점점 키가 자라고 있구나, 핍!” (핍은 주인공이름)\\n\\u3000키가 커지는 것은 내가 어떻게 통제할 수 있는 상황이 아니었기 때문에 난 명상에 잠긴 표정을 지어보이는 것으로 넌지시 그 말을 인증하는 것이 최선이라 생각해 그렇게 했다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 당장은 아무런 말이 없었다. 하지만 이내 곧 멈춰 서더니 나를 다시 살펴보기 시작했다. 그러더니 또 다시 멈춰 서고는 나를 다시 살펴보았다. 그 후 그녀가 눈살을 찌푸리며 언짢은 표정을 지었다.\\n\\u3000내가 방문하기로 한 다음 번째 날(이틀에 한 번씩 방문하고 있었음) 이었다. 평소와 같이 우리가 운동(방 안 걷기)을 마치고 내가 그녀를 화장대까지 바래다주었을 때 그녀가 그 성마른(성급한) 손가락들을 움 직여 보이며 나를 멈춰 세웠다.\\n“너희 집 대장장이 이름을 다시 한 번 말해 보거라.”\\n“조  가저리에요,  마님.”  (‘조  가저리’는  주인공의  매형이름) “그러니까 네가 도제살이(수습공)를 하기로 되어있다는 그 대장장이\\n말이지?”\\n“예, 미스 해비샴  마님.”\\n\\u3000“즉시 도제가 되는 것이 좋겠다. 그래 가저리가 너와 함께 여기로 와줄까? 네 도제계약서를 가지고 말이다. 내 말 알겠니?”\\n의심의 여지도 없이 매형(조 가저리)이 그 제안(미스 해비샴의 저택 방문)을 영광으로 여길 것임을 확신한다고 내가 말씀드렸다. “그럼 그에게 내가 좀 보잔 다고 전해라.”\\n“시간은 언제가 좋을까요, 미스 해비샴 마님?”\\n\\u3000“저 봐, 저 봐(짜증)! 나는 시간 따윈 모른다고 말하지 않았더냐. 그에게 내가 곧 보잔 다고만 전해라, 너와 같이 말이다.”\\n\\u3000밤에 내가 집에  돌아와서 조(매형)에게  미스  해비샴의 메시지(초대) 를 전했을 때, 누나(주인공의 누나)가 난동을 부리기 시작했다. 과거 누나가 부린 난동들보다 훨씬 더 걱정스러운 정도였는데, 누나는 나와 조에게 이렇게 묻기까지  했다.\\n\\u3000“당신들은 나를 구두 흙털개(실내출입구에 까는  매트)정도  생각하지? 어디 내 말이 틀렸어? 당신들이 어떻게 감히 나를 그딴 식으로 대접할 수 있지? 도대체 당신들은 내가 어떤 인간들과 어울려와 나와 적 합하다고 생각하는 거야 응?”\\n\\u3000이러한 질문들을 지칠 때까지 마구 연발하던 누나가 결국 촛대를 조 (남편)에게 던지곤 큰 소리로 흐느껴 울기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000그때 누나가 쓰레받기를 꺼내 들었다. 그건(쓰레받기 꺼내기) 내 경험상 대단히 좋지 않은 신호였다. 거친 앞치마까지 둘러맨 누나가 예의 그녀만의 무서운 청소를 시작했다.\\n\\u3000그것만이 아니었다. 물 없이 하는 청소에 만족하지 못한 누나는 물통 하나와 솔(바닥을 문질러 닦는 것) 하나를 챙겨들고는 우리들을 집 밖으로 쫓아낸 후 놀라운 기세로 물청소를 하기 시작했고, 그 바람에 우리(주인공과 매형)는 뒷마당에서 벌벌 떨며 기다려야했다.\\n\\u3000밤10시가 되어서야 우리는 다시 집안으로 기어들어가는 모험을 감행 했고 그러자 누나가 조에게 질문을 던졌다. “왜 흑인 여자 노예와 그때 당장 결혼하지 않았었던 거지?”라고.\\n\\u3000너무 기가 막힌 질문이라 그도 긴가? 민가? 말을 하지 못하고 손가락 끝으로 자신의  구레나룻(귀밑에서  턱밑까지의  수염)을 꼼지락거리며 낙심한 눈빛으로 나를 바라보고 있었다. 불쌍한 내(주인공) 친구.\\n그 행동은 마치 ‘내가 그때 흑인 여자 노예와 결혼하는 모험을 감행\\n\\n\\n했더라면 상황이 지금보다 훨씬 더 나아져 있지 않았을까?’라며 진지하게 생각해보고 있는 것만 같았다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 13장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000이틀 후 조(주인공 꼬마의 매형)가 나와 함께 미스 해비샴의 저택을 방문하기 위해 ‘교회 갈 때 입는 옷’을 입는 모습을 보는 것은 내 감정 에 대한 일종의 시련이었다. (소설 앞부분에서 조는 웃통을 벗어젖히고 대장장이 일을 할 때는 건장한 체구이지만 일요일에 교회를 가기 위해 양복만 입어면 세상에 이렇게 불쌍해 보이는 남자도 없었다고 말하고 있음)\\n\\u3000하지만 이 경우 자신이 꼭 예복(정장)을 차려입어야  한다고 그  자신이 생각하고 있었고, 또한 그가 그토록 예복에  신경을  쓰는  것이 모두 나 때문이기 때문에, 그리고 이 끔직할 정도로 불편해 보이는 옷을 굳이 입으려는 이유가 모두 나 때문이었기 때문에, 그리고 셔츠의 옷깃 을 뒤로 높이 올려 세우려는 이유와 머리 맨 윗부분의 머리카락들을 모조리 세워 한 다발의 깃털처럼 보이려고 애 쓰고 있는 것도 모두 나를 위해서란 것을 알았기 때문에 나는 “조는 작업복이 더 잘 어울려” 라고 차마 말을 할 수 없었다. 굳이 말을 했어도 소용없었을 것이다.\\n아침식사 시간에 누나가 다음과 같이 선포했다.\\n\\u3000“나도 당신네들과 같이 마을에 가겠어요. 당신네들이 귀부인들과 짝 짜꿍이 되던 뭘 어떻게 하던 나랑은 상관이 없으니까 일 끝나면 나를 데리려 펌블추크 삼촌 댁으로 오라고요.”\\n이게 누나가 자신의 의견을 개진하는 방식이다.\\n\\u3000그래도 “당신네들이 귀부인들과 짝짜꿍이 뭐 어쩌고저쩌고” 할 때 이미 조도 뭔가 상황이 극단으로 치달을 수 있다는 것을 눈치 챈 직후 였다.\\n\\u3000대장간은 그 날 하루 문을 닫기로 했다. 그래서 조가 문에 분필로 “오늘”이라고 딱 하나 썼다. (영어 ‘오늘’이 아니라 고대 독일어-사용하지 않는 단어로-로 ‘오늘’이라고 씀. 소설에서 조는 아주 가끔 영국의 지방사투리나 혹은 생뚱맞은 단어를 하나 씩 가끔 아주 가끔 사용하고 있음. 글을 모르기 때문임. 제가 사투리를 알아본 것이 아니라 영어사전에 영국지방사투리라고 나오기에  알았음)\\n\\u3000조는 또 “오늘”이란 글자 옆에 우리가 이제부터 갈 방향을 가리키는 “화살표”도 하나 길게 그려 넣었다. “오늘”과 “화살표 그리기”가 그가 대장간 일을 쉴 때면 꼭 문에 해두는 일종의 관례였던 것이다.\\n\\u3000우리는 마을까지 걸어갔다.  이때  누나는  비버의  모피로  만든  아주 큰 “모자”(차양이 없고 턱 끈이 있는 겨울용 여자모자)를 쓰고, 그리고 “짚으로 엮은”, 영국의 국새(도장) 같이 생긴 “광주리”를 들고 갔으며, 그리고 “나무 덧신 한 짝”과 “여분의 어깨걸이 솔하나”와, 그리고 “우산 하나….” 아니 우산이라니? 당연히 그 날은 비 한 방울 오지 않는   아주  화창한 날이었다.\\n\\u3000누나가 이러한 물품들을 그 생고생을 하며 들고 간 이유를 난 아직도 모르겠다. 나와 조(매형)을 손바닥으로 마구 때리며 대우한 것에 대한 참회의 순간을 위해? 아님 지극히 개인적인 목적에서 남들에게 내가 어느 정도까지 부귀한지를 알리기 위한 과시의 목적에서? 이 글을 쓰는 지금까지도 모르겠다.\\n\\u3000다만 “클레오파트라”나 “여타 미친 듯이 날뛴 여성군주들”이 자신들의 가장행렬이나 행진에서 부를 과시하기 위해 기를 쓰며 안달한 것처럼, 그때 당시 누나도 이 추운  겨울날 남들에게 잘보이기 위해 그 고생을 해가며 물건들을 가지고 간 것이 아닐까 한다. 그것도 겨울에….\\n\\u3000그래서인지 우리가 펌블추크  씨(능청스러운  잡곡상)의  집에 도착하 자 마자 누나는 집안으로 튀어 들어갔다. 우리(주인공과 매형)만 남았 는데 이젠 거의 정오가 다 되었던지라 조와 나는 곧장 미스 해비샴의 저택으로  향하기로 했다.\\n\\u3000언제나처럼 에스텔라가 문을 열어주었다. 에스텔라가 나타났을  때  조가 모자를 벗어 자신의 두 손으로 모자의 가장자리를 잡고서 모자의 무게를 재기 시작했다. 마치 지금 당장 5g(그램)의 측정오차로 자신의 모자무게를 재어야 될 긴급한 용무가 그의 마음속에 막 생긴 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라는 우리 둘 모두를 무시한 채 길을 안내했다. 나도 익히 아는 길이었다. 내가 에스텔라 뒤를 따라갔고 조가 우리 마지막에 따라 왔다. 긴 복도에 들어섰을 때 내가 조를 뒤돌아보았다. 조는 여전히 극도로 긴장한 채 양쪽 손으로 모자의 테두리를 잡은 채 무게를 재고 있 었다. 그리고 발끝으로 성큼성큼 걸으면서 우리 뒤를 뒤 쫒고 있었다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 말했다. 둘(주인공과 매형)이 함께 방안으로 들어가야 한다고. 내가 조의 코트 끝동(소매)을 쥐고서 미스 해비샴의 앞으로 그를 안내했다. 그녀는 화장대에 앉아 있었고 우리가 들어가자 즉시 뒤돌아 보았다.\\n“아!” 그녀가 조에게 말했다. “당신이 이 애 누나의 남편이오?”\\n\\u3000나는 상상도 한 적이 없었다. 내 친애하는 사랑인 ‘조’가 이렇게 그 자신의 실제모습과는 다른 사람으로 보일 줄은. 올려 세운 머리카락들이 새의 깃털 다발처럼 갈기가 나 있고 질문에 아무런 답변을 못한 채 서 있는 모습을. 마치 벌레 한 마리를 잡아먹고 싶다는 듯 입을 “아” 하고 벌린 채 주뼛주뼛 서 있는 어떤 특이한 형상을 한 새의 모습을 그가 우리 앞에서 보일 줄은 난 일찍이 상상도 하지 못했다.\\n\\u3000“당신이 이 애 누나의 남편이오?” 미스 해비샴이 다시 한 번  물었다.\\n\\u3000상황이 점점 악화되어 가고 있었다. 하지만 인터뷰 내내 조(주인공 꼬마의 매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물)는 미스 해비샴 대신에 나 에게만 말을 걸려고  고집했다.\\n\\u3000“그러니까 내 말은 말이다, 핍.”(핍은 주인공 꼬마이름) 조는 이제 설득력 있는 논증과 엄밀한 자기신뢰 그리고 과중한 정중함을 동시에  다 표현하며 이렇게 말했다. “그러니까 핍, 내가 네 누나와 결혼했을땐 말이다, 난 아직 네가 날 독신남이라고 부를 수 있을 때였지. 어쨌든 네가 그렇게 부를 의향이 있다면 말이다.”\\n\\u3000“이거야 원!” 미스 해비샴이  말했다. “당신이 저  애를 도제(수습공)로 삼으려고 기른 것이 아니요. 그렇지 않나요, 가저리 씨?”\\n\\u3000“왜 거 있잖아, 핍.” 조가 또 미스 해비샴 대신에 나를 보며 대답했다. “너와 난 언제나 친구였다는 걸 알지? 우리 우정은 앞으로도 계속될 거고. 왜 예전에 습지대에 있던 큰 바위에서 우리가 맺었던 약속을 말이다. 네가 도제가 되면 매주 이 바위에 와서 실컷 놀자고. 그럼에도 불구하고 말이다 핍, 네가 이 직업(수습공)에 반대의견을 내비치지만 않는다면 말이다 우린 앞으로도 영원히…, 그래 네가 검댕이나 숯 덩  어리 같은 것을 순순히만 받아들인다면 말이다 핍, 그럼에도 불구하고 말이다, 핍. 네가 그런 유의 의견을 제시했더라면 말이다, 핍. 응, 내말 무슨  뜻인지  알지, 핍?”\\n\\u3000“그럼 이 아이가  그동안 어떤 반대의견도 표명한 적이 없었단  말이오, 가저리 씨? 저 애가 그 직업(대장장이의 도제)을 좋아합디까?”\\n“핍, 그건 네 자신이 더 잘 알고 있는 문제야.” 조가 되받아쳤다. 그의 말투에는 이제 논증과 자기신뢰 그리고 정중함이 좀 전 보다 더욱더 확고해져가고 있었다. “그것이 네 자신의 심장이 바라던 바임이 틀림없다는 것을.”(7장 참조. 조가 아버지의 묘비에 새기려던 글. 어머니를 봉양해야 했음으로 결국 아버지의 묘비는 만들지 못함. 조가 생각했었던 묘지의 글은 다음과 같다. “1행  -  그의  결점이  무엇이든  이 글을 읽는 자여 기억하라, 2행 - 그가 자신의 심장 속에 어떤 선함을  지니고 있었음을.”)\\n\\u3000난 조가 말을 하기 전부터 벌써 알아봤다. 아버지 묘비 위에 새기려다 돈이 없어 포기했었던 자작시를 지금 이 상황에 대한 자신의 답변으로 새롭게 짜 맞추어 보면 어떨까? 하는 생각이 그의 머릿속에 불현 듯  떠올랐음을 말이다.\\n\\u3000조가 계속 말했다. “네 역할에 대한 반대는 없었을 지니, 그것이 네 심장이 지극이 바라던 바임이 틀림없나니라, 핍!” (조는 지금 영어단어 ‘심장’이란 단어를 사용하고 있는 것이 아니라 고대 독일어에서 의미가 파생되고 단어가 바뀐 고대영어를 사용하고 있음. 남들이 사용하지 않는 고대영어를 하나 둘 씩 사용하고 있음. 옥스퍼드영어사전 참조. 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 사람이란 것을 묘사하기 위해서가 아닐지…)\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴을 보고 얘기하라고 내가 그(조)를 설득하려했지만 내 노력은 모두 수포로 돌아가고 말았다. 내가 얼굴을 일그러트리고 몸짓을 하면 할수록 그는 더욱더 은밀하게 더욱더 논쟁적으로 더욱더 정중 하게 나만을 상대하려고  고집했다.\\n“이 애의 계약서들을 가져왔겠지요?” 미스 해비샴이 물었다.\\n\\u3000“이거 참, 핍, 있잖니.”(핍은 주인공이름) 조가 마치 그녀의 질문이  약간 부적절하다는 듯이 받아치며 말했다. “내가 그것들을 이 모자 속에다 넣어두는 걸 너도 봤잖니. 그러니 그게 여기에 있지 않겠니. 너도   잘 알지.”\\n\\u3000그(조, 주인공의 매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물)가 모자에서 계 약서들을 꺼내 미스 해비샴이 아니라 내게 주었다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴의 의자 뒤에 서서 우리를 지켜보고 있던 에스텔라의 두 눈에서 장난기 어린 웃음이 엿보였다. 난 유감스럽게도 내 친애하는 선량한 매형을 부끄럽다고 생각하고 있었다. 나는 정말 그렇게 생각하고 있었다. 그리고 에스텔라를 볼 낯도 없었다. 내가 그의 손에서 계약 서들을 꺼내 미스 해비샴에게  건네주었다.\\n\\u3000“이 애에게서 수수료 같은 건 기대하지 않았겠지요?” 미스 해비샴이 계약서들을 대충 훑어보며  말했다.\\n\\u3000조가 아무런 대답도 하지 않고 서 있자 내가 불만을 표시하며 말했다. “조! 왜 대답이  없어….”\\n\\u3000“핍.” 이런 내 태도에 마음을 다쳤다는 마냥 조가 나를 제지하며 말 했다. “내가 말하고 싶은 것은 말이다 핍, 그 질문은 너와 나 사이에는 대답할 필요가 없는 질문이었다는 것이란다. 너도 알잖니 핍, 그 질문에 대한 내 대답은 ‘확실히 아니다!’라는 것을 말이다. 알겠니? 핍. 그게 ‘기대하지 않았다’일 수밖에 없는 이유를. 그러니 내가 왜 그 질문에 대답을 해야  했었겠니?”\\n\\u3000거기에 서 있는 조의 모습을 보고서 미스 해비샴은, 내가 생각했던 것보다도 훨씬 잘 조가 어떤 사람인지를 이해했다는 듯 조를 힐끗 쳐 다보았다. 그녀가 옆에 있던 테이블에서 작은 봉투 하나를 꺼내들며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“핍(주인공 이름, 아직은 꼬마)은 여기서 수업료를 벌었습니다.” 그녀가 계속 말했다. “이게 증거입니다. 봉투 안에 천2백5십 만원이 들어있습니다. 핍, 이걸 네 주인에게 가져다주어라.”\\n\\u3000그녀의 낯선 이미지와 그녀보다 더 낯선 방 안 풍경들에 놀란 나머지 그만 얼(혼)이 완전히 나가있던 조는 심지어 이 같은 상황에서도 나한테만 말을 하려고  고집했다.\\n\\u3000“이것에 관한 한 아주 후하신 것 같구나, 핍.” 조가 계속 말했다. “과분한 은덕 잘 받겠다, 비록 조금도 아주 조금도 바란 건 아니었을 테지만 과분한 은덕 감사히 받겠다. 그런데 친구.” 조의 이 마지막 호칭에 난 얼굴이 화끈 달아올랐다가 냉각되고 말았다. 이 친밀한 호칭이 내가 아니라 미스 해비샴을 대상으로 하는 것 같이 느껴졌기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“그런데, 친구, 우리의 의무를 다해야할 것 같지 않니! 너와 내가 우 리의 의무를 성실히 이행하기를 빌게, 우리 모두 서로가 서로에게 말 이야. 그리고 너의 이 후한 선물이 사람들(주인공의 누나와 펌블추크 씨)에게 가져다 줄 만족감 그들이 이전에는 결코 가져본 적이 없었을 이 후한 선물이  사람들에게….”\\n\\u3000여기서 조는 자기 자신이 생각해도 끔찍한 곤경에 빠져버렸다는 것을 느끼는 듯 한 표정을 짓다, 다음과 같은 말을 하며 자기 자신을 의 기양양하게 구출해냈다. 조가 말했다. “나는 절대 그러지 않을 거야!” 자신이 생각해도 방금 한 말이 시의적절하고 설득력이 있었던 모양인지 똑같은 말을 두 번이나 반복했다.\\n\\u3000“잘 가거라! 핍.” 미스 해비샴이 말했다. “저들을 바래다 주거라, 에 스텔라.”\\n“제가  다시  찾아봬도  될까요,  미스  해비샴  마님?”  내가  여쭈었다. “안 된다. 이제부턴 가저리 씨가 네 주인이다. 거저리 씨! 잠깐 한\\n마디만 더!”\\n\\u3000나는 문 밖으로 나가면서 그녀가 뒤에서 조를 그와 같이 부르는 소리를 들었다. 그녀가 유달리 강조하며 조에게 이렇게 말했다. “저 애는 여기서 착한 소년이었어요, 그 돈은 그 애의 보수에요. 물론 당신도 정 직한 사람이니 다른 건 더 바라지 않을 거지만서도.”\\n\\u3000조(주인공 꼬마의 매형)가 어떻게 방에서 나왔는지 나는 지금까지도 전혀 모른다. 하지만 내가 아는 한 가지는, 방에서 나온 그가 계단을 내려오는 대신 자꾸만 계단을 올라가려고 했다는 것이다. 내가 아무리 말려도 그는 들으려고 하지 않았고 그 때문에 내가 그를 뒤쫓아 가 붙 잡아야했다.\\n\\u3000몇 분 후 우리는 대문 밖으로 나왔다. 그리고 대문은 잠겼고, 그리고 에스텔라는 가버렸다.\\n\\u3000우리 둘이서만 다시 태양빛을 흠뻑 받으며 서 있게 되자, 조가 벽에다 등을 기대며 내게 이렇게 말했다. “정말 놀랍구나!” 조는 그곳에 머무른 채 띄엄띄엄 시간간격을 두면서 “정말 놀랍구나!”라는 말을 되풀 이하고 있었다. 그 소리를 너무 자주 되풀이해서 혹시 그의 사리분별력이 다시 회복되지 못하는 것은 아닌지 내가 걱정했을 정도다.\\n   한참 있다가 조가 다음과 같이 말을 길게 할 수 있을 정도로까지 정신을 회복했다. “핍(주인공  꼬마이름), 내가 보증한다. 오늘 일은  정말  놀랍고 놀랍다!”\\n\\u3000그 후 조는 조금씩 대화를 주고받을 수  있게 되었고 우리는 그렇게     그 자리를 떠날 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형)의 지적능력들이 지금 막 접한 사건들로 총명해졌 다고 내가 생각할 합당한 이유가 있었다. 그리고 펌블추크 씨(능청스러운 잡곡상, 조의 실제 삼촌)의 집으로 가는 동안 조가 교묘하고도 꼼꼼   한 계획 하나를 착안해냈다고 내가 생각할 합당한 이유가 있었다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨 댁의 응접실에서 발생한 다음과 같은 일화 하나가 내가 그렇게 생각하게 된 이유였다. 그곳에 우리(조와 주인공)가 동시에 출 몰했을 때, 내 누나는 의자에 앉아 저 혐오스러운 씨앗 장수(펌블추크 씨)와  논의 중이었다.\\n\\u3000“뭐죠?” 우리 둘(조와  주인공)이  동시에  나타난  것을  보고  누나가 꽥 고함을 질렀다. “이게 어쩐 일들이시람? 이렇게 황송할 수가 있나, 이런 미천한 곳까지 두 분이 납서 주시다니, 정말 놀라자빠지겠네요!”\\n\\u3000“미스 해비샴이….” 조가 나에게 시선을 고정시킨 채 그때 기억을 또렷이 생각해내려고 애를 쓰는 척하며 말했다. “미스 해비샴이 당신에게 안부를 전해 달라고 각별히 부탁했어. 가만 있자 경의라고 그랬니?  존경이라고  그랬니? 핍?”\\n“경의라고 그랬어요.” 내가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“나도 그거였다고 확신한다.” 조가 대답했다. “그녀가 조 가저리 부 인(주인공의 누나)에게 경의를 전해달라고 나에게 각별히….”\\n\\u3000“흥 그게 내게 무슨 소용이람?” 누나가 발끈하며 말했다. 하지만 속으론 기분이 은근히 좋은 모양이었다.\\n\\u3000“그리고 미스 해비샴(여자이름)이 말을 전해 달라 기를….” 조가 시 선을 또 한 번 나에게 고정시킨 채 그때 기억을 떠올리려고 애를 쓰는 척하며 말했다. “자신의 건강상태가 지금 빌어먹을 상태인지라…, 건강 상태만 허락했었다면…, 응? 그렇지 핍?”(핍은 주인공 꼬마이름)\\n“그녀가 기꺼이 방문을 허락했을 거라고 말했어요.” 내가 덧붙였다. “여기  계신  신사  숙녀  분들의  방문을  허락했을  거라고 말했다오.”\\n조가 말했다. 그리곤 통탄의 한숨을 길게 내뿜었다. \\n\\u3000“이거 참!” 누나가 한 층 누그러진 눈빛으로  펌블추크 씨를 바라다  보며 말했다. “사정이 그렇다면 사람을 시켜  말을  전하면 되잖아요? 그게 더 예의 있지 않나요? 뭐 아무 말도 없는 것보단 말이라도 전해주니 좋기야 하지만서도. 그래 그녀가 이 개구쟁이 녀석에게 뭘 주던 가요?”\\n“그녀는 이 애에게….” 조가 말했다. “아무것도 주지 않았소.”\\n\\u3000조 부인(주인공 꼬마의 친누나, 20살차이)이 폭발하기 일보직전이었다. 조가 황급히 다시 말했다.\\n“그녀가 준 것은,” 조가 말했다. “이 애의 친구들한테 주는 거래.” ‘친구들한테 준다.’라는 말의 의미가 무엇인지 조가 마저 설명하려했\\n다. “그 말은 이 애의 누나인 조 가저리 부인의 손에 주어져야한다는 의미요. 그녀가 분명 그렇게 언급했으니까. ‘제가 말하는 그 분은 조 가저리 부인이에요’라고 말이야. 가만 보니 그녀가 몰랐을 수도 있겠 네….” 조가 또 한 번 심사숙고하는 척 생떼를 쓴 후 이런  말을 덧붙  였다. “내 이름이 조인지 혹은 호르헤인지 말이야.” (조의 포르투갈 식 이름이 ‘호르헤’임. 라틴아메리카에서 흔한 이름. 소설 속에서 외래어를 영어단어와 혼동해 그것을 조크인 양 사용하는 인물이 바로 조임, 자신은 조크라고 생각해서 기껏 말했는데 아무도 웃지 않는 상황을 그 리려고 저자가 의도한 것임. 참고로 조는 소설 속에서 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물임. 주인공의 양심을 지탱해주는 버팀목이지만 주인공이 떠나면서 주인공에게 많은 시련이 옴. 역시 행복은 로또가 아니라 성 실하고 정직하며 온건한 사람들과 교류하는 것임.)\\n\\u3000누나가  펌블추크 씨를 쳐다보았다. 펌블추크 씨는 구미가  당긴다면   서  목재팔걸이의자의  두  팔걸이를  손으로  매만지고  있었다. 펌불추크 씨가 누나에게 고개를 끄떡여 보였다. 그런 후 펌블추크 씨는 또 난로 불을 보면서도 고개를 끄떡여보였다. 마치 지금 벌어지고 있는 이 모든 일들에 대해 자신이 예전에 이미 간파했다는 것을 말하지 못해 안달이 난 것이  분명했다.\\n\\u3000“그래요? 호호 얼마 받으셨는데요?” 누나가 웃으며 말했다. 이제야 조가 뜸을 들이는 이유를 알겠다는 표정이었다.\\n\\u3000“5백만 원을  주더라고 내가 말하면 여기 계신 신사숙년들께선  무어라 말들 하시겠습니까?” 조가 강력한 어조로 질문을 던졌다.\\n\\u3000“이렇게 말하겠지,” 누나가 퉁명스럽게 되받아쳤다. “꽤 괜찮은 금액 이네라고. 지나치게 많지도 않고. 하지만 꽤 괜찮은  금액임에는 분명해.”\\n“그럼 그 이상을 주더라면?” 조가 눈을 반짝이며 말했다.\\n\\u3000그 즉시 ‘저 무시무시한 협잡꾼(사기꾼) 펌블추크’가 고개를 크게 끄떡이며 동시에 손바닥으로 자신이 앉아 있는 목재의자팔걸이를 엄청난 속도로 비비며 환호성을 질렀다. “그 이상이래요, 부인ㅜ_ㅜ.”\\n\\u3000“설마, 지금 저 사람이 진심은 아니겠지요?….” 누나가 펌블추크 씨에게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“저는 모두 알고 있었습니다, 부인.” 펌블추크 씨가 말했다. “잠깐만요 잠깐만 조의 말을 더 들어봅시다. 자 어서 더 말해 보거라, 요셉아.(요셉은 조의 세례명, 펌불추크 씨는 조의 실제 삼촌임) 자 마음을 가라앉히고! 어서! 어서 말해 보거라!”\\n\\u3000“천만 원을 주더라고 제가 말씀드리면 지금 여기에 계신 여러분들은 뭐라 말들 하시겠습니까?” 조가 자신의 말을 계속 이어갔다.\\n“천만 원이라면 아주, 아주 큰돈이지.” 누나가 되받아치며 말했다. “자 그럼,” 조가 말했다. “그녀가 준 돈이 천만 원보다 많답니다.”\\n\\u3000저 비열한 협잡꾼(위선자) 펌블추크가 또 다시 고개를 끄떡였다. 그러더니 자신이 내 은인인 양 웃어 보이더니 이렇게 말했다. “천만 원보다 많답니다, 부인.  그래 요셉 어서  어서  계속 말해 보거라!”  (요셉은 조의 세례명. 펌블추크 씨는 조의 실제 삼촌. 조는 주인공의 매형)\\n\\u3000“그럼 이 얘기의 결말을 짓기 위해 말씀드리자면,” 조가 누나(주인공과 20살차이)에게 봉지를 내밀며 기뻐서 말했다. “자그마치 천 2백 5십 만원이야.”\\n\\u3000“오 이런 천 2백 5십 만원이래요, 부인.” 펌블추크가 누나에게 악수를 청하기 위해 손을 들어 올리며 말했다. 그의 얼굴에는 사기꾼에게서만 볼 수 있는 비열함이 가득했다. “이건 모두 부인의 선행에 대한 보상입니다. 저는 부인이 이런 보상을 받으실 줄 알았습니다. 제 의견을 물으실 때 제가 그렇게 될 거라고 말씀드렸지 않았습니까. 축하드 립니다, 부인.”\\n\\u3000만약 여기서 관두었어도 이 악한(펌블추크)의 행동은 충분히 끔찍했을 텐데. 하지만 이 자는 자신이 마치 내 후원자인 양 나를 강제로 잡아서 자기 쪽으로 끌어당겼고 이건 그가 지금까지 내게 저지른 모든 사기 행각들을 뛰어넘는 것이었다. 그 자는 그렇게 자신의 죄과를 더욱더 검게 덧칠하고  있었다.\\n\\u3000“자 이제부터 마술이 시작됩니다, 친애하는 요셉아 그리고 부인.” 펌 블추크가 한 손으로 내 팔꿈치 위를 붙잡으며 말했다. “저는 일단 시작된 일은 반드시 관철시켜야 직성이 풀리는 그런 사람들 중 한 명입니다. 자 이 소년을 즉시 도제(대장장이 수습공)계약서에 싸인 하게 만듭시다. 그것이 제가 일하는 스타일이니까요. 당장 어서 당장 계약서를 작성하러 갑시다.”\\n\\u3000“하느님도 다 아실 거예요, 펌블추크 삼촌.” 누나가 말했다. 물론 우리 누나는 두 손으로 돈을 꽉 움켜쥔 채 절대 놓지 않으며 말했다. “저희들이 얼마나 많이 삼촌의 신세를 지고 있는지요.”\\n\\u3000“그런 거에 신경 쓰지 마십시오, 부인.” 저 진저리나는 잡곡상(펌블 추크)이 대답했다. “기쁜 일은 이 세상 누구에게나 기쁜 일인 것입니다. 하지만 이 꼬마는, 그러니까, 우리들이 당장 이 애와 계약을 맺어 야합니다. 제가 그리 될 거라고 (요셉과 핍이 도착하기 전에) 부인께 솔직히 다 말씀드리지  않았습니까.”\\n\\u3000집에서 가까운 곳에 시청이 있었다. 시청 안에 판사들이 대기하고 있었기 때문에 우리는 즉시 시청으로 넘어갔다. 이는 모두 나를 조의 도제(대장장이 제자)로 삼기 위해 계약서를 작성해야했기 때문이다. “우리가 시청으로 넘어갔다”라고 내가 방금 말했지만 실은 펌블추크가 나를 밀어 쓰러뜨릴 듯 한 기세로 몰고 간 것이었다. 정확하게 다시 말하자면 마치 남의 호주머니에서 슬쩍 하다가 붙잡혔다거나 혹은 ‘건 초가리’(말린 풀 더미)에 불을 지르다 딱 걸린 아동범죄자를 대우하듯이 딱 그런 대우를 내가 받으며 밀려 쓰러질 듯 시청으로 떠밀려 간 것이다.\\n\\u3000이건 뭐 범정에 있던 사람들의 시선도 만만치 않았는데, 나를 쳐다 보는 그들의 눈빛에는 “저 녀석이 현행범이군.” 딱 이런 눈빛들이었다. 펌블추크가 자기 앞에 나를 밀어 넣으며 군중들 사이를 뚫고 지나갈 때 몇몇 사람들이 말하는 것을 내가 들었기 때문이다. “저 애가 무슨 짓을  저질렀죠?”  그리고  또  다른  사람들이  이렇게  말하는  것도 들렸\\n다. “아직 청소년 같은데, 대개 못되게 생겼네, 그렇죠?”\\n\\u3000그들 중 다소 온순하고 인정 많게 생긴 한 사람이 심지어 내게 글자  체가 화려한 전단지 한 장을 주었을 정도였다. 누가 봐도 딱 소시지 같이 생긴 족쇄(발목 쇠사슬)들을 덮어 쓴 사악하게 생긴 청소년이 목 판화로 그려져 있는 전단지였다. 전단지 제목이 “감방 안에서 읽을 것”이었다. 섬직했다.\\n\\u3000시청은 괴상망측한(이상한) 곳이었다. 어떻게 된 것이 시청좌석이 교 회좌석(벤치)보다 더 높았다. 사람들은 그 좌석 너머에 매달린 채 안을 구경하고 있었다.\\n그 안 풍경도 가관이었는데 잘난척하는 판사들이 상체를 뒤로 푹 젖\\n\\n\\n힌 채 자신들의 의자에 파묻혀 있었고 개중에는 팔짱을 낀 판사도 있   었고 혹은 코담배를 맡고 있는 판사도 있었고 혹은 (너무 같은 자세로 오래 앉아 있어서) 몸이 저려 감각이 없어 보이는 판사도 있었고 혹은 뭔가를 적고 있거나 혹은 신문들을 읽고 있는 판사도 있었다. 판사들  중에 한 명의 머리에는 파우더(화장) 칠이 되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 벽들 위에  몇 점의 검은 초상화들이 반짝이고 있었는데, 예  술에 문외한인 내가 봤을 때 그 초상화들이 꼭 ‘아몬드를 넣은 사탕 과자’와 ‘반창고’의 조합(결합물) 같이 여겨졌다.\\n\\u3000이런 괴상망측한 곳의 한쪽 구석에서, 내  계약서는  적절한  절차에 따라 서명되고 인증되었고  그리고  나는  그렇게 “(법과 의무에) 얽매이 게 되었다.”\\n\\u3000이러는 동안 죽 펌블추크 씨는 나를 붙들고 있었는데 이건 뭐, 사형장에 가다가 사소한 예비 절차를 마무리 짓기 위해 잠시 이곳에 들른 사람인  것 같았다.\\n\\u3000우리(주인공, 매형, 친누나, 매형의 실제 삼촌)가 다시 밖으로 나왔을 때, 내가 공개적으로 처형당하는 꼴을 보게 될 거라고 한껏 기대에 부풀어있던 소년들(시청 밖에 진치고 있던 소년들)이 크게 아쉬워했다. 이번 일은 내 친구들(매형, 친누나, 매형의 삼촌)이 그저 나를 돕기 위해 달려온 것일 뿐이었다는 사실이 알려지자 크게 풀이 죽은 것이다.\\n우리는 그렇게 펌블추크 씨 집으로 다시 돌아왔다.\\n\\u3000그리고 그 곳에서 내 누나는 돈 천 2백 5십 만원에 너무도 광분한 상태가 되어 “제가 오늘 한 턱 쏠게요. 지금 당장 ‘푸른 멧돼지’(식당 이름)로 가자고요. 고고씽~ 이 횡재한 돈으로 제가 오늘 한 턱 쏜다니 까요. 펌블추크 삼촌, 어서 허블 씨 부부(마차바퀴 제조인)와 웹슬 씨 (연극배우를 꿈꾸는 열혈 노총각, 아직은 교회서기)를 삼촌의 2륜 마차 (바퀴 2개)로 데리고 오세요. 호호호. 오예~”라는 제안을 했고 한 턱 쏘겠다는 데 싫어할 사람도  있남.\\n\\u3000모두들 즐거워하며 “오케이”했고 서로들 “사람을 데리러 간다. 식당 좌석을 알아본다.”하며 분주하게  움직였다.\\n\\u3000아(-_-;) 불행히도 그날은 내가 지금까지 겪어본 날들 중에서 가장 우울한 날이었다. 사람들이 술이 한 잔씩 들어가자 정말 이해할 수 없을 정도로까지 마음이 바뀌어선 그것도 일행 모두가 나(주인공)를 마치 이 잔치에 있어 극히 이질적인 존재 그래 꼭 아주 못생긴 사마귀 같이 나를 대했기 때문이다. 나를 그렇게 치부해버리는 걸 아주 당연시 하는 그들의 태도에서 내가 뭘 더 기뻐하겠는가.\\n\\u3000그리고 더 나쁜 것은, 사람들이 이따금씩 요컨대 그들이 달리 할 일이 없을 때마다 내게 “왜 즐거운 시간을 보내지 않니?(왜 음식을 더  먹지 않니?)”라고 묻곤 했고, 나는 또 어쨌든 그런 질문을 받을 때마다 “배 터지게 먹고 있어요.”라는 말밖에 더 할 말이 없었던 것이다. 즐겁지도 않은 날 그런 질문(왜 즐기지 않니?)을 받고서 도대체  내가  무슨 말을 더 할 수 있었겠는가!\\n\\u3000하지만, 그들은 이미 다 성장했고 자신들만의 삶의 방식이 있었다. 그러니 내 기분이야 어떻든 그들이 이 시간을 즐기겠다는데 내가 말릴 자격은 없었다.\\n\\u3000이 모든 횡재와 관련해 자비심 많은 후원자인양 기분이 한껏 의기양 양해진 저 협잡꾼 펌블추크은 실제로도 식탁의 상석을 차지하고 있었고, 내가 이번에 (법과 의무에) 얽매인 것을 주제로 사람들에게 이렇게 말을 하며 좌중을 휘어잡고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“만약 이 애(주인공)가 카드놀이를 한다거나, 혹은 독한 술들을 마신 다거나, 혹은 근무 시간에 늦는다거나 혹은 악당들과 사귄다거나 혹은, 이 애의 도제계약서상에 나와 있듯 이 꼬마가 장차 거의 필연적으로 저지를 것으로 언급되어 있는 기타 엉뚱한 짓들에 이 애가 장차 빠지 기라도 한다면 그 즉시로 이애는 금고형(감옥)에 처해질 겁니다. 오늘 우리가 체결한 계약서가 이를 입증합니다. 여러분. 하하하~”라며 사람 들에게 악마 같은 축하의 인사말들을 수도 없이 건네고 있었다. 더구나 이 협잡꾼(나쁜 사기꾼)은 자신의 논평에 대한 실례를 보여주기 위해 자기 옆에 있는 의자 위로 내가 올라가 서 있도록 강제했던 것이다.\\n\\u3000이 대단한 축제일에 대해 내가 유일하게 기억하는 것들은 다음과 같다. 그들이 내가 자게 내버려두질 않았다는 사실이다. 깜빡 잠이 들어있는 나를 그들이 발견할 때면 어김없이 나를 쿡쿡 찔러대며 깨웠고  내게 “왜 즐기지 않는 거니?(왜 음식을 더 먹지 않니?)”라며 말들 했다.\\n\\u3000결국 느지막한(늦은) 저녁에 웹슬 씨(연극배우를 꿈꾸는 교회서기)가 ‘콜린스’(영국 서정시인)의 “열정에 대한 송시”(‘송시’란 공덕을 기리는 시)를 우리들에게 읊어주다가 “복수”역을 맡은 주인공이 피로 얼룩진 자신의 칼을 천둥 속으로 내던지는 장면을 너무 현실감 있게 연출하려다 보니 큰 소리가 났고, 그래서 아래층에 있던 웨이터가 올라와 우리 들에게  이렇게 말해야했다.\\n\\u3000“아래층에 계신 사장님들께서 경의를  표하더라는  말을  전해달랍니 다. 그리고 덧붙이시기를 식당의 칼은 텀블링(공중제비)을 위해 만들어진 것이 아님을 상기해  달랍니다.”\\n집으로 돌아오는 길 위에서도 사람들은 모두 한껏 기분이 고무된 상\\n태여서 〈 오~ 아름다운 부인이여! 〉 라는 노래를 불렀을 정도다. 노래 의 베이스(저음)를 맡아 부르던 웹슬 씨(교회서기)가 무지막지하게 큰 목소리로 “내가 바로 하얀 머리채를 휘날리던 노래 속 바로 그 사나이다. 그리고 전반적으로 봤을 때 내가 바로 고행에 나섰던 이 세상에서 가장 연약한 순례자다”라며 마구 질러댔다.\\n\\u3000물론 웹슬 씨가 이렇게 고래고래 소리를 질러대며 노래를 부른 것은, 다른 사람들의 사생활에 관한한 모든 것을 알고 싶어서 뻔뻔스런 태도로 노래의 앞부분을 먼저 시작한, 꼬치꼬치 캐묻길 좋아하고 매사에 말이 너무 많아 지겨운 펌블추크에게 화답하기 위해서 웹슬 씨도 목소리를  높인 것이다.\\n\\u3000마지막으로 내가 기억하는 것은 다음과 같다. “내가 내 조그만 한 침대로 들어와 누웠을 때엔 내가 정말이지 비참한 기분이었다는 것이다. 무엇보다 내가 조의 직업(대장장이)을 좋아하지 않을 것이 확실했다. 적어도 그런 강한 죄의식이 들었다.”\\n\\u3000한때는(더 어릴 적에는) 나도 그 직업(대장장이)을 좋아했었다. 하지만 과거가 현재는 될 수 없는 것이다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 14장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000자기 집을 부끄럽게 여긴다는 것은 이 세상에서 가장 비참한 일이다. 그 감정에는 배은망덕함이 녹아있을 수 있으니 당사자는 응당 처벌을 받아야하며 당연히 그리되어야한다. 하지만 내가 입증할 수 있는 것은 그것이 비참한 감정이라는  것이다.\\n\\u3000누나는  화를 자주  냈다. 그  때문에 우리 집은 결코 내게 아주 즐거운 곳이 아니었다. 하지만 조(주인공의 매형)는 그런 집을 신성하게 만들 줄 알았고 그래서 난 우리 집이 좋다고 믿었었다(에스텔라를 만난 이후로는 믿지 않는다는  의미).\\n\\u3000나는 우리 집 응접실이 이 세상에서 가장 우아한 응접실이라고 믿었 었고, 우리 집 대문이 사람들이 엄숙하게 열고 들어가 통째 구운 새고기들을 희생물로 바치는 종교 교당(사원)으로 통하는 신비한 정문이라고 믿었었다.\\n\\u3000나는 우리 집 부엌이 참으로 아름다운 방은 아니지만 나름 정숙한 곳이라 믿었었고, 우리 집 대장간이 남자다움과 자립으로 나를 이끌 비까번쩍한  도로라고 믿었었다.\\n\\u3000하지만  단 1년 만(주인공이 에스텔라를 알게  된 10개월만)에 이 모든 것들이 변하고 말았다. 이제 이 모든 것들은 내게 있어 그저 거칠고 천하며 평범하기 그지없는 주변물들이 되고 말았고, 난 어떤 이유가 있더라도 이러한 것들(주인공의 집)을 미스 해비샴과 에스텔라에게 보여주고  싶지 않았다.\\n\\u3000이런 버릇없고 무례한 내 마음들 중 얼마나 많은 요소들이, 내 자신의 잘못 탓이고 또 얼마나 많은 요소들이 미스 해비샴의 잘못인지, 그 리고 내 누나가 이 모든 것들을 악화시킨 장본인은 아닌지를 지금 이 순간 따져보는 것은 나에게 있어서도 그리고 어느 누구(주인공, 주인공의 누나, 미스 해비샴)에게 있어서도 중요하지 않다.\\n\\u3000내 안에 있는 모든 것들이 변했고, 일은 이미 벌어진 직후라는 것이다. 그것이 옳은 방향으로 향했던 잘못된 방향으로 향하고 있었든, 그 변화에 변명의 여지가 있던 혹은 그 변화가 용서될 수 없는 것이었든, 그것은  이미 변했다.\\n\\u3000한때는, 나도 내가 마침내 셔츠 소매들을 걷어 올리고 대장간  안으로 들어가 조(매형, 대장장이)의 수습공(제자)이 되는 것이 내 삶의 성공이고 행복이라고 여긴 적이 있었다. 하지만 지금 이렇게 그것이 손에 잡힐 정도의 현실이 되자 “나는 이제 작은 석탄 먼지들로 먼지투성이가 되었다는 감정”과 “모루(쇳덩이받침대)의 무게를 깃털 하나의 무게로 여겨지게 만드는 추(쇠) 하나가 매일 매일 나를 내리누르고 있다는 감정”만을 느낄  뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000후년에(나중에) 가서 두꺼운 장막이 내 삶의 재미와  로맨스 위로 덮쳐, 윤기 없는 인내의 시간들을 제외하곤 내 주변 모든 것들로부터 차단당해있다고 내가 느끼던 때가 있었다. 그런 감정은 대다수 사람들도 마찬가지로 한 번씩 느꼈으리라  생각한다.\\n\\u3000내 삶의 경로에 있어서 내 눈 앞에 조의 수습공이 되기 위한 길이 새로 활짝 펼쳐진 이때만큼이나 그 장막의 무게와 공허함을 내가 느꼈던 적은 결코  없었다.\\n\\u3000나는 기억한다. 내 수습공 시절의 후반부에 밤이 내리누르는 일요일 저녁이면 난 내 자신의 전망(미래)과 바람 부는 습지대의 풍경을 서로 비교했었고, 이들 둘 사이가 평평함과 낮음에 있어서 얼마나 유사한지 그리고 이들 둘 다 알 수 없는 길과 짙은 안개 그리고 바다로 어어 지고 있음을 헤아려보면서 (부모님과, 너무 어렸을 때 죽었다는 내 다섯 형제들이 잠들어 있는) 교회 부속의 묘지 주변을 서성이곤 했다.\\n\\u3000수습공생활 후반부에 내가 실의에 빠져 있던 것만큼이나 수습공생활 첫날 나는 분명 실의에  빠져있었었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 내 계약기간이 지속되는 동안 조(매형)에겐 단 한 마디도 불 평하지 않았는데 난 아직도 이것을 아주 기쁘게 생각한다. 이것이 아마도 이 시절에 있어 내가 내 자신에 대해 던지는 유일한 칭찬이다. \\n\\u3000왜냐하면, 내가 이후 덧붙일 이야기들 안에 그것이(이렇게 말하는 이 유가) 포함되겠지만 내가 앞으로 밝힐 모든 공적의 주인공은 내가 아니라 조(매형)이기 때문이다. 불행히도 이때의 나는 그것을 알기에는 미약한 존재였다. 그것이 내 불행의 원인 중 하나였을 것이다.\\n\\u3000내가 대장간에서 달아나 군대에 입대하거나 바다로 나가 선원이 되지 않은 것은 모두 조가 내 앞에서 보여준 두터운 신의 때문이었다.  내가 내 직업에 충실했기 때문이 아니다.\\n\\u3000대장장이가 내 기질에 맞지 않았음에도 내가 이 직업을 수습기간이  끝날 때까지 참고 견뎌낼 수 있었던 것도 모두 조가 내 앞에서 보여준 노동에 관한 강인한 믿음 때문이었다. 내가 근면해서가 아니었다.\\n\\u3000“온화하고 정직하며 부드러운 마음씨를  가진  사람들의 영향이  얼마나 멀리까지 미칠 수 있는지 그로 인해 얼마나 많은 것들이 변화할 수 있는지 여기서 그것을 단정하는 것은 쉽지 않다.”(←정말정말정말 좋은 문장임. 너무 감동 받아서 잠시 심호흡 중임~ ㅜ_ㅜ.. 공감 200%+300%+1000% 그래서 이  소설의  주제가  “행복이란  일생에 한 번 있을까 말까한 큰 요행을 경험하는 것이 아니라 작지만 소중한 생   활을 즐기며, 진실하고 성실하며 정직한 사람들과 맺는 인간관계에 있 다.”임. 찰스 디킨스의 『 위대한 유산 』 은 제가 좋아할 요소들이 곳곳 에 널려 있네요. 좋은 징조임~) 하지만 이거 하나만은 확실히 말할 수 있다. 적어도 그 영향이 내 앞을 스쳐지나갔을 때 내 심장이 얼마나 많이 떨렸었는지를 내 마음이 얼마나 편안함을 맛보았었는지. 이것을 아는 것은 아주 쉬운 일이다.\\n\\u3000내 수습공 시절과 관련해 좋은 것이 하나라도 내게 있었다면 그것은 매사에 출세 지향적이고 쉼 없이 안절부절 못하며 불평불만을 품고 있던 내가 아니라 오로지 자기 삶에 충실하고 꾸밈없는 모습을 보여주었던 조(매형)의 영향 덕이었음을 나는 잘 알고 있다.\\n\\u3000이때 당시 내가 원하던 것을 누가 내게 말해줄 수 있겠는가? 나도 모르던 사항들에 대해 그걸 누가 지금 다시 말해줄 수 있겠는가? “이때 당시  내가 가장 두려워하던 것은”  어떤 운 나쁜 시간에,  내가 천하고 더러운 장소(대장간)에 서 있을 때, 내 눈을 들어 올렸을 때 대장간 목재창문들 중 하나 너머로 이 안을 들여다보고 있는 “에스텔라를 발 견하는 것이었다.”\\n\\u3000나는 머잖아 그녀가 나를 찾아올 것이며 그렇게 되면  검게 변한 얼굴과 두 손을 한 채 이 이 직업 중에서도 가장 천한 작업을 도맡아 하고 있는 나를 적발할 것이며, 그럼 그녀는 크게 기뻐하며 나를 경멸의 눈초리로 내려다볼 거라는 불안에 시달리고 있었다.\\n\\u3000종종 날이 어두워진 후, 내가 조(매형)를 돕기 위해 풀무(바람통을 움직여 화로의 불 키우기)질을 하고 있을 때에도, 그리고 우리가 ‘클레멘 타인’(노동자들 민요)이라는 노래를 함께 부를 동안에도, 그래서 ‘그러고 보니 미스 해비샴의 집에서도 이 노래를 같이 불렀는데.’라는 생각이 들어 불 속에서 에스텔라의 얼굴이 보이는 것 같을 때에도,  그리고 그녀의 아름다운 머릿결이 바람에 나부끼는 것 같을 때에도, 그리고 그녀가 두 눈 가득 나를 경멸의 시선으로 바라보며 서 있는 것 같을 때에도, 그런 때는 나는 목재  창문들을 쳐다보곤  했고  보이는 것 은 검은 밤의 장막들뿐이었음에도 그녀가 막 창문에서 얼굴을 돌렸다는 착각이 들어 그녀가 기어이 내 천한 상태를 확인하기 위해 찾아왔구나 하고 믿곤 하는 것이다.\\n\\u3000그 후, 우리(조와 주인공)가  저녁  식사를  위해  집안으로  들어갔을 때, 집과 식사는 이전보다 더 초라하게 여겨지곤 했고, 그리고 집도 이 전보다 더 부끄럽게 여겨지곤 했다.\\n\\u3000자신을 키워준 사람들과 자신의 어린 시절을 함께해온 집을 초라하고 부끄럽게 여기는 배은망덕한 아이, 그것이 이때 당시의 나였다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 15장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000웹슬 씨의 ‘대고모’(‘웹슬 씨의 아버지’의 고모)가 운영하는 저녁학교에 다니기에는 내가 너무 커버렸다. 그래서 상식을 벗어난 여성 아래에서의 교육도 자연스레 종결짓게 되었다.\\n\\u3000다만 내가 저녁학교를 그만 둔 것은, 내가 비디(여자조연, 아름답진않고 평범한 외모, 저녁학교 선생님)에게서 그녀가 알고 있던 모든 지식을 전수받고 난  직후였다.\\n\\u3000나는 비디에게서 조그만 한 가격목록 표 보는 법부터 시작해서 그녀가 예전에 천원을 주고 샀다고 하는 ‘코믹 송’(익살스러운 노래)을 부르는 법까지 죄다  배웠다.\\n\\u3000코믹 송의 경우 비록 논리적인 부분이 오프닝부분 단 몇 줄뿐이었지만 말이다. 그땐 코믹 송도 문학작품의 일종이라고 여겼기 때문에 외우면서도 내 자부심은  대단했다.\\n코믹 송 오프닝 부분의 가사를 몇 줄을 인용하면 다음과 같다.\\n\\u3000“큰 맘 먹고 런던 시내로 놀러갔다네. 룰루랄라~ 룰루랄라~. 가다가 돌아왔다네. 룰루랄라~ 룰루라라~ 나름 생각해서 내린 결정이었다네.  룰루랄라~ 룰루랄라~”\\n\\u3000역시 코믹 송답다. 하지만 똑똑해지고 싶다는 열망이 너무도 강했기 때문에 묵직하게도 나는 이 곡을 다 외웠다. 하지만 노래가사에 “룰 루”라는 단어가 왜 이렇게 많이 등장하는지 헷갈렸다. 하지만 이 곡의 문학적 가치에 대해선 추호의 의구심도 품지 않았다.\\n\\u3000정보에 굶주려 있던 나는 결국 웹슬 씨(연극배우를 꿈꾸는 열혈 노총각, 아직까지는 교회서기, 뭐 어쨌든 나중에는 런던연극계에 진출 함^^스마일~)를 찾아가 이렇게  제안했다.\\n“지식의 부스러기라도 좋으니 아저씨의 지식을 제게 전수해주세요.”\\n그도 이것을 흔쾌히  승낙했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 곧 판명 났다. 그는 나를 제자로 받아들인 것이 아니었다. 단지 자신의 런던연극계 진출을 위한 대사연습용 상대로 나를 정했을 뿐 이었다. 지식의 전수니 뭐니 할 것도 없었다.\\n\\u3000그는 연극대사를 읊으며 내게 갑자기 호통을  치는가  하면,  갑자기 나를 껴안기도 하고, 또 갑자기 혼자서 악이 바쳐 울음을 터뜨리기도  하며 나를 혼란스럽게 했다. 더구나 어떤 때는 나를 움켜잡기도 하고 괴롭히기도 하고 쿡쿡 찌르기도 하는 등 내 주위를 돌아다니며 아주 다양한 방식으로 부산을 떨었다. 즉 나를 마구 괴롭혔다는 얘기다.\\n사정이 이러니 나도 곧 그의 교육과정을 거부할 수밖에 없었다.\\n\\u3000물론 내가 그의 교육과정을 그만 둔 시점이 내가 시인의 열 분에 휩싸인 웹슬 씨에게서 괴롭힘을 마구 당한 이후였지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000내가 얻은 지식은 무엇이든 조(주인공의 매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물)에게 전수해주고 싶었다. 이렇게만 말하면 내게 무슨 선한 마음이 있었던 것 같지만…, 양심상 다 말하는 게 낫겠다.\\n\\u3000조는 착하지만 많이 어리숙했다. 조를 조금만 덜 어리숙하게 보이게끔 그래서 보다 평범하게 보이게 하고 싶었다. 그럼 나하고도 더 잘  어울릴 테고, 에스텔라가 우리를 발견했을 때 덜 경멸할 테니까.\\n\\u3000습지대에는 포병부대가 버리고 간 ‘오래된 포대’가 하나 있었다. 그 곳이 우리의 스터디장소였다. ‘깨진 석판 하나’와 ‘짤막한 석필 하나’가 우리의 학습도구였다. 조는 여기에다 담배 파이프 한 개를 항상 추가 했다.\\n\\u3000내 지도 하에서 그리고 그 학습내용이 무엇이었든지 간에 조(매형) 가 과연 일요일 날 배웠던 내용을 그 다음날까지도 기억했는지는 나로 서도 알 수가  없다.\\n\\u3000그렇지만 그는 포대에 앉아서 다른 어떤 장소에서보다 훨씬 더 현명한 모습으로 담배를 피우곤 했었고 어떤 때는 학식 있는 사람의 분위기를 풍기곤 했다. 마치 자신의 학습이 그 날 그 날 엄청난 진보를 보인 것을 축하하는 양  말이다.\\n내 소중한 동료, 학습에 진전이 있었길 바란다. \\n\\n\\u3000(주인공은 이제 꼬마가 아님, 15세 가량임, 나이가 정확히 생각이 안 나네요-_-; 아직 꼬마인가? 15세 맞나? 잊었네...이런. 여하튼 시간이 흐르고  있는

때면 돛들이 해안가 바닥 위에 뜬 채 여전히 바다로 향하고 있는 것처럼 보였다. 마치 난 파당한  배들처럼 말이다.\\n\\u3000새하얀 돛들을 활짝 펼칠 채 해안가에서 앞바다 쪽으로 나아가고 있는 배들을 바라볼 때면 나는 웬일인지 미스 해비샴과 에스텔라가 떠오 르곤 했다.\\n\\u3000그리고 햇살이, 구름 위를 혹은 모래 위를 혹은 초록색 언덕 위를 또는 해수면 위를 비스듬히 내려와 세차게 부딪쳐 날릴 때면 나는 또한 그녀들을 생각하곤 했다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴과 에스텔라 그리고 큰 저택과 그녀들의 낮선 생활방식은, 지금 내 눈앞에 그림처럼 펼쳐져 있는 이 풍경들과 어떤 연관성이 있는 것만 같았기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000어느 일요일이었을 것이다. 몹시도 즐겁게 담배를 피워대던 조가 자신이 아둔함 가지고 너무나 위세(뽐내기)를 떨어대는 바람에 그 날 수업은 그만하기로 한 날이었다.\\n나는 아까부터 손으로 턱을 괜 채 토루(방어용 둑) 위에 누워 있었다. 그러다 모든 풍경 속에서 그리고 하늘에서 그리고 수면 위에서 미스 해비샴과 에스텔라의 흔적을 불현듯 보게 되었다.\\n\\u3000결국 나는 머릿속으로 오랫동안 간직해왔었던 생각하나를 조에게 공개적으로  말해보기로 결심했다.\\n\\u3000“조.” 내가 말했다. “내가 미스 해비샴을 한 번 찾아봬야하지 않을까?”\\n\\u3000“글쎄다, 핍.”(핍은 주인공이름) 조가 대답했다. 천천히 하지만 깊은 사색 후에 조가 대답했다. “방문 목적은 뭐라고 할 거니?”\\n“방문 목적이 뭐라니, 조? 방문에 꼭 이유가 있어야 하는 건 아냐!” “그런  종류의  질문을 절대  피할 수  없는  방문이  있단다, 핍. 아마도\\n이 경우엔 말이다.” 조가 대답했다. “네가 미스 해비샴을 방문하는 문제에 대해서라면…. 네가 뭔가를 바란다고 그녀가  생각하지  않겠니? 네가 그녀에게서 뭔가를 바란다고  말이다.”\\n“아무 것도 바라지 않는다고 말하면 되잖아, 응? 조?”\\n\\u3000“그래 네 녀석은 그러고도 남을 아이지.” 조가 대답했다. “그녀도 널 신용할거다. 물론 똑같은 이유로 널 신용하지 않을 수도 있을 테고.”\\n\\u3000조는 자신의 주장이 정당하다고 느꼈고 사실 그대로였다. 반복해서 말함으로써 자신의 주장이 약해지는 것을 막기 위해 조는 담배를 깊숙이  빨아 당겼다(피웠다).\\n\\u3000“알겠니? 핍.” 말을 반복하는 위험에서 벗어나자마자 조가 설득조로 말했다. “미스 해비샴은 네게 관대하게 행동했다. 미스 해비샴이 네게 후한 보수를 준 날 나를 따로  불러  이렇게  말하더구나.  ‘그게  다’라 고.”\\n“그래, 조. 나도 그녀가 말하는 것을 들었어.” “‘그게 다’라고.” 조가  힘주어  되풀이했다. “내가 말했잖아, 나도  들었다고.”\\n\\u3000“내가 말하고 싶은 건 말이다, 핍, ‘그게 다’란 말의 의미는 ‘그게 다’라는 것이다. 그것으로 끝! 알겠니? 난 북쪽으로, 넌 남쪽으로! 더이상 볼 일 없다! 뭐 이거지!”\\n\\u3000나도 그렇게 생각했었다. 조도 그렇게 생각했었다니(-_ㅜ;)  하지만 그런 대답은 내게 아무런 도움이 되지 못했다. 단지 내 생각을 재확인 했을 뿐이다.\\n“하지만, 조.”\\n“그래, 얘야.”\\n\\u3000“난 이제 막 내 수습기간 중 첫 번째 해를 성공적으로 보냈어(←이 것으로 주인공의 나이가 분명해졌음. 주인공나이 12살임). 수습공 계약을 맺던 날 이후로 한 번도 찾아뵙지 못했잖아. 고맙다는 말도 못했고 안부를 여쭙지도 못했고 항상 고마워하고 있다는  말도  전하지  못했 고.”\\n\\u3000“그건 사실이구나, 핍. 하지만 네가 곡선으로 된 유리 편자(말발굽 보호용 쇳조각)를 그녀에게 선물로 주지 못할 바에야. 내 말의 의미는 유리 편자도 그녀에겐 선물이 못 될 거란 얘기란다. 그녀에겐 발굽이 없으니까.”\\n\\u3000“그런 종류의 인사를 드리겠다는 게 아냐, 조. 내가 말한 건 선물이 아니라고.”\\n\\u3000하지만 선물에 대한 생각이 조(주인공의 매형)의 머릿속을 점령한 상태였다. 조는 같은 말을  되풀이했다.\\n\\u3000“심지어…,” 조가 말했다. “만약 네가 그녀 방문에 달 도어체인(방범용 문의 쇠사슬)을 뚝딱 만들어준다면 모를까… 아니지 다용도로도 쓸 수 있는 상어머리 나사못 144개나 2백 개쯤 만들어주는 게 낫겠네, 아니지 예쁜 의장품을 몇 개 만들어 선물로 드린다거나, 그것도 아니면 머핀(작고 둥근 빵)을 찍어먹을 수 있게 포크를 만들어드린다거나… 그것도 아니면 작은  청어를  구워먹을  수  있게  석쇠(굽는  기구) 같은 걸  뚝딱 만들어준다면….”\\n“내가 말한 건 선물이 아니래도, 조.” 내가 참지 못하고 말했다. “글쎄다.”  조가 말했다.\\n내가 그게 아니라고 분명 강조했음에도 조는 막무가내였다.\\n\\u3000조가 계속 말했다. “만약 내가 너라면 말이다, 핍(주인공꼬마이름, 12세). 나는 다른 걸 선물할거란다. 암 다른 걸 만들어드리고말고. 도 어체인은 항상 사용하는 게 아니잖니, 상어머리 나사는 실패할 확률이 높고. 찍어먹는 포크? 포크라면 놋쇠로 만들어야 할 텐데 놋쇠를 그녀 에게 선물 할 순 없지. 석쇠도 마찬가지다. 솜씨 좋은 장인이 기량을 뽐내기에는 석쇠도 적절한 물건이 아니지 않니? 석쇠야 잘 만들어봤자 그저  석쇠일 뿐이니까.”\\n\\u3000내가 분명히 아니라고 누누이 강조했음에도 조의 선물 이야기는 계 속되었다. 마치 조가 내 생각 중 고정된 망상 부분을 꺼내길 원하는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000조가 말했다. “내 얘기는, 네가 그녀를 생각해 선물을 드린다고 하더 라도, 석쇠는 그저 석쇠로 판명 날 뿐이라는 것이다. 네가 의도하든 의도하지 않던 말이다. 너도 어쩔 수 없는 일이란다, 핍.” \\n\\u3000 “그만, 조.” 자포자기식 감정이 들어 내가 그의 소매를 잡으며 말했다. “그런 선물을 드리러 가는 게 아니야 아니라니깐. 그냥 안부인사만 여쭈고  나올 거야.”\\n\\u3000“그래, 핍.”(핍은 주인공꼬마이름, 12살) 조가 찬성했다. 하지만 그 어조에는 내가 지금까지 말한 게 그거야 라는 의미가  담겨  있었다.  “내가 말하고 싶은 건, 네가 잘 생각할거라는 거야, 핍.”\\n\\u3000“내가 뭘?  뭘 조. 내가 말하고 싶었던 건 요즘 일도 느슨하고 하니깐 조가 내게 내일 반나절 동안의 휴식을 줄 수 있느냐 야. 그 시간이면 충분히 읍 외곽으로 나가 미스 에스테… 아니 해비샴 마님을 만나고 올 수  있으니까.”\\n\\u3000“아니 그게 그녀의 이름이었니?” 조가 진지하게 말했다. “에스타비 샴(에스텔라+해비샴)이 그녀 이름이었니? 그녀가 그 사이에 개명을 하지 않았다면야….”\\n\\u3000“알아, 나도 내가 말실수 한 걸 안다고, 조(매형이름). 그러니까 응? 내가 방금 제안한 거 어떻게 생각해? 내 조퇴 말이야 어?”\\n\\u3000요컨대, 조는 내가 그러고 싶다면 자신도 그게 좋겠다고 생각한다고 말했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 조는 한 가지 까다로운 조건을 달았는데 다음과 같다. “만약 네 방문이 그녀(미스 해비샴, 갑부 미망인)에게서 아무런 호의를 받지 못한다면, 그리고 네 방문이 어떤 목적을 위해서가 아니라 단지 1년 전 그녀에게서 받았던 호의(1천2백 만 원)에 대한 감사인사라는 것이 받아들여지지 않는다면 그래서 그녀가 네 재방문을 달 가와 하지 않는다면 너의 이번 실험은 이번 한 번으로 그쳐야 할 거야. 내 말 무슨 뜻인지 알겠지, 이  친구야?”\\n나는 그러겠다고 약속했다. \\n\\u3000지금, 조(주인공의 매형)는 주급(일주일 수당)을 주면서 제구실을  하는 장인 한 명을 쓰고 있었다. 그의 이름은 올릭(악당, 이름 기억하셔야 함, 주인공의 누나를 해치고 주인공을 일생일대  위기로  몰아넣는 악한, 뭐 이런 사람이 현실에 많은 것이 한이지만)이었다. 자칭 “내 세 례명은 돌지다”라고 온 마을에 떠벌리고 다니는 인물이었다. “세례명이 돌지”라는 것은 명백한 거짓말이었다. (“돌지”라는 이름에 특별한 의미는 없음. 올릭이 마을 사람들에게 섬뜩한 인상을 주려고 지어낸 이름임)\\n\\u3000올릭은 완고한(양보하지 않는) 성격의 사내였다. 따라서 그가 자신의 “세례명이 돌지”라고 주장하고 다녔다면 그것은 그가 어떤 망상의 희 생양이 되었기 때문에 그렇게 우기고 돌아다닌 것이 아니라는 얘기이다.\\n\\u3000이건 마을 사람들의 이해력에 대한 모욕의 의미를 담아 고의적으로 자신의 세례명을 “돌지”라고 주장하고 다닌 것이다.\\n\\u3000그는 어깨가 넓고 움직임이 유연한 사내였다. 얼굴이 까무잡잡한 괴력의 소유자이기도 했고 결코 서두르는 법이 없는 그리고 몸을 항상 앞으로 수그린 채 그렇게 축 처진 자세로 걷는 사내였다.\\n\\u3000그는 심지어 대장간에 일을 하러 올 때조차도 결코 일하러 온 자세가 아니었다. 단지 어쩌다 대장간에 들린 사람마냥 몸을 수그린 채 들 어왔다.\\n\\u3000그는 '세 명의 쾌활한 바지선 선원들'(술집)에 정식(하루 중 가장 많이 먹는 밥)을 먹으러 갈 때조차도 혹은 야간에 어딘가를 갈 때조차도 몸을 앞으로 수그린 채 카인(성경에 나오는 살인자)이 동생(아벨)을 죽이듯 유대인이 방랑의 길을 떠나던 것처럼 어깨를 축 늘어뜨린 자세로 걷곤 했다. 마치 자신이 어디로 갈지 어디로 되돌아와야 하는지를 전혀 모르는 사람  같았다.\\n\\u3000그는 멀리 습지대 위에 있는, 수문지기의 집(소설 후반부에 주인공이 위기를 겪게 되는 장소)에서 숙박을 하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000주중(출근)이면 자신의 오두막에서 몸을 앞으로 수그린 채 어깻죽지가 축 늘어뜨리고 걸어오곤 했다. 양 손을 호주머니에 찔러 넣은 채, 목에다 도시락 끈을 둘러맨 채 도시락을 등 뒤로 대롱대롱 달로서 출 근하곤 했다.\\n\\u3000그는 일요일이면 갑문(물의 유량을 조절하는 수문) 위에 하루 종일  누워 있곤 했다. 아니면 건초가리들(말린 풀 더미)이나 헛간들에 기대   서  있곤 했다.\\n\\u3000그는 항상 구부정한 자세로 시선을 땅에다 고정시킨 채 기관차처럼  걷곤 했으며, 누가 자신을 부르거나 혹은  어쩔  수 없이  고개를 들어야 할 상황이면 반쯤은 분개한 자세로 반쯤은 곤혹스럽다는 표정으로 고  개를 들어 올리곤 했는데 그건 마치 자신의 머릿속에 있는 유일한 생각이 다음과 같다는 것을 증명하는 것 같았다. ‘내가 생각이란 것을 결코 해보지 않네. 이런 기묘하고 유해한 사실이 있나!’\\n\\u3000이 성미 까다로운 장인(대장장이)은 나를 좋아하지 않았다. 내가 아주 어리고 겁이 많던 꼬마였을 때에도 그는 나에게 “저 어두컴컴한 대장간 구석에 악마가 살고 있다. 난(올릭) 그 친구를 잘 알지”라고 믿게 만들었고, “7년에 한 번씩은 살아 있는 소년으로 화로에 불을 지핀다.    내 생각엔 이번엔 네(주인공꼬마)가 그 연료가 될 것 같다.”라는 말로  나를 거의 공포에 휩싸이게  했었다.\\n\\u3000내가 이제 조(주인공의 매형)의 수습공이 되자, 올릭은 아마 내가 자 신의 자리를 대신할 거라고 의심을 확신한 것 같다. 비록 그가 날 덜 좋아했지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000그렇다고 그가 한 번이라도 내게 뭔 말을 한다거나 혹은 어떤 행동을 함으로써 자신의 적의를 공개적으로 드러낸 적은 없었다. 다만 그가 항상 불꽃들을 내 쪽으로 튀기는 것을 보고서 그리고 내가 ‘클레멘 타인’(노동자들 노래)을 부를 때마다 그가 박자가 맞지 않게 끼어드는 것을 보고 그가 내게 적의를 품고 있음을 알았을 뿐이다.\\n\\u3000다음 날 나는 조(매형이자 마스터, 대장자이)에게 반나절 휴가에 관해 상기시켜주었다. 그때 ‘돌지 올릭’(악당, ‘올릭’이 이름 ‘돌지’는 별 명)도 그 자리에서 작업  중이었다.\\n\\u3000올릭은 그 순간에는 아무런 말이 없었는데 왜냐하면 조와 자기 사이에 불덩어리가 된 쇳조각 하나를 막 올려놓은 상태였기 때문이다. 물론 나는 그때 풀무를 이용해 화로에 바람을 넣어주고 있었다.\\n머지않아 올릭이  들고  있던  해머로  쇳조각을  후려갈기며  말했다. “젠장 할, 마스터! 우리들 하나만 편애하시면 안 됩니다. 저 어린 핍\\n(주인공이름)이 반나절 휴가면 이 늙어빠진 올릭도 반나절 휴가를 주 셔야죠.”\\n\\u3000당시 그의 나이는 25세 정도였지만 그는 자신이 고대인(옛날사람)인   양 증명하려는 버릇이  있었다.\\n“왜, 반나절 휴가를 받게, 뭐 하려고 그러나?” 조가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이런 세상에 제가 뭐하려고 그르냐고요! 그럼 저 녀석은 뭐 할 건 데요? 저도 저 녀석만큼 할 일이 많다고요.” 올릭이 말했다.\\n“핍(주인공이름)은 읍에 가봐야 하네.” 조가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“잘 됐군요! 늙어빠진 이 올릭도 읍에 갈 겁니다.” 조의 말을 반박하며 올릭이 말했다. “둘 다 읍으로 가는 겁니다. 한 놈만 읍에 갈 순 없 습니다.”\\n“화내지 말게.” 조가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“이런 젠장, 화는 내고 싶을 때 제가 낼 겁니다.” 올릭이 으르렁거리며 계속 말했다. “한  사람만  읍에  가느냐!  두  사람  다  읍에 가느냐! 자, 마스터! 어서요. 이 대장간 안에서 편애는 절대 용납될 수 없습니다.  당당(공평)하게 구세요!”\\n\\u3000조는 거부했다. 올릭(사악한 악당)의 기분이 더 좋아질 때까지 이 주 제(반나절의 휴가)를 가지고 더 이상 얘기하는 것을 거절했다. 그러자 올릭이 용광로로 돌진해서는 시뻘겋게  달아오른 쇠지렛대를 꺼내 그걸로 나를 찔러 죽이려는 듯이 달려들었다. 그러더니 작대기를 내 머리 주위로 재빨리 한 번 내두르고는 모루(물건을 올려놓고 해머 질을 할   수 있는, 대장간 쇠 받침대) 위에 쇠지렛대를 올려놓고는 해머 질을 해 대기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000쇠지렛대가 나(주인공)이고 미친 듯이 튀기고 있는 불꽃들이 내(주인 공) 핏자국들인 양 올릭은 해머 질을 해댔다. 결국  해머 질로 자신의  몸을 후끈 달아오르게 한 후 그리고 달구어진 쇠지렛대를 물에 넣고  식인 후 올릭이 마지막으로 자신의 해머로 쇠지렛대를 한 번 더 후려 갈기며  이렇게 말했다.\\n“자 이제 다 됐습니다,  마스터!”\\n“이젠 괜찮아졌는가?” 조가 따지듯  물었다.\\n\\u3000“아! 괜찮아졌습니다.” 자칭 늙어빠진 올릭(25세)이 거친  숨소리를 내며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그렇다면, 대체로 봤을 때 자네도 다른 직공들처럼 이 어려운 일을 지금까지 참고 계속해 왔으므로,” 조가 말했다. “오늘은 자네에게도 반 나절의  휴가를 주겠네.”\\n\\u3000이 모든 소동이 벌어지는 동안 누나(주인공의 친누나, 20살차이)가 안뜰에서 가만히 엿들으며 서 있었다. 누난 가장 거리낌 없는 스파이이자  도청자였으니까.\\n\\u3000사태(직공 두 명이 동시에 휴가)를 파악한  누나가  그  즉시 창문을 통해 대장간 안을 들여다보며 조(누나의 남편)에게 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“야 이 등신아! 저런 게으른 궁둥이들에게 휴가를 주면 어떡해. 퍽이나 인심 쓴다 이 인간아. 당신 자신부터 챙겨야 하는 거 아냐. 그딴 식으로 직공들(핍과 올릭) 월급을 낭비 하다니. 내가 저것들(주인공과 올릭) 마스터여야 하는  건데!”\\n\\u3000“흥, 마스터가 될 수 있다면 한 번 돼보라지.” 올릭(25세)이 히죽거리며 불쾌하다는 듯  대꾸했다.\\n“그녀를 내버려두게, 올릭.” 조(주인공의 매형)가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“너희들 같은 머저리들과 사기꾼들은 언제든지 상대해주지.” 누나가 지나치게 화를 내기 시작하며 응수했다. “나는 머저리들의 왕 노릇을  하고 있는 너희들의 마스터와 먼저 맞장 뜨지 않고는 네 놈을 상대할  수 없어. 영국과 프랑스를 통틀어 가장 악하고 기분 나쁘게 생긴 네 놈과 맞장 뜨지 않고는 다른 녀석들을 상대할 수도 없고. 잠 덤벼 이 놈아!”\\n\\u3000“이런 젠장 할, 더럽게 바가지를 긁어 대는 여자네. 엄마처럼 굴지 마란 말이야.” 올릭이 으르렁거리며 말했다. “그 딴 걸로 악인을 찾아낼 수 있다면 저 ○이 딱 그 짝이겠네, 젠장 할.”\\n\\u3000“그녀를 내버려두라고 내가 분명 말했을 텐데, 올릭.” 조가 굳은 표 정으로 말했다.\\n\\u3000“너 방금 뭐라고 지껄였어? 뭐 ○!” 누나가 고함을 질러댔다. 누나의 목소리는 이제 새된 목소리 마냥 거칠어지고  있었다.  “너 이 자식아 지금 뭐라고 말했냐니까? 핍(누나의 친동생, 20살 아래)아, 저 놈이 지금 나한테 뭐라고 그런 거냐? 네(올릭)가 지금 나한테 욕을 해, 내  남  편이 여기 있는데? 오 이런! 어떻게 이런 일이! 아!”\\n이제 누나의 말 한 마디 한 마디는 비명이 되어가고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 이제까지 만나왔던 난폭한 여성들의 경우 똑같이 적용가능 한  진실 하나를 찾을 수 있었다. 격렬하고 갑작스러워 억누르기 어려운 감정을 그녀들의 실수로만 감싸줄 순 없다는 것이다. 이는 내 누나의 경우에도 마찬가지다. 자기감정을 좀 더 차분하고 조용한 상태로 차츰 누그러뜨리려 가는 것이 아니라, 의식적이고 고의적으로  자기감정을  격정 속으로 강제로 밀어 넣는 힘든 수고를 보였기 때문이다. 그 결과 그녀들은 규칙적인 단계를 거쳐 최종적으로는 거의 맹목적이고도 노발 대발한 상태가 되었던  것이다.\\n\\u3000“나를 지켜주겠다고 맹세한 내 남편 앞에서 지금 저 인간이 내게 말 하는 폼 좀 보세. 아이고! 환장하겠네! 아이고! 아이고!”\\n\\u3000“아아아!” 올릭(악당)이 누른 이빨을 드러내며 으르렁거렸다. “저 ○이 내 마무라였다면 당장 붙잡아 펌프에 집어넣고 숨도 못 쉬게 했을 텐데.”\\n\\u3000“그녀를 내버려두라고 내가 분명 말했을 텐데.” 조가 다시 한 번 말했다.\\n\\u3000“아이고! 저 놈 말하는 것 좀 보소!” 누나가 손뼉을 한 번 친 후 말했다. 그건 하나의 비명에 가까웠다. 이제 그녀는 좀 더  높은  단계의 분노 단계로 진입한 것이다. “지금 저 놈이 나보고 뭐라고 하는지 좀 들어봐라. 저 작자가! 내 집 지붕 아래에서! 결혼한 나보고! 내 남편이 버젓이 옆에 있는 상황에서! 아이고! 아이고!”\\n\\u3000여기서 누나는 발작적인 박수들과 비명들을 질러댄 후, 두 손바닥으로 자신의 가슴과 무릎을 쳐댄 후 쓰고 있던 모자를 마당에 내던지곤 머리까지 풀어 제쳤다(풀어 내렸다). 결국 누나는 마지막 분노 단계인 광란의 질주 단계에 막 진입한 것이다.\\n\\u3000이때까지 광란의 분노 단계에 막 진입하는 데 완전히 성공한 누나가 대장간 문 쪽으로  돌진했다.\\n다행히도 문은 안에서부터 잠겨있었다. \\n\\u3000이들 사이에 끼어들어 올릭(악당)의 입을 다물게 하려다 무시당한 비참한 꼴이 된 조(주인공의 매형)가 도대체 이 상황에서 어떤 다른 선택을 할 수  있었겠는가?\\n\\u3000이제 자신의 부하 직원 앞에 당당히 버티고 선 채 올릭에게 이렇게 요구했다. “나와 내 아내 사이에 그런 식으로  끼어들다니  무슨 의도 지?” 더 나아가 조는 올릭이 자신에게 당당히 덤빌 수 있는 사내인지 아닌지를 물었고, 상황이 이쯤 되니 자칭 늙어빠진 올릭(25세, 괴력의 소유자, 악당, 대장간 장인)도 이 싸움에 응하는 수밖에 없다고 느끼는  듯 했다. 그 즉시 올릭이 방어 자세를 취했다.\\n\\u3000불에 그슬리고 탄  작업용 앞치마들을 벗고 말고 할 겨를도 없었다. 두 거인은 그렇게 서로에게  달려들었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 누구도 조(주인공의 매형)의 공격을 오래 견뎌낼 수 없었다. 나는 이전에도 이후에도 조의 공격을 한 동안 버터낼 수 있는 이웃을 본  적이 없었다.\\n\\u3000올릭은, 마치 창백한 어린 신사(주인공의 한 방에 나가떨어졌던 도련 님)처럼 석탄 더비 사이로 나가 떨어졌다. 그러더니 거기에서 나오려고 서두르지 않았다.\\n\\u3000올릭에게 더 이상 싸울 의지가 없음을 확인한 조가 대장간 문을 열고 안뜰로 나갔다. 조가 내 누나(조의 아내)를 안아 들었다. 누나는 감 각을 잃고 창가 아래에 쓰러져 있었다. 내 생각에 누나도 조와 올릭의 결투를 지켜보았을 것  같았다.\\n\\u3000조가 그녀를 집 안(주인공의 집은, 대장간과 가정집이 따로 임)을 옮긴 후 그녀를 자리에 눕혔다. 조가 그녀에게 깊이 숨을 들어마셔 보  라고 말했다.\\n\\u3000내 누나는 두 손으로 조의 머리카락을 꽉 쥐고서 버둥거리려 할 뿐 이었다.\\n\\u3000그러더니 모든 소동 뒤에는 늘 따라오기 마련인 치욕 같은 고요와 침묵이 우리들 사이에  찾아왔다.\\n\\u3000내가 바로 이런 소강상태와 항상 연결 짓곤 하던 모호한 감정이 든 것도 그때였다. 즉, ‘오늘이 일요일이지. 누군가가 죽은 거 같은 기분이 든다.’라는 모호한 감정 말이다.\\n\\u3000나는 위층 내 다락방으로 올라가 옷을  챙겨 입고 외출할 준비를 했다.\\n\\u3000내(주인공, 조의 수습공이자 처남, 12살 혹은 14살)가 다시 아래층으로 내려왔을 때, 조(주인공의 매형, 대장장이)와 올릭(악당, 25세, 조의 부하직원, 대장간에서 일하는 장인, 주인공의 누나를 해치고 주인공을 일생일대의 위험 속으로 몰아넣는 범죄자)이 빗자루 질을 하고 있었다. 올릭의 콧구멍들 중 한 쪽에 가늘고 긴 상처가 난 것 빼고는 그에게서  어떤 다른 동요의 흔적은 찾아볼 수 없었다. 일은 그렇게 마무리가 된 것이다.\\n'세  명의  쾌활한  바지선  선원들'(술집이름)에서 맥주 1000cc(천 시시\\n=1리터)가 배달되어온 것 같았다. 빗자루  질을 마친 조와 올릭이  일대 일로 그 맥주를 차례대로 나누어마셨다.\\n\\u3000맥주가 조에게 철학적인 통찰을 주었고 마음을 진정시킨 것이 분명했다. 그가 나를 배웅하러 도로까지 따라 나오며 이번 방문이 내게 좋은 결과를 가져오길 바란다며 작별인사로 이런 말을 했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“다투기도 하고, 핍(주인공 이름), 맥주를 나눠 마시기도 하고, 핍, 그런 게 인생  아니겠니.”\\n\\u3000나는 터무니없을 정도로 들뜬 마음상태로 미스 해비샴(갑부, 39세 여성)의 저택으로 향하고 있는 내 자신을 발견했다. 하지만 그것은 여기서 전혀 중요한 항목이 아닐 것이다. 왜냐하면 어른들(지금 이야기를 풀어가고 있는 주인공자신, 어른)은 아주 심각하다고 받아들이는 감정들을 아이들의 경우 익살맞다고 그저 생각하고 마는 경향이 있기 때문이다(미스 해비샴이 분명 돈 천 만원을 주며 이것으로 주인공과 자신은 쌤쌤이라고 분명 말했음에도 재차 그녀의 집을 그것도 1년 만에 다시 방문 하는 것이 보통 심각한 일이 아님에도 주인공은 에스텔라를 만날 수 있을 거라는 생각에 너무 좋아서 제정신이 아니라는 얘기).\\n\\u3000또한 내가 그 집 대문  벨을 울리기로 최종적으로 마음먹기까지, 내가 그 집 대문을 얼마나 여러 차례나 들어갔다가 다시 나오기를 무한 반복했는지는 여기서 전혀 중요하지 않는다.\\n\\u3000그리고 또한 내가 그 집 대문 벨을 울리지 말고 그냥 내 집으로 되 돌아가야하는 것은 아닌지 하고 내 자신이 얼마나 많이 제고해보았는지도 여기서 중요한 사안이 아니다.\\n\\u3000또한, 만약 내 스케줄을 내가 조정할 수 있었다면 그녀의 저택을 방문하지 말고 당장 내 집으로 되돌아갔어야 했었음이 이후 벌어진 일련의 사건들을 통해 얼마나 명백해졌는지 이 자리에서 다시 논의하는 것도  옳지 않다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 아니라, 세라 포킷(결혼하지 않은 주름투성이 노파. 소설  속 엑스트라. 독자가 이름을 알아두면 중간 중간 소설의 흐름을 이해하는데 도움이 되는 이름임) 양이 대문을 열어주러 나왔다. 에스텔라의 흔적은  어디에도 없었다.\\n\\u3000“여길 다시 찾아오다니? 그래, 어떻게 왔지?” 미스 세라 포킷 양이 말했다. “원하는 게  뭐지?”\\n\\u3000나는 단지 미스 해비샴 마님(39세)에게 인사차 들렸다고 말했다. 세라는 ‘이 애를 여기서 당장 돌려보낼지 아니면 자기 권한만으로도 이 애를 들여도 될지?’를 심각하게 고민하는 모습을 보였다.\\n\\u3000결국 자신이 책임을 지는 모험을 감수하긴 싫었던 그녀는 나를 대문 안으로는 들이데 잠깐 기다리라고 하곤 먼저 안으로 들어갔다.\\n\\u3000잠시 후 그녀가 “올라와도 좋다.”는 미스 해비샴 마님의 짤막한 메시지를  가지고 돌아왔다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴의 방은 그대로였다. 아무 것도 변한 게 없었다. 다만 이 번에는 미스 해비샴 마님 혼자만 이 방을 지키고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“그래,” 그녀가 시선을 내게로 고정시킨 채 말했다. “네가 무엇을 바 라고 왔는지는 내 모르겠다만 내게서 더 얻어갈 것은 없다는 사실을 명심해두어라.”\\n\\u3000“아니에요 마님 그게 아니에요. 저는 다만 제가 지난 1년 동안 제 수습공생활을 잘 해왔고 그 때문에 마님께 항상 감사하고 있다고 감사 인사 드리러 왔을  뿐이에요.”\\n\\u3000“됐다, 됐어!” 그녀가 또 예전처럼 자신의 손가락들을 성마르게 움직이며  말했다.  “때때로 찾아  오거라.  네(주인공) 생일날  맞추어서 와라.\\n…,  아아!”  몸과  의자를  내  쪽으로  돌리던  그녀가  갑자기  소리쳤다. “너 지금 에스텔라를 찾기 위해 둘러보고 있구나? 그렇지?” \\n\\u3000실제로 나는 그때 에스텔라를 찾기 위해 방안 여기저기를 둘러보고 있었다. 나는 말까지 더듬어가며 여쭈어야했다. “그녀가 잘 지내는지?” “해외(프랑스 파리)로 갔다.” 미스 해비샴이 말했다. “숙녀 수업을 받으러 나갔지. 손이 닿지 않는 아주 먼 곳으로 말이다. 전보다 더 예 뻐졌고 그  애를  보는 사람들은  모두  감탄한단다.  어떠니 그  애를 잃은\\n감정이?”\\n\\u3000그녀의 마지막 말에는 지금 그 말을 하는 그녀 자신의 악의에 찬 희열감이 엿보였다. 곧 그녀가 불쾌한 웃음을 터뜨렸다. 나는 이제 무슨  말을 더 어떻게 해야 될지 몰라 당황하고 말았다.\\n\\u3000그나마 양심은 있었던지 그녀가 “그만 가 봐라”라는 말을 해줌으로써  나를 놓아주었다.\\n\\u3000호두껍데기로 만들어진 것 같은 얼굴에 주름이 많고 입이 고양이 입 같이 커다란 ‘세라 포킷(노파) 양’이 내 뒤에서 대문을 걸어 잠걸 때,   나는 내 집과 내 직업(대장간 수습공)과 내 주변 모든 것들에 대해 이 전보다 훨씬 더 큰 불만족을 느끼고 있었다.\\n그 날의 방문으로 내가 얻은 것은 그게 다였다. \\n\\u3000‘내가 만약 신사라면 무엇을 사고 있을까?’를 생각해보며 암담한 심정으로 가게 쇼윈도 안을 들여다보며 시내 중심가를 따라 어슬렁거리고  있을 때였다.\\n\\u3000나는 서점에서 막 나오고 있는 웹슬 씨(연극배우를 꿈꾸는 열혈 노총각, 아직은 교회서기)를  발견했다.\\n\\u3000그의 손에는 조지 릴로(18세기 초반의 영국비극작가)가 쓴 비극적인  책 한 권이 들려 있었다. 책의 제목은 〈런던의 상인 조지 반웰의 이\\n야기 〉 (1731년)였다.(책의 내용 : 평범한 수습공이 신분상승을 꿈꾸다 나쁜 길로 들어선 결과 자신에게 은혜를 베풀던  ‘고용주와  고용주의 딸’을 버리고 나중에는 살인까지 저지르며 패가망신하더라는 이야기?????←저도 안 읽어봐서 모름. 네이버검색 ‘조지 릴로’와 ‘조지 반웰’ 참조)\\n\\u3000“지금 막 이 책에 만 2천원을 투자했지. 잘 했어. 굿. 지금 펌블추크 씨(능청맞은 잡곡상. 즉 곡물 도매상)를 만나 차 마시기로 했는데 잘  됐네! 잘 됐어! 그 무식한 자의 머릿속에 이 책의 내용을 한 글자도 빼지 않고 몽땅 쏟아 붓고 와야지. 방글방글. 흐뭇~”\\n\\u3000그때 그가 나를 발견했다. 그런데 어째 그의 눈이 밝아지는 게 나를 쳐다보는 표정이…, 하느님께서 지금 막 자신(웹슬)에게 “저 핍이라는 수습공을 네(웹슬)게 보내노니 그 애보고 너희들 앞에서 그 비극을 읽어라 시키어라.”라며 계시를 내린 것 같은 눈치였다. 이런  말도 안  되  는!\\n\\u3000그가 나를 막무가내로 붙들었다. 그러더니 자신과 함께 펌블추크 씨 응접실로  가자고 우겼다.\\n나는 가만히 생각해보았다. ‘어차피 집에 가봤자 지금 이 비참한 심정은 그대로일 테고 또 밤도 깊었고 귀갓길도 황량(쓸쓸)할 테니, 이왕 이렇게 된 것 혼자 마을로 돌아가느니 이 모임을 끝내고 웹슬 씨와 함     께 돌아가는 게  낫겠다.’\\n\\u3000그래서 나는 크게 저항하지 않고 웹슬 씨를 따라 펌블추크 씨 댁으      로  방향을 틀었다.\\n그때가 막, 거리와 가게들에 불이 커질 때쯤이었을 것이다. \\n\\u3000나는 조지 반웰(비극의 주인공)을 다룬 그 비극에 대해 아는 것이 없었다. 당연히 그 연극이 몇 시간짜리인지도 몰랐다. 하지만 확실한  것은 우리들의 모임이 그날 밤 9시 30분을 넘기고서야 간신히 끝이 났었다는 것이다.\\n\\u3000특히 책 속에서 ‘뉴게이트 감옥’(런던 서쪽에 있던 유명한 감옥, 1902년에 폐쇄됨)에 갇힌 주인공(이름이 ‘조지 반웰’)을 연기하던 웹슬 씨가 범죄를 저지르기 전의 주인공의 착함과 대비되는 이 치욕적인 경 력을 너무나도 리얼하게 재차 삼차 연기하고 싶어 했었기 때문에, 나는 웹슬 씨가 절대로 자진해서 그 다음 단계인 주인공의 교수형 장면까지 이 이야기를 더 진행시키지 않을 것임을 알았다.\\n\\u3000결국 웹슬 씨가 이런 불평을 했다. “어째, 조지 반웰(비극의 주인공) 이라는 이 한 떨기 꽃 같은 청춘은 나락으로 떨어지고야 말았단 말인가? 마치 그 자신이 수습공생활을 시작하면서 불행을 피하기 위해 갈피갈피(사이사이) 애를 쓰지 않은 것처럼.”\\n\\u3000내가 생각하기에 웹슬 씨의 이런 불평은 좀 지나친 게 아닌가 싶었다. 그건 단지 젊은 나이에 생을 마감한 주인공과 그런  주인공을 지루하게 연기한 웹슬 씨의 연기력에 관한 문제일 뿐인데 말이다.\\n\\u3000나를 쓰라리게 한 것은 따로 있었다. 그 사건 전체가 꼭 내 천진난만한 이야기인 양 들렸기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000조지 반웰(비극의 주인공)이 잘못된 길로 들어서는 부분을 웰슬 씨가 연기했을 때(고용주의 딸을 버리고 타락한 여자에게 빠졌을 때)는, 내가 주인공 대신 이들에게 사과해야할 것 같은 기분이 들었을 정도다.\\n펌블추크 씨(능청스러운 곡물상인) 또한 그게 모두 나 때문인 양 분개하며 나를 빤히 쳐다보고  있었다.\\n\\u3000웹슬 씨 또한 그 부분을 연기하며 사람들의 시선이 나에게로 집중되게 노력하고 있었다. 내가 정말 고용주의 딸을 버릴 나쁜 놈이란 말인가?\\n\\u3000나는 이제 이들의 눈에 잔인하고 눈물이 헤픈 주인공인 동시에 일고 (돌이켜 생각해봄)의 가치도 없는 패륜아(삼촌살해)인 양 비난받고 있 었다.  내가 왜?\\n\\u3000타락한 여자(비극에 나오는 여자이름, 이름이 ‘밀우드’)는 사람들 앞에서 사사건건 나를 깔아뭉개고 있었고, 그에 반해 내가 버린 고용주의 딸은 내 옷깃에 달린 단추  하나도  버리지  못해  눈물을  흘리는  100% 편집광(비정상적으로 집착하는 사람)적인 여자로 웹슬 씨는 묘 사하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000사형집행 날 아침 숨도 제대로 쉬지 못하고 헉헉거리며 쩔쩔 매던    나는 이렇게 밖에 말할 수 없었다. “딱 저네요(-_-;). 총체적 부실함. 미약하고 보잘것없는 제 성격에 잘 들여 맞는 작품이네요.”\\n나는 그렇게 교수형에  처해졌다.\\n나의 교수형과 함께 웹슬 씨가 책을 덮었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 펌블추크 씨(곡물상인)만은 여전히 쀼루퉁한(못마땅한) 표정으로 나를 째려보고 있었다. 곧 그가 고개를 흔들어 보이며 내게 말했다. “교훈으로 삼아라, 소년아, 경계하고 또 경계할 지니!”\\n\\u3000이건 뭐 그는 다 알고 있다는 눈치였다. 내가 앞으로 내 가까운 사람을 살해할 범죄를 저지를 것이 명약관약(확실)함을 말이다. 만약 내가 내 가까운 사람을 유인해 그 불쌍한 사람을 내 은인으로 만들 수만 있다면, 내가 장차 가까운 시일 내에 그 은인을 살해할 생각을 품고 있다는 사실이 마을 사람들에게 널리 알려져 있다는 양 펌블추크 씨가 고개를 흔들어 보이며 내게 이렇게 말했다. “교훈으로 삼아라, 소년아, 경계하고 또 경계할 지니!”\\n\\u3000모임이 파하고(끝나고) 웹슬 씨와 내가 집으로 향하는 길에 올랐을  때엔 사방이 이미 깜깜한 밤이었다. 읍을 벗어나자 안개가 장난이 아 니었다(자욱했다). 안개 때문에 옷이 축축해지고 무겁게 느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000유료 도로(마차 통행세를 내야하는 도로)의 램프가 흐릿하게 보일 정도였다. 보기에도 램프 위치가 평상시보다 훨씬 더 저 쪽으로 벗어나 있었다. 그렇게 보였다. 램프에서 뿜어져 나오는 광선이 안개에 갇혀 고체물질 같이 보이고  있었다.\\n\\u3000우리는 이런 것들에 주목하며 대화를 나누고  있었다.  “이  맘 때만 되면 습지대에서 부는 바람이 변한단 말이야. 그럼 이렇게 안개가 발 생하지. 이 둘 사이에 어떤 과정을 거치는 걸까?” 우리가 어떤 남성을 발견한 것이 그때였다. 유료 도로(마찻길) 요금 받는 건물 벽들 중 바람이 없는 벽에 기댄 채 몸을 앞으로 수그리고 축 처진 자세를 취하고  있는 남성이었다.\\n\\u3000“어이!” 우리가 가던 길을 멈추고 불렀다. “거기 올릭(천성적으로 사악한  악당) 아닌가?”\\n\\u3000“엇!” 그가 구부정한 자세로 우리 쪽으로 걸어오며 대답했다. “잠깐 서 있었지, 친구를 만날지도 모른다는 은근한 기대감을 가진 채 말이야.”\\n“늦었군요.”  내가 주목했다.\\n당연한 일이지만 올릭도 이렇게 대답했다. “글쎄? 너도 늦었구나.” “우리  모두  늦었도다!”  펌블추크  씨의  응접실에서  있었던 비극상연\\n으로 기분이 아주 들떠 있던 웹슬 씨(교회서기)가 의기양양하게 말했    다. “올릭 씨, 우린 지금 막 지적인 저녁을 보내고 오는 길이라오.”\\n\\u3000지적인 저녁이고 뭐고 자기는 더 할 말도 더  없다는  듯 ‘자칭 늙어  빠진  올릭(악당)’이 으르렁거렸다(말했다).\\n우리 셋은 그렇게 귀갓길의 동행이 되었다.\\n\\u3000내가 곧 올릭에게 이렇게 물었다. “반나절의 휴가 어디서 보냈어요. 읍내? 아님 부자동네에서(읍 외곽)?”\\n\\u3000“그래.” 올릭이 말했다. “둘 다다. 네 놈이 읍내로 들어가고 바로 바로 들어갔으니까. 나는 네 놈을 못 봤다지만 어쨌든 네 놈 뒤에 있었을 거다. 그건 그렇고, 뭔 놈의 대포소리가 이렇게 많이 들리는 거야.”\\n“감옥선(배)에서 나는 소리 아녜요?” 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“아아! 그 놈의 새장에서 나는 소리였군. 그렇담 몇 마리가 튄 모양 이군. 거무스름할 때부터 쏘아댔으니 벌써 날랐겠군. 이제 또 한 방 쏠 거다.”\\n\\u3000실제로도 우리가 몇 미터 못 가서 대포 소리가 들렸다. “붕”하고 울리는 아주 익숙한 소리였다. 우리 쪽 방향으로 발사된 것 같았다. 안개가 그것을 가로막아 대포소리는 실제보다 훨씬 약하게 들렸지만 내가 익히 기억하고 있는 소리였다. 그러고 보니 마치 도망자를 뒤쫓기라도 하려는 것처럼 마치 도망자를 위협이라도 하려는 것처럼 대포소리들은 강가 낮은 언덕을 따라 무겁게 굴러가고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“튀기에 좋은 밤이지. 역시 도망가기에 이런 밤도 없지.” 올릭이 말했다. “녀석들 골치 좀 아프겠는걸. 튄 놈들이야 나르면 그만이지만 간수 들이야 다시 잡아들 이려며 말이야. 어쨌든 일 났군. 오늘 밤 고생  좀  해라, 이것들아.”\\n\\u3000이 주제(탈옥수)는 나에게 연상시키는 것이 하나 있었다. 나는 조용히 그것(탈옥수)에 대해 생각에 잠겨갔다.\\n\\u3000웹슬 씨는 자신이 아까 연기했던 비극 속 삼촌, 주인공에게 은혜를 베풀었건만 주인공에게 살해당한 삼촌으로 빙의(혼이 옮겨 붙음)되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000웹슬 씨는 캠버웰(‘남쪽’에서 ‘런던’으로 들어가는 도로의 중간점. 즉 마차 통행세 내야하는 지점)에 위치한 정원에서 지금 죽음과 같은 명상에 잠겨 큰 소리로 마구 떠들어 대고 있었다. 명상과 떠드는 소리가 공존할 수 있다면  말이다.\\n\\u3000두 손을 호주머니에 집어넣은 채 올릭은 내 옆에서 구부정한 자세로 무겁게  걷고 있었다.\\n\\u3000아주 어두운 밤이었고, 안개로 뒤덮여 아주 축축한 밤이었다. 아주 진흙투성이 밤이었으며 온통 안개뿐인 그야 말로 보이는 모든 것이 흐 리멍덩해지는 밤이었다.\\n그렇게 우리 세 사람은 잘박잘박(질퍽질퍽) 걷고 있었다.\\n\\u3000도망자가 있었음을 알리는 대포소리가 우리들 위로 갑자기 나타났다가 심술스럽게도 강을 따라 굴러가곤 했다.  (위에 바다가 있고, 바다  위에 감옥 선이 있고, 화면중앙의 위에서 화면중앙의 아래로 강이 길게 있고. 세 사람은 화면 아래로 걸어가고 있음)\\n나는 마음속에 떠오르는 여러 가지 생각들을 하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000웹슬 씨는 캠버웰(런던남부)에서 온화하게 죽어가고 있었고, 보즈워스 필드(‘장미전쟁’이라는 영국내전 당시 리처드 3세라는 왕이 죽임을 당한 곳)에서는 사냥개들에게 미친 듯이 뒤쫓기고 있었으며, 글래스턴 베리(영국남서부의  도시,  영국최초로  그리스도교가  전파된  곳, 십자가에 못 박히신 그리스도의 피를 넣었다는 잔이 있었다고 하는 도시)에서는 극심한 고뇌로 몸부림 치고 있었다.\\n올릭도 가끔 으르렁거리며  노래했다.\\n\\u3000“두들기고 패고, 두들기고 패고, 오 성스러운 우리의 클레멘트 주교님! 때리는 소리 좋고 울리는 소리 더 좋네, 오 성스러운 클레멘트 주교님!” (클레멘트 주교 : 기원후 1세기에 프랑스 북동부 도시 ‘메츠’로 제자  2명과  함께 파견된 성스러운 가톨릭주교. 당시 메츠에서 아이들을 잡아먹던 용과 악당들을 격퇴했다는 전설이 있음)\\n\\u3000내 생각에 올릭이 술을 많이 마신 것 같았다. 하지만 취해있지는 않았다.\\n\\u3000이렇게 하여 우리는 마을에 다다를 수 있었다. 우리는 마을로  진입하는 방법으로 우리의 단골술집인 '세 명의 쾌활한 바지선 선원들'(술집이름) 옆을 지나가는 길을 택했는데 놀랍게도 시각이 밤 11시였음에도 술집 문이 활짝 열려 있는 게 분명 큰 동요가 있어 보였다.\\n\\u3000익숙지 않은(평소엔 볼 수 없는)

그가 쉬지 않고 말했다. “어서 너희 집으로 가자,   어서  핍. 달려!”\\n\\u3000“무슨 일인데요?” 내가  그를  따라잡으며  말했다. 물론 올릭(악당)도 내 옆에서 뛰고  있었다.\\n\\u3000“아, 어떻게 이런 일이, 아. ‘조 가저리’(주인공의 매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물)가 외출한 사이 너희 집에 강도가 들은 것 같다더구나. 내 생각엔 오늘 저녁에 도망갔다는 죄수가 아닐까 싶다. 너희 집에 있던 누군가가 공격을 받았는데 다쳤다는구나.”\\n\\u3000우리들은 빨리 뛰었다. 더 이상의 대화는 없었다. 부엌에 도착해서야 우리의 걸음을 멈추었고, 부엌 앞에는 이미 많은 사람들이 모여 있었다. 마을 사람 모두가 와 있었고 부엌으로 들어가지 못한 사람들은 안 뜰에 있었다. 외과 의사도 부엌 안에 있었다. 조도 있었고, 한 무리의 여성들도 와 있었다. 이들(마을 사람들, 의사, 조, 여성들)은 우리 집   부엌 한 복판의 바닥 위에서 토의 중이었다.\\n\\u3000이 토의 현장에 참여하는 것을 거부당한 구경꾼들이 나를 발견하자  길을 내주었다.\\n\\u3000그제야 나는 피해자가 내 누나인 것을 발견했다. 누나는 뒤통수에 무시무시한 가격을 당해 쓰러져 있었다. 그녀가 쓰러진 판자더미들 위 에서, 누나는 어떠한 감각도 없이 어떠한 움직임도 보이지 않았다. 살아는 있데 사지가 마비된  것이다.\\n\\u3000사건은 누나가 벽난로 쪽으로 고개를 돌렸을 때 발생했다. 누군가의 손이 그녀의 뒷머리를 가격한  것이다.\\n\\u3000나는 그제야 알게 되었다. 누나가 실은, 조(누나의 남편)의 아내인 동안에는 더 이상 사납게 화를 낼 수 없는 운명이었다는 것을….\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 16장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000내 머릿속에서는 ‘조지 반웰’(비극의 주인공, 직업이 주인공과 같은 수습공)에 대한 생각들로 가득했다. 누나가 이렇게 된 것에는 나도 일 정부분 역할을 했었음이 분명했다. 이런 생각들을 떨쳐버릴 수 없었다. 나는 이 경우 가장 유력한 용의자였다. 어떤 경우에라도 그랬다. 그녀에게 은혜를 입어온 것으로 익히 알려진 내가, 누나의 가장 가까운 혈족(남동생)인 내가, 이 사건의 용의자로 의심받는 것은 내 머릿속에\\n서 점점 더 당연시되어 갔다.\\n\\u3000하지만 밤이 지나고 다음날 아침 날이 점점 더 밝아왔을 때 나는 이 사건에 대해 뭔가 다른 시각을 가지게 되었다. 이 사건에는 뭔가가 있었다. 그리고 그런 생각은 내가 주변사람들과 얘기를 나눠보면서 확신으로 변해갔다.\\n\\u3000조(누나의 남편)는 당시 '세 명의 쾌활한 바지선 선원들'(술집이름)에 가서 담배파이프를 물고 있었었다. 그가 그곳에 머물었던 시각이, 저녁 8시 15분부터 9시  45분까지였다.  그가  그곳(술집)에  앉아있는  동안, 내 누나는 우리 집 부엌 문지방에 앉아 있었고, 농장 일꾼이 그녀를 발견하곤 서로 저녁인사를  주고받았다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그 농장 일꾼은 그 시간이 저녁 9시 전인 것 같다는 것밖에는 그게 언제였는지 기억하지 못하고 있었다. 그가 시간을 기억하려고 애를 쓰자 그는 더 깊은 혼란에 빠져들었다.\\n\\u3000조가 집에 도착한 시각은 저녁 9시 55분이었다. 그 후 바닥에 쓰려져 있는 누나(조의 아내)를 조가 발견했고 그는 즉시 이웃들에게 달려가  도움을 청했다.\\n\\u3000벽난로의 불씨가 아직 남아 있을 때였고 부엌에 있던 양초의 심지가 타서  까맣게 된  부분이  아직  길지 않을 때였다.  하지만  양초의 불만은 무언가에 의해 꺼져 있었었다. \\n\\u3000집 안 어디에도 사라진 물건은 없었다. 부엌문과 누나 사이에는 식탁이 하나 있었다. 그 위에 촛불이 하나 있었다. 그게 다였다. 누나는 벽난로를 바라보고 서 있을 때 뒤에서 머리와 등뼈를 가격 당했던 것이다. 누나는 쓰러지며 피를 흘렸고 그 외에는 부엌 어디에도 어질러진  흔적은 없었다.\\n\\u3000하지만, 부엌에 한 가지 범상치 않은(주목할 만한) 증거물이 발견되었다. 그건 오래된 족쇄(다리에 차는 쇠사슬)였다.\\n\\u3000누나는 무언가 뭉툭(뭉툭한 것으로 맞으며 타격이 강함)하고 묵직한 것에 의해 머리와 등뼈에 가격을 당했고 그 수차례의 타격이 마무리된 후 쓰러진 그녀 위로 또 무언가 묵직한 물건이 상당히 강한 힘으로 내던져졌다. 그때 그녀는 이미 얼굴을 부엌바닥으로 향한 채 사지가 마비된 직후였다.\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물)가 그녀를 들어 올 리려고 할 때였다. 그녀 옆에서 족쇄(다리에 차는 쇠사슬) 하나가 발견 되었다. 그것은 줄(쇠를 자르는 대장간도구)에 의해 산산이 조각난,  어느 죄수의 족쇄임이  분명했다.\\n\\u3000곧 조(대장장이)는 장인(기술자)의 눈으로  그  쇠를  조사하기 시작했고 이내 “이 족쇄는 상당히 오래전에 잘린 게 분명해”라는 선언을 했다. 그의 말이 원인이 되어 감옥선(배)에서 전문가들이 왔다. 그들은 죄수를 추격하던 사람들이었다. 그들이 조의 의견을 확증해주었다.\\n“틀림없습니다. 이  족쇄(쇠사슬)는  우리  배에  있었던  것입니다.” 하지만 그들은 그게 언제 감옥선을 떠났는지에 대해서는 책임 있는\\n답변을 하려 들지 않았다. 다만 그들은 이렇게 말했다.\\n“확실한데…. 이건 어제 탈옥한 놈들이 차고 있던 수갑이 아닌데.”\\n더 나아가 그들은 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“어젯밤 탈옥한 죄수 두 놈은 즉시 체포되었으며 그들은 체포 당시 족쇄를 풀지 못한  상태였습니다.”라고.\\n\\u3000내가 이미 알고 있는 것이 있었기 때문에 이 지점에서 새로운 추론 (결론)을 구성해보겠다.\\n\\u3000범행에 사용된 쇳조각은 분명 내가 1년 전 빵을 건네준 죄수가 늪지 대에 버리고 간 족쇄가 분명했다. 나는 분명 그가 차고 있던 그 족쇄를 보았었고 내가 도망치는 동안 그가  늪지대에  앉아서 갖은 욕설과 함께 줄(대장간도구)을 가지고 족쇄를 자르는 것을 보았었기 때문이다. 하지만 아무리 생각해도 그가 내 누나를 쓰러뜨린 범인 같지는 않았 다. 차라리 그의 손을 떠났던 쇳조각이 다른 한 두 사람들의 손에 들\\n어갔다가 여기에 등장했음이  분명했다.\\n\\u3000올릭(악당, 범인)이 몰래 가지고 있었을 수도 있다. 혹은 나에게 내가 죄수에게 건넸던 줄(대장간도구)을 다시 보여주었던 낮선 남성(술집에서 매형의 술값을 낸 남성)이 소유했을 수도 있었다.\\n\\u3000그래 올릭에 대해 말해보자. 그는 분명 읍내에 갔었다. 적어도 우리 (주인공과 웹슬 씨)가 돌아오는 길에 ‘마차통행료 내는 곳’에서 그를 만났기 때문이다. 그는 저녁 내내 읍내 여기저기에 모습을 드러냈었고 몇 군데의 술집에서는 서로 다른 일행들과 술자리를 가졌음이 밝혀졌다. 그리고 밤이 되자 나와 웹슬 씨(교회서기)와 함께 우리 마을로 다시  돌아온 것이다.\\n\\u3000누나와 말다툼을 한 것을 제외하곤, 그를 의심한 증거는 어디에도 없었다. 사실 내 누나가 그와 말다툼을 한 것은 이번 한 번  만도 아니었다. 수천 번은 더 되었을 것이다. 누나는 또한 그녀 주변의 사람들은 물론 모르는 사람들과도 수천 번은 더 말다툼을 해오며 살아왔다.\\n\\u3000이제부터는 내가 술집에서 만났던 낮선 남성에 대해 생각해보겠다.  만약 그 사나이가 술집에서 잘못 주었던 ‘50만 원짜리 수표 2장’을 되찾아가기 위해 우리 집에 들렀다가 범행을 저지르고 달아난 경우라면, 이건 말도 안 되었다.  누나는  분명  그 돈을 돌려주려고  철저하게 준비 를 하고 있었기 때문이다. 낮선 남성이 자신의 수표를 돌려받기 위해 왔더라면 누나는 분명 돌려주었을  것이다.\\n\\u3000게다가 사건 현장(부엌)에는 어떠한 언쟁의 흔적도 없었다. 공격자는 아주 은밀하게 그리고 순식간에 부엌 안으로 들어와, 누나가 채 낮선 방문자를 알아보기도 전에, 고개를 돌리기도 전에 누나의 뒷머리를 사 정없이 가격하고 달아났기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000내가 범죄의 도구를 제공했다는 생각에 몸서리가 쳐졌다. 고의는 아니었다. 그럼에도 그런 생각을 떨쳐버릴 수가 없었다.\\n\\u3000결국 내 어린 시절의 주술을 끊어버리고 내가 조(매형)에게 이 모든 사실들을 얘기해주어야 할지 말아야 할지 생각해보고  또  생각해보는 동안 나는 이루 말로 표현할 수 없는 고통을 겪어야했다.\\n\\u3000사건 발생 후 수개월동안, 나는 매일 그 문제에 대해 생각해보았고 결국 매번 “노”라는 답을 도출하고 말았다. 그럼 다음 날 아침 다시 그 문제들이 내 마음 한 구석에서 솟아올랐고, 그럼 또 나는  내 스스로가 설정해놓은 양심 속으로 떨어질 수밖에 없었다. 결국 이런 식의 논쟁이 내 안에서 계속되었고 나는 다음과 같은 결론을 내었다.\\n\\u3000“그 비밀(1년 전 탈옥수에게 빵과 줄을 가져다주었다)은 이제 너무 오래전일이며 내 안에서 너무 커져버렸기 때문에 나는 그것을 억지로 떼어낼 수 없다(폭로할 수 없다). 이젠 내 양심의 일부분이기 때문이다.”\\n\\u3000“게다가 더 치명적인 것은” 무심코 저지른 내 작은 선행이 이젠  너무 심한 나쁜 짓이 되고 말았기 때문에, 만약 조가 사실을 모두 알게 된다면 나와 그와의 사이는 이전보다 훨씬 더 소원해질(멀어질) 것이 “명약관화하다는 사실이었다.”\\n\\u3000나는 또한 조가 내 말을 믿지 않으려들 것이라는 근심보다 더 큰 불안에 시달리고 있었는데, 다름 아니라 내가 고백하더라도 그가 또 내가 예전에 그에게 했었던 거짓말 “엄청난 크기의 검은 개들과 그 거친 개들이 ‘저민 송아지 고기’들을 서로 차지하기 위해 싸우더라.”처럼 이 번에도 내가 쇳조각 이야기를 지어냈으며 이건 그냥 또 하나의 추하고 괴이한 아이의 망상에 불과하다고 치부해버릴지 모른다는 불안이었다.(←제가 옮겼지만 정말이지... ‘콩글리쉬의 끝’을 보는 것 같음. -_-;; 그래도 큰 줄거리나  문맥은 비슷하다는 것에 의미를 두고 있음. 그나마 다행~)\\n\\u3000물론 나는 내 자신과 우물쭈물 타협했음을 이  자리에서 밝힌다. 이래야 될지 저래야 될지 몰라 방황하던 내가 도대체 어떤 결론을 내릴 수 있었겠는가?\\n\\u3000내 결론은 다음과 같았다. “만약 가해자를 찾는 데 도움이 될 새로운 증거나, 혹은 그런 유의 기회를 내가 발견했을 때 그때 가서 모든 것을 고백하자.” 나는 내 자신에게 이렇게 굳게 결심하는 선에서 내 추론을  마무리 지어야했다.\\n\\u3000“런던의 범죄자 체포 담당 경관들(형사들)과 순경들”이 일주일 혹은 이주일 동안 우리 집 주변을 수색하며 정부당국이 이러한 경우에 항상 범한다고 하는 온갖 것들을 다했다.\\n\\u3000그들은 누가 봐도 이 사건과 전혀 상관없는 인물들을 긴급히 체포하는가 하면, 명백히 잘못된 자신들의 고정관념에 사로잡혀 자신들의 머리를 쥐어짜는가 하면, 상황증거를 가지고 합리적인 추론을 시작하는 것이 아니라 잘못된 자신들의 추론을 가지고 상황을 짜집기해 나가곤 했다.\\n\\u3000또한 마을 술집 문 앞에 버티고 선 채 뭔가를 다 아는 듯 한 표정을 짓거나 내성적인 표정을 짓곤 했는데, 그 표정들이 얼마나 리얼했는지 마을사람들 모두가 마음 깊이 감동했을 정도였다.\\n\\u3000또한 그 형사들과 순경들은 술집에서 술을 마실 때에도 꼭 범인을 당장 체포하려는 듯 비밀스런 태도를 취하며 마시곤 했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그 뿐이었다. 실제 그들은 이 사건에 아무런 도움이 되지 못했기 때문이다.(←18세기 초 영국 런던 ‘보(거리이름) 거리’를 담당하던 체포조 경관들을 말한다고 함. 디킨스가 『 위대한 유산 』 을 쓰기 22년 전에 해산되었음. 위키백과  참조)\\n\\u3000이 합법적인 권한을 가진 사람들이 마을에서 모두 물러가고도 한 참 동안을 내 누나는 사경을 헤매며 침대에 누워있어야 했다.\\n\\u3000이후에도 그녀의 시선은  혼란스러웠고 복시로 고생했다. 사물이  여러 개로 보였기 때문에 그녀가 찻잔이나 포도주 잔을 집으려고 하면 실제 찻잔이나 포도주 잔이 아니라 허구의 찻잔이나 포도주 잔을 붙잡 혔다.(“뒷통수-후두엽” 부분이

만큼 누나가 다시 의식을 차렸을 때에도, 내 석판(분필로 글을 쓸 수 있는 돌)을 그녀 가까이 항상 놓아두어야했다. 그녀가 말로는 가리킬 수 없는 것을 글로는 표현할 수도 있었기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000누나의 글씨체는 썩 좋지 않았다. 악필 수준이었다. 게다가 남편인 ‘조’도 썩 좋지 않은 글 읽는 사람이었기 때문에, 기이하고 복잡한 상 황들이 그들 부부 사이에 자주 발생하곤 했다. 그럴 때면 내가 항상  불려가 해결해야했다.\\n\\u3000“약물투여”라는 말을 “양고기요리 하라”는 말로 오해하는가 하면, “조”를 부르는데 “차”를 갖다 주기도 했다. “베이컨(돼지고기)을 갖다 달라.”는 말에 “제빵업자”를 부르러 가기도 했다. 이 모두는 그나마 우리들 사이에서 오고간 수많은 실수들 중에서 그나마 가장 양호한 것들 이다. (“ ”와 “ ”는 비슷한 영어발음)\\n\\u3000하지만, 누나의 성격은 몹시 개선되어 참을성이 있었다. 그녀의 손발들이 모두 떨리고 자신이 없는 듯 한 동작들을 하는 것은 곧 그녀의 일상적인 삶의 한 부분이 되었다. 그 후로도 다시 두 달 혹은 세 달이 지났을 때였다. 누나가 종종 그녀의 두 손을 머리에 올려놓고는 하더니 한 일 주일 동안 우울하고 넋이 나간 상태가 계속되었다.\\n\\u3000이런 일이 반복되었고 그럴 때면 우리들(매형과  주인공)은  누나를 어떤 식으로 돌봐주어야 될지를 몰라  어쩔  줄을  몰라 하고 있었다.  결국 구원투수가 등장해 우리들을 구해주는 상황이 발생했다.\\n\\u3000‘웹슬 씨’(교회서기)의 대고모(‘웹슬 씨의 아버지’의 고모)가 살아생전의 고질적인 습관들을 정복하고 죽은 것이다(제 성격에 못 이겨 죽 었다는 얘기) 그 집에서 일하고 있던 비디(앞에서 설명한, 예쁘지 않지만 마음씨 고운 여자조연. 꾸미진 않지만 일요일 예배보러 갈 때는 예쁘장하게 옷을 입고 약간 화려한 복장으로 교회에 가는 여자. 대고모와 먼 친척이니 혹은 웹슬 씨와 먼 친척이니 하는 말이 있지만 고아라는 얘기도 있는 여자조연. 소설 전체 구성 상 큰 역할을 차지하지는 않음)가 우리 집의 한 구성원이 되기로 얘기가 오고간 것이다.\\n\\u3000누나가 부엌에 다시 등장한지 딱 한 달이 지났을 때, 비디는 자신의  모든 세속적인 물품들(전 재산)을 담은 자그만하고  얼룩덜룩  반점이 있는 상자 하나를 들고서 우리 집에 도착했다. 그리고 그 즉시 우리 집의 축복이 되어주었다.\\n\\u3000우선, 비디는 조에게 축복이었다. 왜냐하면 이 불쌍한 친구는  몸이  많이 아픈 아내를 계속해서 쳐다보며 슬픔에 빠져 헤어 나오질 못하고 있었기 때문이다. 그리고 그런 슬픈 생활에 익숙해져갔고 어느 날 저녁엔 아내를 조용히 바라보던 그가 푸른 두 눈을 촉촉이 젖신 채 이런 말을  내게 했다.\\n\\u3000“그래도 한땐 풍채가 대단한 여자였는데, 안 그러니  핍(주인공이름)?”\\n\\u3000비디는 우리 집에 도착하자마자 그녀가 잘 할 수 있는 가장 총명한 역할을 떠맡았다. 비디는 마치 누나를 아이 때부터 돌본 사람 같았다.\\n\\u3000그래서 조는 좀 더 차분히 자기 삶을 누릴 수 있는 그런 어떤 여유를 다시 가질 수 있었고 가끔씩 이기는 했지만 “세 명의 쾌활한 바지선 선원들”(마을술집이름)에 들러 자신에게 도움이 되는 시간을 가지  기도 했다.\\n\\u3000사실 이런 말을 하면 안 되는 줄 알지만, 사건이 발생했을 때 애초 용의선상에 오른 인물은 조(‘피해자인 누나’의 남편)였다. 경찰관들은 직업적인 관점에서 이 사건의 범인을 조라고 의심했었고 실제 비밀스럽게  조사도 이루어졌다.\\n\\u3000그리고 경찰관들은 조를  자신들이  지금까지  만나본  수많은  영혼들 중 가장 자기 마음을 숨기는 작자라고  결론짓고  말았는데,  정말이지 그들 직업의 독특한 특질다운  결론이었다.\\n\\u3000그나마 다행인 것은 당사자인 조 자신은 자신이 용의선상에 올랐었다는 사실을 모른다는 것이다.\\n\\u3000비디가 자신의 새로운 직무에서 거둔 첫 번째 성공에 대해 설명해야겠다. 그 문제는 나도 두 손 두 발 다 들었던 건데. 내가 해결해보려고 온갖 노력을 다 해보았지만 결국 포기하고 만 것이었다. 좀 더 자세히 기술하면  다음과 같다.\\n\\u3000누나는 석판(돌 종이) 위에다 분명 뭔가를 썼다. 그 글자는 분명 호기심 강한 “ㅌ”자 같이 보였다. 누나는 그 글자를 쓰고 또 썼다. 그리고는 그녀가 지금 이 글자에 각별한 바람이 있다는 것을 나타내기 위해 우리의 주의를 그 낱말로 끌기 위해 최대한 애섰다.\\n\\u3000내가 “타르(물에 탄 석유)”에서부터 “토스트”와 “튜브(물통)”에 이르 기까지 “ㅌ”자로 시작하는 우리 집 물건 모두를 누나 앞에 진열시켜놓 았지만 내 노력은 허사로 돌아가고 말았다.\\n\\u3000한참 있다가 내가 “ㅌ”자라는 글자의 발음(티읕)이 “망치” 두드리는 소리와 비슷하다는 것에 착안해 누나의 귀에다가 “망치!”라고 있는 힘껏 외쳤고 누나도 식탁 위를 손바닥으로 두드리며 내 의견에 조건부의 동의를 표시해주었다.\\n\\u3000그 후 곧 내가 우리 집 대장간에 있는 망치란 망치는 죄다 가져다  누나 앞에 늘어 뜨려놓았다. 하지만 내 노력은 누나로부터 아무런 호응을  얻지 못했다.\\n\\u3000그 다음으로 나는 “ㅌ(티읕)”자가 디디고 서는 목발과 비슷하다는 생각이 들어 마을에서 목발을 빌려 자신 만만하게 누나에게 보여주었지만, 누나는 목발을 보고선 도리어 누나가 움직일 수 있는 최대한도 로까지 고개를 좌우로 흔들며 “아니다”라는 표시를 했다. 그 행동은 나로 하여금 오싹하게 만들었는데, 그렇지 않아도 몸이 약해져 있는 누나가 그렇게 심하게 목을 좌우로 흔들다 혹시라도 목뼈를 삐는 것은 아닌지 걱정이 들었기 때문이다. \\n\\u3000누나(주인공과 20살차이)는 한동안 그 글자‘ㅌ’를 쓰지 않다가 비디가 자신을 이해하는 데에 재빠르다는 사실을 알자 다시 그 신비스러운 글자(ㅌ)를 석판 위에다 써보였고, 나에게서 자초지정을  들은 비디는 우선 그 글자를 사려 깊게 살펴본 후 그리고 또 누나를 사려 깊게 바라본 후 그리고 마지막으로 조(주인공의 매형)를 친절하게 바라본 후 대장간으로 뛰어갔다. 조와 나도 비디를 따라 대장간으로 건너갔다. 잠깐 딴 소리를 하자면 누나가 석판 위에다 ‘ㅈ’를 쓰면 그건 조를 불러 달라는 말이었다.\\n대장간에 들어간 비디가 기뻐서 외쳤다.\\n\\u3000“왜, 있잖아요! 그에요. 그라고요. 왜 그 생각을 못하셨어요?  어디 있지? 아 저기  있네요.”\\n\\u3000올릭(악당. 대장간 장인. 괴력의 소유자. 누나와 말싸움을 심하게 한 후 그날 저녁에 뒤에서 몰래 다가와 누나의 뒷머리를 족쇄로 강타하고 읍내로 도망갔다 돌아온 범인. 나중에 주인공의 목숨도 위협하는 인물임. 사악함)이었다. 누가 봐도  올릭이었다.\\n\\u3000누나가 ‘ㅌ’자를 쓴 것은 기억력이 감퇴해 올릭의 실제 이름을 잊어 먹었기 때문이었다. 단지 올릭이 대장간 장인이며 해머질 할 때 나는 소리만을 기억해내고 둘을 이어붙인 것이다.\\n\\u3000우리들(비디, 조, 주인공)은 그에게 자초지정을 들려주었고  우리와 함께 부엌에 가자고 말했다. 그도 엉거주춤 자신의 해머를 내려놓으며 팔뚝에 걸친 소매로 이마의 땀을 닦았다. 그 후 그가 다시 작업용 앞 치마로 이마위의 땀을 한 번 더 닦은 후 그 특유의 걸음 걷는 자세인 상체를 앞으로 푹 수그리고 축 처진 자세로 걷기 시작했다. 그는 두  무릎이 특이할 정도로까지 건들거리며 걸었는데 영락없는 깡패가 걷는 자세였다. 다만 그것을 자신의 트레이드마크(버릇)인양 생각하는 모양 이었다.\\n\\u3000여기서 밝혀두어야겠다. 누나가 올릭(범인)을 부른다는 것을 알았을   때 난 이제부터 누나가 올릭을 만천하에 고발할거라고 생각했다. 적어도 그를 비난하는 광경을 보게 될 거라고 확신했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 막상 올릭이 모습을 보이자 누나는 그와 좋은 관계로 지내고 싶다는 가장 강렬한 희망을 내비췄고, 시간이 한참 지났지만 이렇게라도 올릭이 그녀 앞에 나타나준 것에 대해 매우 기뻐하는 표정이 역력했다. 누나는 그에게 마실 것을 좀 갖다 주라는 몸짓을 취했다.\\n\\u3000누나는 올릭의 얼굴표정을 지켜보며 마치 그가 이 모든 호의를 우호 적으로 받아들이는지를 각별히 확인하고 싶어 하는 눈치였다. 누나는 그를 달래 서로간의 불신을 없애고 싶다는 뜻을 가능한 한 모든 방법을 동원해 내비췄고, 누나가 하는 그런 모든 행동에는 친해지고 위무 (달래기)하려는 태도가 역력했다. 마치 난폭한 주인에 대해 아이가 취 하는 일방적인 태도 그  자체였다.\\n\\u3000그날 이후 단 하루도 빠지지 않고 누나는 석판(돌 종이) 위에다가 ‘ㅌ’자를 그렸다. 그럼 올릭이 몸을 앞으로 수그린 축 처진 자세로 들어와 누나 앞에 끝까지 서 있었다. 마치 자기 자신도 이 사태에 대해 어떻게 처신해야 될지를 그 이상은 모르겠다는 눈치였다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 17장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000나(17세)는 지금 판에 박힌 수습공생활로 접어들고 있었다. 그것은 내 생일이 돌아오면 미스 해비샴(44세)을 방문해 용돈을 받거나 혹은 다른 일들로 그녀를 방문해 용돈을 받는 것 외엔 어떤 다른 주목할 만한 사항도 없는 따분한 생활의 연속이었다. 자연히 내 활동반경도 우리 마을과 늪지대의 경계선을 넘지 못했다.\\n\\u3000이번 방문에 있어서도 여전히 세라 포킷(결혼안 한 주름투성이 노파, 11장 #15참조, 소설 속에서 주인공의 신분이  달라질  때마다 저택의 문을 열어주는 역할을 하는 자존심 세고 거만한 엑스트라임)이 정문을 열어주는 임무를 맡고 있다는 것을 알아차렸다.\\n\\u3000나는 알았다. 내가 작년에 이 집을 떠났을 때 그 모습 그대로 미스 해비샴이 화장대에 앉아 있다는 것을. 이번 면담에서도 그녀는 에스텔 라(미스 해비샴의 양녀)의 이야기를 했다. 그 얘기는 작년에도 들었던 내용이었다. 단지 단어 몇 개가 달라졌을 뿐이다. 그녀는 그렇게 매년 똑같은 얘기를 들려주며 자신의 시간이 흐르고 있다는 사실을 망각하려는  것 같았다.\\n\\u3000우리의 면담은 몇 분을 지속하지 못했다. 내가 문안인사를 드리고 돌아가려하자 그녀가 이번에도 나에게 50만 원 짜리 수표 한 장을 주 었다(18세기  영국 돈 ‘1기니’를 물가기준으로 현재 우리나라 돈 50만 원 정도로 가정하면 소설의 앞뒤 문맥상 얘기가 편함).\\n그녀가 말했다.\\n“다음 번 네 생일날에 다시 방문하거라.”\\n\\u3000내 생일날 그녀의  집을 방문하는 것은 이제 연례행사가 되었다. 나도 처음에는 용돈을 안 받으려고 했다. 액수가 너무 컸고 이미 큰돈을 받은 상태에서 사리에도 맞지 않는 것 같았기 때문이다. 하지만 그런 내 태도에 그녀가 아주 화를 내며 “더 달라는 얘기냐?”라고 호통을 칠 것 같아서 그냥 감사해하며  받았다.\\n\\u3000이 흐릿하고 오래된 저택은 항상 불변이었다. 변화는 게 없었다. 거 무스름하게 어둠이 진 방안을 비추는 노란색 촛불들과, 자신의 화장대 거울 옆에 놓여 있는 의자에 앉은 채 빛깔이 바랜 유령의 형상을 하고  있는 미스 해비샴, 마치 시계가 멈추었을 때 이 미스터리한 장소 내에 있던 모든 시간이 멈춘 것 같은 느낌이었다. 이 집 밖에 있던 나와 그  밖의 모든 것들은  나이를 먹고  있는데, 오직 이  오래되고 흐릿한 형상 의 저택만은 영구불변인 채 이 자리 이 장소에 그대로 서 있는 것 같   았다.\\n\\u3000실제로도 집 안으로는 햇볕이 단 한 줄도 들어오지 않게 벽돌로 창문이 가려져 있었다. 그와 마찬가지로 그 저택에 있었던 일들을 생각할 때면 내 생각과 기억 속으로도 햇볕은 단 한 줄도 들어오지 못했다. 그런 생각들이 나를 당혹케 했다.\\n\\u3000그 집의 영향 아래에서 나는 진짜로 내 직업(대장장이가 될 훈련 중인 수습공)과 내 누추한 집을 부끄러워하고 있었기 때문이다. 그것도 계속해서.\\n\\u3000하지만 나(17세)는 미세하게나마 비디(여자조연, 19세 정도의 나이) 에게 어떤 외적인 변화가 일어나고 있음을  인식하게  되었다.  비디는 굽이 높은 구두를 신기 시작했고, 그녀의 머릿결은 점점 빛났으며 솜씨 좋게 뭇고 다녔다. 손도 항상 깨끗이 하고 다녔다.\\n\\u3000남자가 봤을 때 비디는 미인은 아니었다. 그냥 평범한 얼굴의 여성이었다. 절대 에스텔라와 같은 유의 여성은 될 수 없었다. 하지만 비디는 사람의 마음을 따뜻하게 할 줄 알았고 대화를 나누면 유쾌해지는 아이였으며 건강하고 보는 이로 하여금 산뜻해지게 하는 얼굴이었다. 더구나 마음씨까지 정말  고왔다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 우리 집에 들어온 지 이제 1년이 채 안되었다. 지금 내 기억 으로는 비디가 대고모(비디의 먼 친척일 수도 있었지만 비디를 많이 혹사시키며 일만 하다 아무런 유산도 안 주고 죽은 노파)의 장례식 마 무리 짓고 애도하는 분위기에서 맛 벗어났을 때인 것 같다. 적어도 그 때쯤이었던  걸로 기억한다.\\n\\u3000어느 날 저녁 나(18세)는 이렇게 생각하고 있는 내 자신을 발견했다. ‘신기하네. 그녀는 정말 사려 깊고 따뜻한 눈을 가졌어.’ 그녀의 두 눈이 아주 예쁘고 선량하다는 것을 내가 다시 한 번 발견한 것이다.\\n\\u3000이것은 파고들고 있던 책에서 내가 막 고개를 들었을 때, 무엇을 하고 있는지 조용히 바라보고 있던 비디의 눈과 마주칠 때 일어난 일이다. 나는 그때 석판에 어떤 책의 구절들을 베껴 쓰고 있었다. 그건 동시에 두 가지 방식으로 나를 업그레이드시키려는 일종의 학습전략 중 하나였다.\\n\\u3000나는 조용히 펜을 내려놓았다. 그리고 바느질감을 내려놓지는 않았지만 비디도 하던 일을  멈추었다.\\n\\u3000“비디,” 내가 말했다. “넌 어떻게 해나가니? 내가 못 따라가는 거니, 아님 네가 너무 똑똑한  거니?”\\n\\u3000“내가 뭘 잘해간다는 거니? 무슨 소린지 모르겠는데~.” 비디가 살짝 웃어  보이며 말했다.\\n\\u3000우리 집에 온지 1년 만에 비디는 우리 집(집과  대장간살림) 살림전체를 도맡아 해나가고 있었기 때문이다. 그것도 아주 훌륭하게 그 일을  하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000물론 내가 “잘해나간다”라고 말한 것은 그런 살림 얘기가 아니었다. 비록 내가 꺼낸 얘기로 그녀의 나머지 일들이 더욱 놀라운 것으로 되 었지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000“넌 어쩜 그렇게도 뭐든 잘해나가니, 비디?” 내가 말했다. “내가 배우는 모든 것들을 넌 다 알고 있잖니, 그것도 항상 내 학습 진도에 맞추어서 말이야.”\\n\\u3000사실 나는 이 당시 내 학업 성취량에 대해 약간의 허영심(헛된 자랑)을 가지기 시작할 때였다. 왜냐하면 미스 해비샴(45세)이 내 생일 날마다 주는 용돈(매년 50만원 수표 한 장씩)을  지식을 쌓는 일에 모두 쓰고 있었고, 수습공 일로 받는 내 용돈의 대부분도 그런  유의 공부에 쓰고 있었기 때문이다. 비록 지금 생각해보면 들어간 비용에 비해 얻은 것은 별로 없었던 공부였지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000“글쎄, 그 얘기라면 내가 너에게 묻는 게 더 나을 텐데.” 비디가 말했다. “넌 어떻게  해나가니?”\\n\\u3000“아니, 난 대장간 일을 마치고 밤에 돌아오면 모두가 다 볼 정도로 대놓고 공부를 해. 하지만 넌 한 번도 남들 앞에서 공부하는 모습을 보인 적이 없잖니,  비디.”\\n\\u3000“응 그럴까, 그냥 받아들이는 것일 수도 있지. 그럴 수밖엔 없으니까. 감기처럼 말이야.” 비디가 조용히 말했다. 그리고는 자신의 바느질을 계속해나갔다.\\n\\u3000나는 나무의자에 등을 기대며 생각에 잠겨 들었다.  고개를 한 쪽으로 기울인 채 바느질을 마무리 짓고 있는 비디(착하지만 평범한 외모의 여자조연, 여자주인공 아님)를 보고 있자니, 왠지 그녀가 비범한 자 질을 지닌 여성일 수도 있다는 생각이 들기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 우리 집에 온지 채 1년도 안 되었지만,  벌써 대장간 돌아가는 사정이라든가 용어들 그리고 각종 공구들의 이름들을 우리들 남 자직공들만큼 능숙하게 사용하고 있었기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000요약해 말하자면 내(대장간 수습공)가 알고 있는 모든 것들을 이때  당시 비디도 다 알고 있었다. 이론적으로만 따지자면 그녀도 이미 나만큼이나 능숙한 기술자였다. 어떤 면에선 나보다 뛰어날 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“비디, 내가 보기에 넌 자신에게 주어진 모든 기회를 최대한 활용할 줄 아는 그런 사람들 중에 한 명 같아. 단지 지금까지 너에게 그런 기회가 주어지지 못했을 뿐이야. 네가 우리 집에 온 이후로 달라진 네  자신을 봐. 예전에 비해 얼마만큼이나 발전해 있는지를!”\\n그녀가 잠시 나를  바라보았다.  그러곤  다시  바느질을  시작했다. “하지만 난 네 첫 번째 선생님이었지 않니?” 비디가 바느질을 계속\\n하며 말했다.\\n“이런!” 내가 깜짝 놀라 외쳤다. “왜 울고 있는 거니!”\\n\\u3000“내가 언제 울었다고 그러니.” 고개를 들어 웃어 보이려고 애쓰며 그녀가 말했다. “내 행동 어디가 너로 하여금 그런 생각이 들게 한 거니?”\\n\\u3000비디(여자조연이름)의 바느질 감 위로 떨어지며 반짝이던 한 방울을 눈물을 내가 보지 못했다면 도대체 내가 어떻게 그런 생각을 할 수 있 었겠는가?\\n나는 조용히 앉아 다음과 같은 생각들을 해보았다.\\n\\u3000‘웹슬 씨의 대고모가 악에 바쳐 살다 기어이 자기 성격에 빠져 죽을 때까지, 대고모 밑에서 비디가 얼마나 자신을 억누르며 살아야했을까? 물론 비디도 성실한 아이였지만 대고모는 심해도 너무 심한 고용주였을 것이며 말이 먼 친척이지 어쨌건 대고모가 고아나 다름없는 비디를 부려먹은  것이 확실하고.’\\n나는 또 생각해보았다.\\n\\u3000‘그런 무의미한 환경들  아래에서  비디가  과연  어떤  희망을  품으며 살 수 있었을까? 끔찍하게 작은 가게(잡화점)에서 물건을 팔고 저녁이면 학교에서 아이들의 뒤치다꺼리를 도맡아야했을 텐데. 비디가 과연 무슨 희망이 있었겠는가? 대고모는 몸도 제대로 움직이지도 못하는 부실함 덩어리였고 비디는 그런 나이 많고 성격 이상한 대고모를 항상 질질 끌고 다녀야했을 테고 어깨에 메고다녀야 했을 텐데.’\\n나는 곰곰이 또  생각해보았다.\\n\\u3000‘그런 온당치 않은 시간 그런 비뚤어진 시간에도 분명 비디 내면엔 지금과 같은 자기발전에의 원동력이 있었다. 왜냐하면 내가 에스텔라 때문에 가슴 아프고 내 주변 모든 것들에 불만을 품고 힘들어했을 때   내가 가장 먼저 도움을 청하러 간 곳이 다른 사람도 아닌 비디였기 때 문이야.’\\n\\u3000나는 이런 생각들을 하며 그녀를 조용히 바라보고 있었다. 비디의 눈에는 더  이상의  눈물은 보이지 않았다.  그녀는  다만  조용히  앉아 바느질을  계속하고 있었다.\\n그때 문득 이런 생각이  들었다.\\n\\u3000‘내가 혹시 그동안 내가 정말 고마워하고 있다는 말을 그녀에게  충분히 다 하지 못했던 것은 아닐까? 내가 너무 내 자신만 챙겨 고맙다는 말을 제대로 표시하지 못하는 아이가 아니었을까? 그렇다면 적어도 지금 이 자리에서 생색이라도 내야하는 것은 아닐까?’\\n\\u3000갑자기 그 정도의 인사는 나도 할 수 있을 거라는 자신감이 들었다.  비록 이 모든 생각들이 내 머릿속에서 방실방실 웃으며 정확한 언어로 떠오른 것은 아니었지만  말이다.\\n\\u3000“있잖아, 비디(여자이름).” 고맙다는 말을 하기로 최종 결심한 내가 말했다. “넌 내 첫 번째 선생님이었어. 그땐 우리가  이렇게  함께 우리 집 부엌에 앉아 대화를 나눌 거라곤 꿈에도 생각하지 못했는데.”\\n\\u3000“아, 가엾어라!” 비디가 누나를 보며 대답했다. 자신을 완전히 잊을 정도로까지 헌신적인 모습이 그녀다웠다. 비디가 일어나 내 누나(아픈 상태)에게 다가가 부지런히 움직인 후 누나를 좀 더 편안하게 해준 후 말했다. “그건 슬픈  사실이야!”\\n\\u3000“자!” 내가 말했다. “우린 좀 더 자주 대화를 나눠야해, 예전엔 그랬던 것처럼 말이야. 그리고 난 예전처럼 너에게 더 자주 내 문제를 상의해야하고. 다음 일요일 어떠니, 우리 늪지대에 잠시 다녀오자. 산책도 하고 얘기도 더 많이 나누고 응? 비디(여자이름).”\\n\\u3000내 누나(40대, 주인공과 20살차이) 이제 누군가의 도움 없이는 혼자 있을 수 없을 정도로 건강이 악화되어있었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 조(착하지만 많이 어리숙한 매형)는 그 날 자신이 누나를 돌보는 일을 맡아주겠다고 기꺼이 말해주었다. 그래서 비디와 난 일요일 오후에 함께 산책을 나갈 수 있었다.\\n벌써 여름이었다. 날씨도 사랑스러울 정도로 화창했다.\\n\\u3000우리는 마을을 지나 교회를 지나 교회 부속의 묘지를 통과해 늪지대까지 걸어갔다. 어느 정도 더 걸어가자  해안가  앞바다에서  항해하고 있는 배들과 돛들이 보이기  시작했다.\\n\\u3000나는 “눈에 보이는 그러한 풍경들”(해안가 앞바다, 배들, 돛들, 구름, 바다와 하늘)을 “미스 해비샴과 에스텔라의 모습”과 내 방식대로 한장 한장  오버랩 시켜보았다.\\n\\u3000우린 그렇게 강가에 도착한 후 둑 위에 나란히 앉았다. 강가의 물이  내 두 발 위에서  잔물결을 일으키고  있었다. 그  잔물결이 일으키는  소리 때문인지 주변이 더 조용한 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000‘내 마음 속에 있는 신뢰감을 내보이기에 지금이 좋은 기회다.’라고  내가 결심을 굳힌 것도 바로 그때였다.\\n\\u3000“있잖아,” 그녀에게서 비밀을 지켜줄 것을 약속받은 후 내가 말했다. “비디, 난 신사가 되고 싶어.”\\n\\u3000“오,  내가  너라면 그런 말은 안  할  거야!” 그녀가 대꾸했다. “그게   네 문제에 대한 올바른 해답일 수도 없어.”\\n\\u3000“비디,” 내가 다소 격해져서 말했다. “신사가 되려는 합당한 이유가 내게도 하나쯤은 있을 거라곤 생각 못하는 거니?”\\n\\u3000“네가 더 잘 알잖니, 핍(남자주인공이름, 18세). 지금 이대로가 너에겐 더 행복할 수 있어. 안 그러니?”\\n\\u3000“비디,” 내가 참지 못하고 소리쳤다. “지금 내 모습이 더 행복할 수 있다고? 이게 뭐가? 대장장이의 수습공이라는 이 직업이? 우리 집이? 이런 내 인생이? 난 이딴 것들로부터 단 한 번도 벗어난 적이 없었어. 이보다 더 불합리한 것이 어디 있단 말이니. 그런 바보 같은  얘기 일  랑은 하지 말았으면  좋겠어.”\\n\\u3000“내 말이 바보 같다고?” 비디가 조용히 눈썹을 치켜 올리다 말고 말했다. “네가 그렇게 말하니 미안해. 난 그런 뜻으로 한 말이 아니었어. 단지 네가 잘 되었으면 그래서 좀 더 편안히 지냈음 하는 바람에서 한 말이었어.”\\n\\u3000“아니, 아니, 그렇게 되지 않을 거야, 지금 이 지겨운 내 삶과 전혀 다른 종류의 삶(신사)을 살지 못할 바에야 내 인생에서 단 한 줄기의 안락도 없을 거니까. 자 이제 알아듣겠니?, 비디. 난 이후 내 삶에서 단 한 차례도 행복해지지 못할 거라고.”\\n“불쌍한 아이!” 슬픈 듯 고개를 흔들던 비디가 말했다. \\n\\u3000지금까지 내(18세) 자신이 너무나도 불쌍한 아이라고 너무나도 자주 생각해왔었기 때문에, 비디(여자이름)가 그런 식으로 평가를 내려주자 하마터면 응응 소리를 내며 울며불며 신경질을 내고 내 머리카락들을  마구 쥐어뜯을 뻔 했다. 지금까지 내 내면에서 떠나지 않고  나를 괴롭 히던 내 다섯 살 난 자아가 이렇게 커져 나를 비뚤어지게 했는지도 모 른다.\\n\\u3000내가 비디에게 말했다. “네 말이  맞을  거야.  나도 이런 얘기를 하는  내 자신이 후회스러워. 하지만 지금 내 삶에는 희망이 없어.”\\n\\u3000“내가 내 마음을 진정시킬 수만 있었었다면….” 내가 손에 닿는 거리에 있는 풀들을 뽑으며 비디에게 말했다. 그건 에스텔라에게서 멸시를 받은 후 맥주공장 담벼락에서 내 머리카락들을 쥐어뜯으며 발로 담벼락을 수차례 발길질하던 그때의 내 격한 감정과 많이 닮아 있었다.\\n내가 비디에게 계속  말했다.\\n\\u3000“만약 내가 내 마음을 진정시킬 수만 있었었다면, 그래서 나도 예전처럼 대장간 일을 좋아할 수 있었었다면, 적어도 어린 적의 반만큼이라도 대장간 일을 좋아할 수 있었었다면. 그럼 지금의 내게 더 다행이었을 텐데. 그럼 너와 나 그리고 조(매형)도 더할 나위 없이 행복하게 지내고 있었을  텐데. 그럼 내 수습공  기간이 끝나는 대로 조와 난 좋은 동업자가 될 수 있었을 텐데. 그렇게 되었다면 난 너와 사귈 수도 있었을 텐데. 그럼 우리 모두는 여느 다른 가족들처럼 지금 이 강둑에 앉아 이 화창한 일요일을 즐기며 대화를 나눌 수 있었을 텐데. 정말로 그렇게만 되었다면 내가 너에게 청혼(결혼)했을지도  몰라,  그렇지 않 니? 비디?”\\n\\u3000항해하고 있는 배들을 바라다보고 있던 비디가 한 숨을 내쉬며 내 질문에 대한 답 대신 이런 말을 했다.\\n“그래 나는 지나치게 꼼꼼하지는  않으니까.”\\n\\u3000그 말은 결코 나에게 호의적인 말이 아니었다. 물론 그 사실을 그녀 자신이 더 잘 알고 있었을 것이다.\\n\\u3000“그러기는커녕….” 내가 잡초를 좀 더 뽑아서 한 두 개의 잎을 입에 넣으며 말했다. “내가 이제부터 어떻게 지낼지를 좀 봐. 불만족, 불유쾌함 그것뿐이야. 앞으로의 내 삶은 그것뿐이라고. 거칠고 천한 막노동 꾼이라는 수식어가 내 삶을 규정할 거고. 그럼 난…. 물론 아무도 내겐 아직까진 그렇게 말하진  않았지만….”\\n\\u3000해안가 앞바다에서 항해하고 있던 배들을 바라다보고 있던 비디가 갑자기 고개를 돌려 내 얼굴을 들여다보았다. 좀 전에 항해하던 배를 바라볼 때보다 더 주의 깊게 나를 보았다.\\n\\u3000“그 표현은 사실도 아닐 뿐더러 대단히 공손하지 않은 표현이야.” 그녀가 시선을 다시 항해하는 배들로 돌리며 말했다.  “누가  말한 거니?”\\n\\u3000그 순간 나는 당황했다. 왜냐하면 나는 지금까지 내가 무슨 말을 하 는지도 모르면서 말을 하고 있었기 때문이다. 하지만 이제 와서 돌아갈 수는 없었다. 그래서 나는 그녀의 물음에 답해주었다. 미스 해비샴의 집에 있던 어떤 아리따운 아가씨가 있더라는 말을. 내가 지금까지 본 어떤 다른 여인들보다 더 아름답더라는 말을. 나는 지금도 그녀를 무서울 정도로까지 숭배하고 있다는 사실을. 그녀 때문에라도 나는 신사가 되고 싶다는 얘기를. 이 모든 얘기들을 나를 비디에게 들려주었다.\\n\\u3000이 정신 나간 고백을 한 후 나는 내가 지금까지 갈기갈기 찢어놓았던 풀들을 강물 속으로 던져 넣기 시작했다. 마치 나도 그 잡초들을  따라 강물 속으로 들어갈 생각이 있는 것처럼 나는 갈기갈기 찢어놓았던 풀들을 강물 속으로 던져 넣기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000“그럼 넌 그녀를 괴롭히려고 아님 그녀를  차지하려고  신사가 되고 싶은 거니?” 비디가 조용히 하지만 잠시 뜸을 들인 후 다시 물었다.\\n“나도 모르지.” 안달이 나서 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“만약 네가 신사가 되려는 이유가 그녀를 괴롭히기 위해서라면….” 비디가 계속해서 말했다. “물론 핍(주인공이름, 18세) 네가 더 잘 알 테지만, 그녀가 그런 말을 했을 때 네가 그녀의 말을 무시해버리는 것이 더 좋고 나은 방법이었을 거야. 그리고 만약 네가 그녀를 차지하기  위해 신사가 되고 싶은 거라면, 이 경우에 난… 물론 네가 더 잘 알고 있을 테지만, 과연 그녀가 네가 그녀를 가질 만큼 가치가 있는지….”\\n\\u3000그랬다. 비디가 방금 한 말들은 내가 그동안 수십 번 아니 수백 번을 더 내 자신에게 던졌던 얘기들이었다. 비디의 입을 통해 이제 이  모든 것들이 내게 더 정확히 더 명백히 다가왔다.\\n\\u3000하지만 도대체 내가 어떻게, 도대체 내가, 이 불쌍할 정도로까지 이미 마음이 망가진 이 어린 시골 젊은이가, 이 세상에서 가장 올곧고  현명한 남자들조차 매일매일 빠져드는 그 황홀한 모순 속에서 빠져나올  수 있겠는가?\\n\\u3000“네 말이 모두 맞을 지도 몰라.” 내가 비디에게 말했다. “하지만 난 그녀를 무서울 정도로까지 사랑하고 있어. 숭배하고 있다고.”\\n\\u3000이후 내가 한 행동을 간략히 말하겠다. 나는 맨 먼저 얼굴을 땅으로 향하게 엎드린 후 내 머리 한 쪽 편에 있는 머리카락들을 움켜잡고 비틀어대고 있었다. 내 정신 나간 짝사랑이 그런 식으로까지 예상에서 벗어난 행동을 남 앞에서 할 수 있다는 것을 나도 그때 처음 알았다.\\n\\u3000또한 나는 잘 알고 있었다. 내가 만약 내 머리카락들을 잡아당겨 얼굴을 몸에서 뽑아버린다면, 그래서 내 천지(바보)같은 행동들에 대한 보복으로써 내 얼굴을 저 조약돌 사이로 집어던진다 하더라도, 그것은   내 얼굴이 당연히 감내해야할 벌임을 나는 분명히 자각하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000비디는 또래들 중에서 가장 현명한 아이였다. 내가 그렇게 나오자 비디는 더 이상 논리적인 설명으로 나를 설득하려고 하지 않았다. 그녀가 한쪽 손을 내밀어 내 두 손을 잇달아 가며 잡아가며 내 머리카락들 사이에서 내 손을 놓아주었다. 비록 일을 많이 해서 거칠어진 그녀의 손이었지만 부드러웠고 내게 어떤 안락함을 주는 손이었다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 그녀는 나를 진정시키기 위해 내 어깨를 손으로 조용히 두들겨주었다. 그녀가 그렇게 한 것은 내가 얼굴을 소매에 파묻은 채 약간 울고 있었기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000정확히 말하자면 에스텔라에게 홀대당한 후 맥주공장 안뜰에서 그렇게 울었던 것처럼 지금도 그러고 있었다. 어떤 사람 때문인지도 모른다. 누구에 의해서 이용당했는지는 모른다. 다만 내 마음이 무엇인가에 의해 18세 젊은이가 감내할 수 있는 것보다 훨씬 더 가혹하게 학대를 당했다는 막연한 확신만 들 뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그때 어떤 생각을 품었는지는  이 이상 기억나지 않는다.  아니면 당시엔 아무 생각이 없었는데 지금 이글을 쓰는 도중에 이것이 내 감정이었다고  착각하고  있는지도  모른다.(←이  두  문장은 영어원문에\\n\\n\\n없는데 제가 한 번 넣어보았습니다.~_~ 말 되네~) \\n\\u3000 “그래도 난 기쁘단다.” 비디가 조용히 말했다. “뭐냐면, 네가 나를 신뢰해도 좋은 사람으로 느끼고 있다는 거야, 핍. 그리고 기쁜 게 하나   더 있어. 말하자면, 네 비밀을 내게 들려주는 것을 네가 당연시 했다는 거야, 네 비밀을 들어도 될 사람으로 나를 인정했다니. 예전에 네 첫 번째 선생님이었듯이, 아 이런! 그땐 내 자신도 배워야 할 것들이 너무 많은 철없는 꼬마 선생님이었데. 어떠니? 그때의 그 꼬마 아이가 지금 네게도 선생님이 될 수 있다면? 그 꼬마 아이가 지금 네게 필요한 것이 무엇일지 알지 않을까? 그럼 이런 공부를 하시요라며 널 도와줄 수 있을 거고. 아니구나, 지금 넌 내 지식을 넘어섰으니까. 그래 이미 네 지식이 나를 능가했으니까 익히기 어려운 수업이고 뭐고 아무 소용이  없을 거야ㅋㅋ.”\\n\\u3000그렇게 나 때문에 조용히 한 숨을 한 번 더 내쉰 후, 비디가 강둑에서 일어나며 말했다. 그녀의 목소리에 상쾌하고 기분 좋은 변화가 있었다.\\n“자 그럼 좀 더 걸어가 볼까, 아님 돌아갈래?(^^방실방실)”\\n\\u3000“비디.” 내가 자리에서 일어나며 그녀를 불렀다. 내 팔은 그녀의 목을 감싸 안고 있었고 나는 그녀의 입술에 키스를 하고 있었다. “항상  내가 너에게 모든 걸 다 말할 수 있게 도와줘.”\\n“하지만 네가 신사가 될 때까지 만이야~*^^*” 비디가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“내가  그럴 수 없다는 걸  네가 더 잘  알잖아, 앞으로도 내가 신사가  될 일은 없을 거야. 내가 너에게 말을 걸 수 있는 기회도 늘 있는 것도 아니고, 어차피 이젠 내 비밀을 너도 다 알게 되었으니까. 며칠 전 밤에 부엌에서 내가 죄다 밝혔듯이 말이야.”\\n“아하 그거~!” 비디가 가볍게 속삭이며 말했다. 그녀의 시선은 이제 먼 앞바다에서 항해하고 있는 배들을 향하고 있었다. 그때 또 다시 앞서처럼 그녀의 기분이 좋아진 것을 느낄 수 있었다. 그녀가 상쾌하게 이렇게  말했기 때문이다.\\n“어떠니, 더 걸어 가볼래 아님 집으로 돌아갈까?” \\n내가 비디에게 말했다. “좀 더 걸어도 될 꺼야.”\\n\\u3000그렇게 우리는 좀  더 걸었다. 그 사이  오후의 여름은 색을 잃고 어느덧 여름의 저녁으로 변하고 있었다. 아름다운 여름저녁이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 진지하게 생각해보았다. 시계가 멈춰 있고 모든 것이 정지당한채 조명 모두를 촛불에만 의지한 채 흔들거리고 있는 방안에서 “서로 먼저 거지 만들기 카드게임”을 하며 에스텔라에게서 경멸을 받는 것보다, 지금 이렇게 신선한 바닷바람을 맞으며 여름날의  저녁을  즐기는 것이 내게 더 자연스럽고 건강에 좋은 환경이 아닐는지 진지하게 생각 해보았다.\\n\\u3000나는 또 이런 생각도 해보았다. ‘만약 내 마음 속에서 그녀에 대한 기억부분만 지울 수 있다면, 아니 그와 관련된 모든 추억들과 상상의 결과물들을 도려낼 수만 있다면 내게 지금보다 더 좋지 않을는지. 그렇다면 나는 다시 수습공 일에 즐거움을 느끼고 대장간으로 출근해 즐겁게 땀을 흘리고 있을 텐데.’라고.\\n나는 스스로에게 다음과 같은 질문을 해보았다.\\n\\u3000‘만약 비디 대신에 에스텔라가 지금 내 옆자리에 서 있다면, 에스텔라가 나를 비참하게 만들 것이 분명하지 않느냐고. 그걸 어느 누구보다도 내 자신이 더 잘 알고 있지 않느냐고.’\\n\\u3000확실히 그런 상황이 온다면 그녀가 나를 비참하게 만들 것이라는 분명했다. 나도 그 사실을 인정하지 않을 수 없었다. 결국 내 자신에게 이렇게 말할 수밖에 없었다. “핍(주인공이름), 넌 도대체 왜 이렇게 어 리석니!”\\n\\u3000우리는 걸으면서 상당히 많은 얘기들을 나누었다. 대개의 경우 비디의  판단이 옳았다.\\n\\u3000비디는 절대 남에게 상처를 입히는 말을 할 아이가 아니었다. 변덕 스럽지도 않았으며 오늘은 이런 모습이었다가 내일은 전혀 딴 모습을 하고서 내 앞에 나타날 아이도 아니었다.\\n\\u3000그녀(비디)는 나에게 고통을 주느니 차라리 그녀 자신이 즐거움을 빼앗기는 쪽을 택할 아이였고, 남에게 상처를 입히느니 차라리 그녀 자신의 심장 일부분을 도려낼  아이였다.\\n\\u3000그렇다면 모든 면에서 비디가 훨씬  더 괜찮은  여성인데, 도대체 나는 왜 에스텔라와 비디 둘 중에서 비디를 훨씬 더 좋아하지 못하는 걸까?\\n\\u3000“비디.” 집으로 돌아오는 길에 내가 말했다. “나는, 네가 나를 좀 바 로잡아주었으면 좋겠어.”\\n“그럴 수 있었으면 좋겠어!” 비디가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“만약 내가 너와 사랑에 빠질 수만 있다면…, 우린 오랫동안 친구사 이였으니까 이 정도 얘긴  괜찮겠지?”\\n\\u3000“가엾은 아이, 물론이고말고!” 비디가 말했다. “내  걱정  따윈 하지마.”\\n\\u3000“만약 내가 너랑 사랑에 빠질 수만 있다면 그럼 내게 더 좋은 일이될 텐데.”\\n\\u3000“아니 넌 절대 그럴 수 없을 거야, 네가 더 잘 알잖니.” 비디가 말했다.\\n\\u3000만약 우리가 이런 대화(사랑)를 몇  시간 전에  나누었더라면 그건 있을 법하지 않은 일이었었겠지만 이 아름다운 저녁에 그 말을 하고 나니 그것이(사랑) 나에게만은 전혀 있을 법하지 않은 일이 아닌 것 같이 들렸다.\\n\\u3000그러니 내가 이렇게 발언한 것도 당연했다. “글쎄, 난 잘 모르겠는데.”\\n\\u3000하지만 비디는 “아니, 넌 절대로 나를 사랑할 순 없을 거야.”라며 단호하게 말했고, 내 마음에서도 그녀의 말이 옳다고 믿었다. 그래도 가슴 아픈 사실이었다. 내가 그녀를 사랑하지 못할 것임을 그녀(비디)가 그렇게까지 확신하고 있었기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000우리가 ‘교회 부속의 묘지’(“주인공의 부모님”과, 몇 년 못살고 죽은 “주인공의 다섯 오누이들이 누워있는 곳”)에 다다랐을 때였다.\\n\\u3000집으로 가기 위해서는 이 지점에서 제방을 하나 건넌 후, 수문 근처에 있는 디딤대 하나를 더 건너야했다.\\n\\u3000그런데 바로 거기에서 수문에서인지 아니면 늪지대에서인지 그도 아니면 강바닥에 고여 있던 진흙에서부터인지 올릭(사악한 악당, 주인공의 누나를 때린 범인, 괴력의 소유자이자 대장간의 장인, 주인공을 싫 어함)이란 작자가 튀어나왔다. 스스로를 늙어빠진 올릭이라고 칭하고 다니는 악당 말이다. 강바닥에 괴여 썩어 있는 진흙이라는 이미지가 올릭과  정확하게 일치했다.\\n\\u3000“어쩔 시구!” 그가 비아냥거리며 말했다. “두 사람, 어디로 가는 길이지?”\\n“우리가 어디로 가겠어요,  집이지?”\\n“어쩔 씨구리, 그럴까.” 그가 말했다. “내가 집까지 두 사람을 바래다주지. 안 그럼 내가 벼락을 맞고 뒤질 수 있으니까!” \\n\\u3000“벼락 맞고 뒈질 수 있다.”는 형벌은 그(올릭, 사악한 악당)가 즐겨 사용하는 가정법이었다.\\n\\u3000내가 아는 한 그는 그 단어에 특별한 의미를 부여하고 있지 않았다.  다만 이 경우에도 그가 자신의 세례명을 혐오스럽게 지어 마을 사람들에게 기분 나쁜 인상을 주며 즐겼듯이, 이 “벼락 맞고 죽는다.”라는 말 에도 다른 사람을 모욕하고 자신이 남들보다 더 잔인하고 힘이 세다는 인상을 풍기기 위한 목적이  들어있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 더 어렸을 때였다. 나는 “그가 날을 잡아서 벼락으로 나를 맞출 것임을 그리고 그가 예리하고 무시무시한 갈고리로 사용해 나에게 벼락을 맞출 것임”을 난 찰떡같이 믿고 산 적이 있었다.\\n\\u3000그와 동행하는 것을 비디가 극도로 경계했다. 비디가 조용히 내게 말했다.\\n“그를 가까이 오게 하지마라죠. 난 왠지 그를 싫어.”\\n\\u3000나도 역시 그와 동행하는 것이 싫었기 때문에 예의에 어긋나는 건 줄은 알았지만, 말은 고맙지만 그가 우리를 집까지 바래다주는 것을 우리가 원하지 않는다고  말했다.\\n\\u3000그는 내 대답에 큰 웃음을 한 번 내지르더니 받아들이곤 뒤로 떨어져 걸었다. 하지만 약간의 거리를 유지한 채 우리의 뒤를 따라왔는데, 언제나처럼 상체를 앞으로 푹 수그린 채 축 처진 자세로 걷고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 알고 싶어졌다. 내 누나가 다 말하지 못했던 그 살인적인 공격을 가한 범인으로 비디가 올릭을 의심하고 있는 것은 아닌지 나는 알고 싶어졌다.\\n나는 비디에게 그를(올릭)를 왜 싫어하는지 물어보았다.\\n\\u3000“아! 그건….” 비디가 어깨너머로 “구부정한 자세로 우리 뒤에서 걸어오고 있는 올릭(악당)”을 대충 훑어보면서 말했다. “그건… 그가 나를 좋아하는 것 같기 때문이야.”\\n“그가 널 좋아한다고  말한  적이  있니?”  내가  화를  내며  물었다. “아니.”  비디가  다시  한  번 더  그녀의 어깨너머를 대충 훑어보며  말\\n했다. “그가 그렇게 말한 적은 없어. 하지만 나와 눈이 마주칠 때마다  나를 보며 춤을 춰대.”\\n\\u3000이 애착의 증거가 너무도 새롭고 이상하다고 하더라도, 도무지 비디의 해석을 부정활  수가  없었다. 올릭 같은  작자가 감히  비디를 마음속에 품고 있다니, 난 정말로 화가 났고, 마치 그 폭행이 내 자신에게 가 해진 기분이었다.\\n\\u3000“하지만 분명 너와는 상관없는 일이야, 알지.” 비디가 침착하게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그래, 비디, 그건 나와 상관없는 일이야, 하지만 난 그 자체가 싫어. 그리고 저자가 너를 좋아하는 것 자체가 싫어. 도저히 용납할 수 없어.”\\n\\u3000“그건 나도 그래. 하지만 이건 너와는 아무런 상관이 없는 일이야.” 비디가  다시 말했다.\\n\\u3000“맞아.” 내가 말했다. “하지만 너에게 이 말만은 꼭 해야겠어. 비디, 만약 저자가 너를 보고 춤추는 것에 네가 이의를 제기하지 않는다면 난 너를 별로 탐탁지 않게 생각할 수밖엔 없을 거야.”\\n\\u3000그 날 밤 이후로 나는 올릭을 눈여겨보기 시작했고, 혹이라도 그가 비디를 바라보며 춤을 춰댈 만한 상황이 벌어지려면 그자의 앞으로 끼 어들어 그가 그 막춤을 춰댈 상황을 미리 막았다.\\n\\u3000그는 이제 조(주인공의 매형)의 대장간에 단단히 뿌리를 박고 살고 있었다. 왜냐하면 내 누나가 갑자기 그 자를 좋아하기 시작했기 때문이다. 하지만, 나는 분명 그 자를 해고시키기 위해 그때 최선을 다했어 야했다.\\n\\u3000그도 내 선한 의도들(쫒아내고 싶지만 누나를 위해 어쩔 수없이 참 는다)을 더 잘 알게 되었고 그에 보답했다. 물론 나는 그 이유를 한참 뒤에야  알게 되지만….\\n\\u3000그건 그렇고, 비디와의  대화가 있고 나서도 내 마음은 오랫동안 갈피를 못하고 있었다. 나도 다음과 같은 생각으로 내 주변을 정리하려고 했었다.\\n\\u3000‘누가 봐도 비디가 에스텔라보다 착한 여자다. 그리고 내게 주어진 평의하고 수수한 노동자의 삶을 생각해보았을 때에도 에스텔라보다 비 디가 헤아릴 수 없을 만큼 나와 더 잘 어울리는 여자다. 또한 정직한 노동에의 삶은 내가 부끄러워할 성질의 아니며 그런 노동자의 삶이 오 히려 내게 일상의 행복을 가져다줄 것이다.’\\n\\u3000하지만 이건 생각뿐이었고 실제 내 머릿속은 비디와의 대화가 있기 전보다 오 만배는 더 주름이 져 있었다.\\n\\u3000여러 번의 계절들이 지나고 수많은 일들이 있었지만 머릿속의 혼란은 가라앉지 않았다. 결국 나는 다음과 같이 최종적으로 결심하는 쪽을 택했다.\\n\\u3000‘나는, 내 친애하는 조(매형)와 대장간에 대해 더 이상의 불만을 가지고 있지 않아. 이대로 내가 어른이 된다면 솜씨 좋은 대장장이가 될 것이고 그럼 조와 파트너 관계를 형성할 수 있고 내가 비디에게 청혼할  승산이 높아져.’\\n\\u3000하지만 이런 생각들의 와중에도 미스 해비샴의 저택에서 있었던 일들이 갑자기 생각나기 시작했고 그럼 내 결심은 산산조각 흩어지고 나는 도로 바보가 되고 말았다.\\n\\u3000산산조각 난 내 지혜는 다시 회복하는 데 오랜 시간이 걸렸으며, 대개의 경우는 내가 그 흩어진 지혜의 조각들을 다 모으기도 전에 이번   에는 또 다른 생각 ‘혹시 내 수습공 기간이 끝나는 대로 미스 해비샴 (갑부)이 내게 막대한 재산을 한 목 단단히 챙겨주지 않을까?’하는 검은 생각이 들었고, 그럼 그나마 손에 쥐고 있던 작은 지혜들까지 도로 산산조각 나 흩날리고  말았다.\\n\\u3000감히 고백하건데 아마 내가 내 수습공 기간을 다 채웠다 하더라도  나는 내가 쌓아올린 수수께끼들에 짓눌려 여전히 빠져나오지 못하고 있었을 것이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 나는 내 수습공 기간을 다 채우지 못했고, 나는 채 잉태되지  않은 상태에서 세상 밖으로 뛰쳐나와야 했다. 그 이야기는 다음에 계속하겠다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 18장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000내가 조(착하지만 많이 어리숙한, 주인공의 매형)의 수습공이 된지 4 년째로 접어드는 밤이었다. 그 날이 토요일 밤이었던 걸로 기억한다.\\n\\u3000우리는 “쾌활한 세 명의 바지선 선원들”(술집이름)에 모여 있었다. 가운데에는 난롯불이 놓여있었고 우리는 둥글게 자리 잡고 있었다. 우리는 웹슬 씨가 큰 목소리로 읽어주는 신문기사 내용에 집중하고 있었다. 그 무리(사람들) 속에 나도 있었다.\\n\\u3000당시 모든 신문지상을 장식하고 있던 살인사건에 관한 기사였다. 웹슬 씨는 눈썹까지 피로 물들인 채 살인사건에 몰입하고 있었다. 그는 신문기사에 나와 있는 진저리나는 모든 형용사들을 흡족한 듯 바라보 고 있었고, 자신을 피해자의 사인을 조사하기 위해 모인 증인들 하나 하나와 동일시하고 있었다. 그는 그렇게 신문을 읽어 내려가고 있었다. 그는 희생자의 입장에 서서 “난 이제 글렀어.”라며 힘없이 신음 소리를 내기도 하고, 영락없는 살인자의 입장이 되어선 “네 놈에게 복수\\n하리라.”라며 악랄하게 으르렁거리고  있었다.\\n\\u3000그는 우리 지방 개업 의사의 흉내를 신랄하게(날카롭게) 내며 이 살 인사건에 대한 의학적인 증언을 하고 있었고, 수차례의 가격(때림) 소리를 들은 나이 든 마찻길 수납원이 되어 몹시도 동요한 나머지 새된 목소리로 당시 사건을 묘사하고 있었다. 어느 정도로까지 그의 연기가 리얼했는지 그가 중풍에 걸린 환자 연기를 너무나도 잘 하는 바람에 우리 모두는 마찻길 수납원의 증인으로써의 정신적 적격성에 의심을 품었을 정도다.\\n\\u3000검시관(조사관)은 이제 웹슬 씨의 손에서 아테네의 타이몬(고대의 철 학자이름)이 되어 있었고, 교구 직원(대학총장 도우미)은 이제 코리올 리누스(고대 로마 장군)가 되어  있었다.\\n\\u3000웹슬 씨는 철저하게 자신을 즐기고 있었으며 그 자리에 모인 우리들    도 우리 자신을 즐기고 있었다. 즐겁고 기분 좋은 토요일 밤이었다.\\n\\u3000그런 아늑한 분위기 속에서 우리는 “그 살인사건이 잔인무도한 살인 자의 고의적인 살인이다”라는 판결을 내리게 되었다.\\n\\n(옮긴이 : 잠깐 딴 얘기 하나 시작)\\n\\u3000깜빡하고 말을 안 했는데, 『 위대한 유산 』 은 18장부터 이야기가 본격적으로 진행됩니다. 이전과는  이야기 전개가  확  달라짐. 1장부터 17장까지는 주인공의 어린 시절을 다룬 내용들이 많아 좀 슬픈 내용이었는데, 18장 이후부터는 런던으로 상경해 영국신사가 되어가는 과정임.\\n\\u3000그 사이 제 블로그 구독자 수도 큰 변화가 있었음. 1장을 올릴 때 23명이던 구독자수가 지금은 3명으로 뚝↓ (-_-; 요즘 글 올리면 포스팅 당 하루 평균 조회 수 3명 많이 나오면 8명. 소설이 본격적인 궤도에 오르기도 전에 구독자들이 다 떨어져 나간 웃지도 울지도 못할 경우임.\\n블로그 하루 총 방문자 수가 500명인데 그 중에 정작 『위대한 유\\n산 』 구독자는 3명뿐임. 과연 위대한 유산을 다 끝마칠 때까지 3명인 블로그 구독자 분들이 남아날지 그게 더 걱정이 되는 요즘임~ 걱정된다, 마음 블로그~,~  견뎌줘!\\n(잠깐 딴 얘기 하나 끝)\\n\\n\\u3000내가 내 맞은편 의자에 등을 기댄 채 앉아 우리를 지켜보고 있는 낮선 신사 한명을 발견한 것은 바로 그때였다. 그의 얼굴에는 온갖 경멸의 감정이 가득했다. 그는 엄청나게 큰 자신의 집게손가락 옆쪽을 이빨로 물어뜯으며 우리 일행을 구경하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“자!” 웹슬 씨의 낭독이 끝나마자 그 낮선  신사가  단도직입적으로 웹슬 씨에게 질문을 던졌다. “당신은 당신 자신의 만족을 위해 이 모든 판결을 내렸겠지요? 저는 그럴 것이라고 믿어 의심치 않는데 그렇지 않습니까?”\\n\\u3000우리 모두는 흠칙 놀라 마치 진짜 살인자가 나타난 것처럼 그를 쳐 다보았다. 그는 우리 모두를 아주 차갑게 아주 빈정대며 살피고 있었다.\\n“유죄다, 당연한 거 아닌가?” 그가 말했다. “자 말해 보시오, 어서!” “선생” 웹슬 씨가 되받아치며 말했다. “당신을 아는 영광을 가지진\\n못했지만, 나는 이 사건이 유죄라고 말하는 바이오.”\\n\\u3000웹슬 씨가 그렇게 말하자 우리들도 용기를 내 이 사건은 유죄가 틀 림없다고 중얼 중얼거리며 말할 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“당연히 그러시겠지요.” 낮선 신사가 말했다. “당신이 그렇게 나오실줄 알았습니다. 제가 방금 말씀드렸지  않습니까?  당신이 막 유죄 판결을 내리셨다고. 그럼 제가 질문 하나를 더 드리죠. ‘피고인이 유죄로 판결이 확정될 때까지는 무죄로 추정한다.’는 원칙이  우리나라(영국) 법에 있음을 당신은 아시는 거요, 아님 모르시고서 방금 그 판결을 내 리셨던 것이요? 무죄추정의 원칙  말이오.”\\n\\u3000“선생” 웹슬 씨가 대답하기 시작했다. “내 자신도 자랑스러운 영국 인이기 때문에, 그러니까  난….”\\n\\u3000“어서  대답해 보시오!” 그 낮선 신사가 또 다시 자신의  집게손가락을 물어뜯으며 웹슬 씨에게 말했다. “질문을 회피하지 마시오. 얼버무 리지도 마시오. 무죄추정의 원칙을 아시는 거요, 모르셨던 거요? 어느 쪽이요?”\\n\\u3000낮선 신사는 머리를 한 쪽으로 기울이고 몸은 저 쪽으로 기울인 채 서 있었다. 그의 태도는 고압적이었고 질문공세는 계속해서 이어지고 있었다. 도살장에서 어느 소가 다음 차례인지를 지목하듯이 그는 자신의 집게손가락으로 웹슬 씨(연극배우를 꿈꾸는 교회서기)를 지목하고 있었다. 그런 후 꼭 자신의 집게손가락 옆쪽을 물어뜯었다.\\n\\u3000“자!” 그가 말했다. “당신은 아시고 계셨던 것이오, 모르시고 있었던 것이요? 무죄추정의 원칙  말이오.”\\n“물론 저도 알고 있었지요.” 웹슬 씨가 대답했다.\\n\\u3000“당연히 당신이 그렇게 답할 줄 알았소. 그렇다면 당신은 왜 그 사실을 미리 말하지 않은 것이오? 자 다음 질문으로 넘어가겠소.” 이건 뭐 자신에게 웹슬 씨를 심문할 권리가 충분히 있다는 자신만만한 표정 이었다. 그가 계속 말했다. “당신은 이 살인사건의 증인들 중 어느 누구도 반대심문을 받지 않았다는 사실을 아시오?”\\n“다만 제가 말씀드릴 수 있는 것은….” (←웹슬 씨가 한 말) 웹슬 씨가 말을 시작하자마자 낮선 신사가 제지하며 나섰다.\\n\\u3000“그래서 예스요? 노요? 내 질문에 대답하지 않으실 작정이오? 자 다시 한 번 당신에게 기회를 주리다.” 그 낮선 신사가 또 다시 자신의 집게손가락 끝으로 웹슬 씨를 꼭 찝어서 지목하며 말했다. “나를 납득 시켜보시오, 선생. 그 사건의 증인들 중 지금까지 어느 누구도 반대신문을 받지 않았다는 사실을 알고 계셨던 것이오, 아님 인지하지 못한 것이오? 자, 어서 말해보시오. 내가 당신에게서 듣고 싶은 말은 이것뿐 이오.  예스요? 노요?”\\n\\u3000웹슬 씨가 말을 더듬었다. 그래서 우리 모두는 웹슬 씨에 대해 다소 좋지 않은 의견을 마음속에 품기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000“자 어서!” 낮선 신사가 말했다. “내가  도와주리다. 당신은  도움을 받을 자격이 없지만, 하지만 난 당신을 도와주겠소. 그 종이를 보시오. 당신이 쥐고 있는 그 종이를 보시란 말이오. 그게 대체 무엇이요?”\\n\\u3000“이게 뭐냐고요?” 웹슬 씨가 눈으로 자신이 들고 있는 신문을 내려 다보면서 되풀이해 말했다. 웹슬 씨는 지금 아주 당황해 있었다.\\n\\u3000“그것은.” 낮선 신사가 최대한의 경멸을 가득 담아 비아냥거리는 말 투로 질문 공세를 계속해서 이어갔다. “당신이 지금 막 읽었던 인쇄된 신문이 아니오?”\\n“틀림없이 그렇소.”\\n\\u3000“명백해졌소. 자, 그럼 다음 장(페이지)을 넘겨보시오. 그리고 내게 들려주시오. 그 신문기사에 ‘죄수의 고문 변호사가 해당 죄수에게 자신에 대한 모든 변호를 일단 뒤로 미루라고 지시했다고 한다.’라는 기사가 나와 있는지 안 나와 있는지 어서 내게 들려주시오.”\\n“저도 지금 막 그 기사를 읽었습니다.” 웹슬 씨가 답변했다.\\n\\u3000“당신이 지금 그 기사를 읽고 있는지 아닌지는 지금 이 자리에서 중 요한 것이 아니요. 그런 것에 신경 쓰지 마시오. 내가 묻고 있는 것은 당신이 그 기사를 지금 막 읽었느냐가 아니었소. 이제 보니 당신은 당신이 원하기만 하면 주기도문(주된 기도문)을 거꾸로 라도 읽을 수는 사람인 것 같소. 물론 이전엔 분명 그렇게 하며  살아왔을  것이오. 자  다음 페이지를 넘겨보시오. 아니, 아니, 아니, 칼럼(해당 사건에 대한 신문사의 짧은 논평) 위쪽을 보란 얘기가 아니었소. 잘 아시면서 왜 그 러시오, 자 칼럼 아래를, 칼럼 아래를 보시오.”\\n\\u3000우리 모두는 웹슬 씨가 속임수로 가득 찬 사람이라고 생각하기 시작 했다.\\n낮선 신사가 말했다. \\n“자? 찾으셨소?”\\n“여기에 나와 있군요.” 웹슬 씨(교회서기)가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“자 그럼 당신 눈으로 직접 그 구절을 읽어보시오. 그리고 내게 말해주시오. ‘자신의 모든 변호를 일제히 뒤로 미루라는 지시를 피의자는 자신의 고문 변호사부터 받았다고 명백히 밝히고 있다’는 해당구절이 칼럼(신문논평) 하단에 분명히 나와 있는지 안 나와 있는지를 어서 내게 말해주시오. 자 어서! 어서! 그것이 확실하게 나와 있소?”\\n\\u3000웹슬 씨가 대답했다. “그렇게까지 단정적인 언어들로 나와 있지는 않소.”\\n\\u3000“단정적인 언어들로 나와 있지는 않다!” 낮선 신사가 꽥 소리를 내지르며 웹슬 씨의 말을 따라 말했다. “그렇지만 그것이 그 칼럼(논평)의 정확한 요지지  않소?”\\n“그렇소.” 웹슬 씨가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“그렇소.” 낮선 신사가 또 따라서 말했다. 낮선 신사는 오른손을 이젠 영락없는 증인이 된 웹슬 씨를 향해 쭉 뻗은 채 우리들을 돌아보았다. “자 이제 당신들에게 묻겠소. 저 사람(웹슬 씨)의 양심에 대해 당신들은 무어라고 말들 하시겠소? 자기 눈앞에 피의자의 해명이 분명 적혀있는데도 피의자의 해명은 일체 들어주지도 않고 동료  영국인을 향해 ‘저자는 유죄다’라고 선고한 후 자기 베개 위에 머리를 편안히 대 고서 이 세상에서 가장 편안한 낮잠을 잘 수 있는 저자의 양심에 대해 당신들은 내게 무어라고  대답하시겠소?”\\n\\u3000우리 모두는 ‘웹슬 씨가 우리가 생각해왔었던 그런 사람이 아님’을 알아채기 시작했다. 또한 우리 모두는 ‘웹슬 씨의 흉계가 들통 나기 시작하고 있음’을 눈치 챌 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“그리고 기억해두시오, 바로 저와 같은 사람이,” 낮선 신사는 자신의 손가락으로 웹슬 씨를 묵직하게 가리키며 말을 이어갔다. “바로 저와  같은 사람이 이 재판의 배심원들 중 한 명으로 소집될 지도 모른다는 사실을 말이오. 그럼 그는 앞서 말한 바와 같이 대단히 잘못된 편견에 휩싸인 채 판결을 내릴 것이며 그래놓고는 가족의 품으로 돌아가 자기 베개 위에 머리를 대고 곤히 잠들 수 있는 사람임을 여러분들은 기억 해두시오. 바로 저 사람이 ‘우리 국왕 폐하’와 ‘재판정에 선 피의자’ 사이에 서서 이 이슈를 평결(배심원끼리 의견 후 유죄유무 결정)함에 있어 건전하고 진실한 판단을 내리겠다고 재판정에서 엄숙히 맹세한 저 사람이, 그리고 재판에 임함에 있어 증거에 의해서만 참으로 진실 된 평결을 내리겠다고 재판관 앞에서 엄숙히 맹세한 저와 같은 자들이야 말로…, 오 하느님 저자에게 구원을 내려주소서!”\\n\\u3000이것으로 웹슬 씨의 입지는 끝장이 났다. 우리 모두는 낮선 신사의 논리에 완전히 설득 당했고 불쌍하게도 ‘웹슬 씨가 함부로 유죄 판단을 내렸다는 사실과 어찌되었던 아직 시간이 많이 지나지 않았을 때 웹슬 씨가 어서 빨리 자신의 선언을 취소하는 것이 좋겠구나.’라고 생각했던 것이다.\\n   이제 낮선 신사는 우리 앞에서 이의를 제기할 수 없는 권위 있는 모습을 하고서 그리고 만약 그가 폭로하기로 마음만 먹는다면 우리 개 개인의 비밀을 효과적으로 까발릴 어떤 비밀을 자신은 이미 알고 있다는 태도를 풍기며 자신의 자리를 떠나 난로불 앞에 있는 두 의자 사이에 있는 빈 공간으로 들어왔다. 그 자리에 서서 낮선 신사는 호주머니에 왼손을 집어넣은 채 그리고 오른손 집게손가락 옆쪽을 자근자근 씹 으면서 우리 앞에 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000“제가 받은 정보에 의하면,” 우리 모두가 메추라기가 된 양 겁을 집어먹고 있을 때 그 낮선 신사가 우리를 돌아보며 말했다. “당신들 중에 대장장이 양반이 계시지 않소.  이름이  ‘요셉’ 그  뭐더라 ‘조’ 그래  ‘조 가저리 씨’라고 하는 분 말이오. 어느 분이시오?”\\n\\u3000“아 접니다.” 조(주인공의 매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물, 주인 공이 배신하는 인물)가  말했다.\\n\\u3000낮선 신사가 자기  쪽으로 오라며 손짓했다. 그래서  조가 그리로 갔다.\\n\\u3000“당신에게 수습공이 있지요.” 낮선 신사가 계속 말했다. “사람들이 핍이라고들 부른다는데? 그 애가 지금 여기 와 있소?”\\n“저에요!” 내가 고함치며  말했다.\\n\\u3000낮선 신사는 나를 알아보지 못했다. 하지만 나는 그를 알아봤었다. 예전에 내가 미스 해비샴의 저택을 방문해 계단을 올라가고 있을 때 딱 마주친 신사였다. 그것은 내 두 번째 방문이었을 것이다. 나는 우리를 구경하고 있는 그를 발견하는 순간 이미 직감했다. ‘그 놈이다’라고.(←“‘그 놈이다’라고”라는 문장은 원문에 없는데 추가해보았습니 다.-_-)\\n\\u3000그리고 지금 내 앞에 서서 손을 내 어깨 위에 올려놓고 서 있는 그와 마주보게 되자 나는 다시 한 번 그의 외모를 눈여겨보기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000역시나 몸에 비해 과도하게 큰  그의  머리와, 짙은(검은)  피부색(안 색), 깊게 패인 두 눈과, 텁수룩하고 검은 색을 한 두 눈썹들, 그리고 커다란 회중시계(조끼에 넣고 다니는 시계)의 쇠줄과, 턱수염과 구레나 릇(수염)을 말끔하게 깍지 못해 남아 있는 짙고 검은 색을 한 수많은  점들, 심지어 그의 커다란 손에서 나는 향기로운 비누냄새까지도 나는 다시 한 번 더 체크해보고 있었다. \\n\\u3000“나는 당신네 두 사람과 사적인 대화를  좀 나누고 싶소만.” 느긋하게 내 얼굴을 살펴보던 낮선 신사가 말했다. “시간이 조금 걸릴 것이 오(이야기가 길어질 것이오). 당신 거주지로 가는 게 좋겠소. 내가 당 신네들에게 전해줘야 할 얘기를 여기서 모두 하기는 좀 그러니까. 나중에 당신네들이 직접 당신 친구들에게 그 얘기를 많이 들려주든 혹은 적게 들려주든 하시오. 그건 나랑 상관없으니까.”\\n\\u3000궁극의(불가사의한) 침묵에 둘러싸인 우리 세 사람은 “세 명의 쾌활한 바지선 선원들”(술집이름)을 나와 우리 집을 향해 걸어갔다. 집으로 가는 동안에도 침묵이 우리 세 사람을 에워싸고 있었다.\\n\\u3000집으로 가는 길에 낮선 신사는 이따금씩 나를 쳐다보며 자기 집게손가락의  옆쪽을 물어뜯었다.\\n\\u3000우리 집에 가까이 왔을 때였다. 조(매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물)가 막연하게나마 낮선 신사의 방문이 나름 엄숙하고 의식을 차리는 의식이 되어야한다고 생각한 모양이었다. 조가 우리들보다 미리 달려가 정문을 열어주었다.\\n\\u3000우리들의 대화는 응접실에서 이루어졌다. 촛불 하나가 무기력하게(희 미하게) 우리들을 밝혀주고  있었다.\\n\\u3000낮선 신사가 식탁에 앉으면서 이야기가 시작되었다. 낮선 신사는 먼저 촛불을 자기 쪽으로 끌어당겨 호주머니에 있던 수첩에서 몇 가지를 확인한 후 수첩을 도로 호주머니에 넣고 촛불을 다시 반대쪽으로 밀어 놓은 후 말했다.\\n\\u3000낮선 신사는 조(주인공의 매형)와 나(18세)를 포함해 응접실을 한 바퀴 둘러본 후 다음과 같은 사실을 확인해주었다.\\n\\u3000“내 이름은,” 낮선 신사가 말했다. “‘재거스’요. 런던에서 변호사 일을 하고 있소. 나는 이 분야에서 좀 유명합니다. 전 당신네들과 관련해서 상당히 기묘한 사안 하나를 가지고 왔소. 내가 이 일을 제안한 게 아님을 먼저 밝히는 바이오. 만약 내 의견이 반영되었다면 난 이 자리에 있지도 않았을 것이오. 내 질문은 받아들여지지도 않았으니까. 그래서 당신네들이  보다시피 난 지금 여기에 와 있는 것이오. 나는 의뢰인의 밀사로서 여기에 왔으며 내가 해야 할 업무만 하려는 바이오. 그 이상도 그 이하도  아니오.”\\n\\u3000그가 눈치 챘다. 자신이 앉아 있는 자리에서는 그가 우리를 잘 볼 수 없다는 것을 그가 눈치 챘다. 그가 자리에서 일어나 한 쪽 다리를  ‘의자 등’ 너머로 넘기곤 ‘의자 등’에 의지해 섰다. 그러므로 그는 한쪽 발은 의자(앉는 자리) 위에 디디고 서 있었고, 다른 쪽 발로는 응접실 바닥을 디디며 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000“자, 요셉 가저리(주인공의 매형 이름)씨. 내가 여기에 온 이유는 당신에게 ‘당신과 계약관계에 있는 이 어린 수습공의 해고를 제안한다.’는 말을 전달해주기 위해서요. 저 아이가  원하고  그것이 저  아이를  위한 길이라면 당신께서는 이 계약 취소 제안을 반대하지는 않으시겠소?   그 대가로 당신이 바라는 건 없겠소?”\\n\\n\\n\\u3000“저는  핍(주인공의 이름, 18세)의 앞길에 보탬이 되지  않는 어떤 다른 행동도 하고 싶지 않아야 합니다.  그것이  하느님의  명령이시니까 요.” 조가 재거스(런던 변호사)를 빤히 쳐다보며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“엥? 하느님의 명령이 뭐요? 그건 경건한(신앙심이 깊은) 대답일 수는 있지만 사리에 맞지 않는 말이오.” 재거스 씨(런던 유명 변호사)가 되받아치며 말했다. “내 질문은 ‘당신이 바라는 것이 없느냐 있느냐?’ 였소.”\\n\\u3000“제 대답은,” 조(주인공의 매형)가 엄한 목소리로 대꾸했다. “아니올 시다요.”\\n\\u3000재거스 씨가 조를 빤히 쳐다보기 시작했다. 내 생각에 그는 지금 자기 직업의 습관상 조의 사심 없는 대답을 어느 바보가 한 농담쯤으로 간주하고 있는 듯  했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그때쯤은 나도 너무 당황해서 제정신이 아니었다. 나는 숨 막히는 호기심과 놀람 사이에서 갈피를 못 잡고 있었고, 그래서 재거스 씨의 생각을 확인하고 말고 할 틈이 없었다.\\n\\u3000“그럼 좋소.” 재거스 씨가 말했다. “당신이 방금 계약 해지를 동의했음을 유념해두시오. 이내 곧 생각이 바뀌었네 마네 하지 않게 당신이  방금 계약 해지를 허락했음을 기억해두시오.”\\n“누가 생각을 바꾸네 마네 한다는 겁니까?” 조가 삐딱하게 말했다. “누군가가 그럴 거라는 의미는 아니었소. 혹시, 당신 개 키웁니까?” “한 마리 키우고  있소.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 명심해두시오. “폼 잡는 ‘개’” 좋은 개라는 사실을 말이요. 하지만 당신은 이걸 더 명심해두셔야 갰소. “자기 몫부터 챙기는 ‘개’” 더 좋은 개라는 사실을 말이오. 어떻게 명심이 되시겠소?” 재거스 씨가 눈을 감은 채 그리고 조(매형)를 향해 고개를 끄덕이며 말했다. 마치 자신이 방금 조에게 관용을 베풀어주었다는 태도 같았다.\\n재거스 씨가 계속 말했다. “자 이제 어린 친구(주인공, 18세) 얘기로 돌아갑시다. 내가 전달해주어야 하는 내용은 ‘저 애가 막대한 유산을  받게  되었다’는 것이오.”\\n\\u3000조(매형)와 나(18세)는 숨이 막혀 제대로 숨도 쉴 수 없을 지경이었다. 우린 서로를 쳐다보고  있었다.\\n\\u3000“나는 이 얘기를 그에게 전해주라는 지식을 받았소.” 재거스 씨(런던 변호사)가 자신의 집게손가락을 옆에 있던 내게 던지며 말했다. “그가  큰 재산을 유산으로 물려받게 될 거라는 것을 말이오. 뿐만 아니라, 저 애는 지금 즉시 자신의 주거환경과 직장에서 떠나 요컨대 막대한 유산을 상속받을 예정에 있는 젊은 친구들이 응당 그렇게 하듯 저 애도 이 제부터 자기 재산에 합당한 신사가 되기 위한 교육을 받아야하오. 이것이 현재 그 재산을 소유한 사람의 바램이오.”\\n\\u3000내 꿈은 실현되었다. 내 미친 몽상이 이제 진지한 현실이 되서 나타난 것이다. 어마어마한 스케일로 미스 해비샴(갑부)이 내게 그녀의 재산을 넘겨주려고 하고 있는 것이다.\\n\\u3000“자, 핍 씨.” 변호사가 계속해서 말했다. “내가 자네에게 전해야 할 나머지 이야기들도 마저 하겠네. 재산을 상속받기 위해 자네는 다음과 같은 조건을 받아들여야 하네. 자네는 항상 핍이라는 이름을 간직해야 하네. 지금까지 자네 이름이 핍이었듯이 앞으로도 자네의 이름은 핍이 어야 하네. 이것이 나에게 지침을 내린 의뢰인의 요구네. 이런 막대한 유산을 상속받는 조건치곤 너무 간단하지 않은가? 내 생각에 자네에게도 반대의견은 없을 것 같군. 하지만 만약에라도 자네에게 반대 의견이 있다면 지금이 적기니 어서 말해보게.”\\n\\u3000내 심장은 미친 듯이 뛰고 있었고 내 고막은 미친 듯이 울리고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 어찌나 더듬거리며 말을 했는지 “반대 의견이 없어요.”라는 말을 입으로 했는지 귀로 했는지조차 모를 정도였다.\\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000(이번 페이지는 모두 ‘재거스 변호사’ 혼자서 말하는 대사입니다. 좀 기네요. 읽기 편하게 단락을 임의로 나눴음을 밝힙니다. 원래는 하나의 단락임. 요지는 “후원자가 누구인지 절대 알려하지 마라”입니다.)\\n\\n(재거스 변호사의 대사  시작)\\n\\n\\n\\u3000“물론 반대할 리가 없겠지! 자 두 번째 상속조건에 대해 말하겠네. 핍 씨, 자네에게 너그러운 이 후원자의 이름에 대해 자네는 극비에  붙어야 하네. 당사자가 자기 이름을 스스로  밝히기로  결정하기  전까진 절대 알려고 해서 안  되네.\\n\\u3000내가 언급해줄 수  있는 부분은 단지, 당사자가 자네에게 자기  입으로 직접 자신의 이름을 말하려는 의도인 것 같다는 거네. 그 의도가  언제 어디에서 어떤 방식으로 이루어질 것인지는 나도 말할 수 없네. 나뿐만이 아니라 어느 누구도 말할 수  없을 걸세. 아마 수년이 더 걸릴  지도 모르겠네.\\n\\u3000또한, 자네는 확실히 알고 있어야 하네. 자네는 이후 나와 나누는 모든 대화에서 어떤 경우라도 후원자의 이름을 물어서는 안 되네. 지나가는 식으로라도 물어서는 안 되며 또한 후원자가 이 사람은 아닌지? 또 저 사람은 아닌지? 하는 식의 암시를 내게 던져서도 안 되네. 그런  유의 질문 자체가 자네에게는 금지될 것이네.\\n\\u3000만약 후원자가 누구인지 의심이 가는 사람이 생긴다면 그건 그냥 자네 가슴속에서만 심어두게. 상속조항에 왜 이런 금지조항이 있는지 이건 중요치 않네. 이런 금지조항은 누군가의  어마어마한  비밀일  수도 있고 혹은 어떤 식의 엄숙한 맹세 혹은 그저 누군가의 일시적인 변덕일 수도 있기 때문이네. 자네는 이것에 대해서도 알려 해서는 안 되네. 자, 이것이 상속조건이네. 모두 정해져 있지. 자네가 후원자의 비밀을 지킬 것에 동의하는지? 그래서 이 후한 후원자가 누구인지 알려하지  않겠음을  지킬  것인지? 이것이  유일한  상속조건이네. 그것은  또한\\n내가 자네에게서 확인 받아야할 임무이기도 하네.\\n\\u3000내게 지시를 내린  사람은  오직  그것만을  확인하고  싶어  했으니까. 그 밖의  다른 것들은 전혀 문제가 되지 않지. 내가 책임질 일도 아니고.\\n\\u3000결론은 자네에게 상속하기로 결정한 사람이 누구인지는 오직 당사자와 나만이 알고 있어야 한다는 것이네.\\n\\u3000다시 한 번 말하겠네, 이런 갑부(부자)가 되는 길에 이 정도의 방해물 이 정도의 조건이면 그다지 힘든 것도 아니지 않나. 그래도 혹시해서 물어보겠네.\\n\\u3000만약 자네에게 이 조건(후원자가 누구인지 절대 알려하지 마라)을 지키는 것에 반대의견이 있다면 지금 내게  말해주게.  지금이  그것을 말할 적기니까. 어서  말해보게.”\\n\\n(재거스 변호사의 대사 끝) \\n\\n\\u3000나는 다시 한 번 “저는 반대의견이 없어요.”라며 말까지 더듬어가며 간신히 내 의견을  표출했다.\\n\\u3000“물론 그렇게 말할 줄 알았네! 자, 핍 씨, 우리의 계약은 이것으로 체결되었네.”\\n\\u3000그는 비록 나를 핍 씨라며 존칭으로 불렀지만 확실히 내게 잘 보이려고 알랑거리는 태도를 보이기 시작했다. 하지만 그럼에도 불구하는 나를 대하는 그의 태도와 말투에는 어떤 종류의 위협이 들어있었는데, 그건 내가 이제 막 어떤 불법적이고 부정직할 영역에 발을 들여놓기 시작했으며 그래서 자신이 지금 당장 나를 괴롭혀주고 싶다는 딱 그런 뉘앙스였다.\\n\\u3000심지어 지금은 말을 계속 하면서도 두 눈을 감은 채 자신의 집게손 가락만을 내게 마구 던져대며 얘기를 계속하고 있었다. 네 부정쯤은 세상에 까발릴 자료들을 나는 다 가지고 있다. 뭐 이런 뉘앙스를 품겼고 문제는 단지 자신이 언제 그걸 터뜨릴 지 마음먹느냐는 뉘앙스였다.\\n그가  계속 말했다.\\n\\u3000“자 계약세부항목들로 들어가 보세. 자네는 알아두어야 하네. 내가  비록 ‘유산’이란 용어를 한 차례 이상 사용했지만 자네는 유산만 상속받는 것이 아니네. 자네는 이제 곧 자네 재산에 합당한 더 좋은 교육을 받기로 예정되어 있으며 그 비용을 충당하기에도 충분히 더 많은 돈이 내게 보관되어 있네. 나를 이제부터 자네 후견인으로 생각해주게. 참!”\\n\\u3000내가 막 그에게 “감사합니….”란 말을 하려는데 그가 내 말을 제지하며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이 얘기도 해야겠군. 난 이번 일에 대해 보수를 받고 있네. 그렇지 않다면 이번 일엔 일절 관여하지도 않았을 것이네. 나는 생각하네. 자네는 바뀐 신분에 걸맞은 더 좋은 교육을 받아야한다고. 자네도 만감하게 알아차렸을 것이네. 이 어드밴티지(남보다 앞서나감. 유산상속 받 음)를 가짐에 있어 그런 좋은 교육들이 얼마나 중요하고 필요불가결한 지를(필수적인지를).”\\n“그건(교육) 제가 항상 갈망해왔었던 바”라고 나는 말했다. \\n\\u3000“자네가 지금까지 간절히 기다리던 것에 신경 쓰지 말게, 핍 씨.” 그가 쏘아붙이며 말했다. “이야기를 새지 말라는 얘기네. 자네가 지금 그 것(교육)을 간절히 바란다면 그걸로 된 것이네. 그럼 어디 내가 대신 대답해볼까? 방금 자네가 한 말은 혹시 이것이 아니었나. ‘저는 합당한 선생님 밑에 들어가 배울 준비가 되어 있습니다.’ 그런가?”\\n내가 “예. 맞아요.”라며 더듬거리며  말했다.\\n\\u3000“좋아. 자 그럼, 자네 생각부터 들어볼까. 물론 내가 이렇게 말하는  것은 내가 자네 의견을 들어보기로 되어 있기 때문이지 자네 의견이 옳다거나 현명할 거라고 생각한다는 의미는 아니네. 그래 자네가 말하고 싶은 그 합당한 선생 이름이 무엇인가?”\\n\\u3000나는 ‘비디(20살 여, 예전에 마을 저녁학교 교사)’와 ‘웹슬 씨(교회서 기)의 대고모’ 이외에는 이름을 들어본 선생이 없었다. 그래서 “잘 모르겠다.”고 대답해주었다.\\n\\u3000“그럼. 내가 한 사람 알고 있지. 내 생각에 그 정도면 이 일에 적합할 것 같군. 어느 정도 배운 작자니까(사람이니까).” 재거스 씨(런던에서 유명한 변호사)가 말했다. “물론 이 경우에도 나는 그를 직접 추천하는 것이 아니네. 난 누구를 추천해주는 사람이 아니네. 절대 추천하지 않지. 자네가 아는 선생이 없을 경우 내가 추천해주기로 되어 있기 때문이네. 내가 지금 말하는 신사의 이름은 ‘매튜 포킷’이네.”\\n\\n아래는 부연설명(제가 쓴  글)\\n(매튜 포킷 :  젊은이들에게 신사교육을  시키는  사람.  젊어서는  공직에서 총망 받던 인물이었는데 엄청 높은 귀족가문의 딸과 사랑에 빠져 도망친 후 결혼하면서 더 이상 신분상승을 못하고 그 자리에서 주저앉은 사람. 더구나 귀족가문의 딸이 엄청난 귀족티를 내는 그런 여성이 었데, 그런데 알고 보니 진짜 귀족가문이 아니라 그녀의 할아버지 대에 귀족 작위를 정말로 받을 뻔했었던 가문이라는. 그에게 귀족작위를 주라는 말이 왕의 수첩 어딘가에 적혀 있었다는 등등)\\n\\n\\u3000(소설 속 등장인물들의 성 씨가 ‘포킷’인 경우가 여럿

나중에~)\\n\\u3000아하! 나는 그 이름(매튜 포킷)을 즉시 알아차릴 수 있었다(-_- 이런 모르는 줄 알고 18장에서 엄청 길게 부연설명 해놓았는데. 예측할 수 없는 저자의 행태라니-_-+). 그(매튜 포킷)는 미스 해비샴의 친 척이었다.\\n\\u3000내가 미스 해비샴의 저택을 처음 방문하던 날 대기실에서 카밀라 부 부(수다쟁이 부부)가 험담을 하고 있던 인물이 바로 매튜였다.\\n\\u3000또한 미스 해비샴이 “내가 죽어 저 신부테이블(결혼축하 케이크가 중앙에 있고 사람들을 맞을 준비를 하던  테이블)  위에 신부복차림을 하고 누워 있을 때 내 머리 맡에 있어야 할 작자”라고 지목한 사람이   바로 매튜였다.\\n\\u3000“어째 그를 아는 눈치구나?” 나를 기민하게(날카롭게) 살펴보며 재거스 씨(변호사)가 말했다. 그 질문을 던진 후 내 답변을 기다리는 동안  눈을 감았다.\\n“그의 이름에 대해 들어본 적이 있는  것  같아서요.”  내가  말했다. “그래!” 그가 말했다. “자네도 그의 이름을 들어봤군. 하지만 문제는\\n그게 아니야. 자네가 그에 대해 어떻게  생각하느냐지.  그렇지  않은 가?”\\n\\u3000나는 그 질문에 이렇게 말했다. 아니 아마도  쩔쩔매며 이렇게  말했을 것이다. “그를 추천해 주신 것에 대해 감사합니다. 큰 신세를 지게 되었습….”라고.\\n\\u3000“아니, 아니야 이 어린 친구야!” 그가 또 내 말을 자르며 자신의 큰 고개를 느릿느릿 흔들어대며 말했다. “진정해 전정하라고!”\\n\\u3000정신을 못 차린 나는 다시 한 번 이렇게 말하기 시작했다. “그를 추천해 주신 것에 대해 큰 신세를 지게 되었습….”\\n\\u3000“아니 아니라니까, 이 어린 친구야.” 그가 또 다시 고개를 흔들며 동시에 눈살을 찌푸리며 그와 동시에 반쯤은 웃으며 내 말을 막고 나섰다.  “노,  노, 노.  그 대답도 참 좋아, 하지만 그런 식은 안 되네. 그렇게 나를 곤경에 빠뜨리기에는 자네는 아직 경험이 없어. 추천은 자네가 사용할 적합한 단어가 아니네, 핍 씨. 자 어디 다시 한 번 대답해보게.” (재거스 씨는 지금 이 유산상속 문제에 자신은 변호사의 입장에서 이 일에 관여할 뿐이지 그 이상도 그 이하도 아님을 강조하고 있음)\\n\\u3000가까스로 정신을 차린 내가 “매튜 포킷 씨를 소개해주셔서 정말 감 사드립니다.”라고 대답했다.\\n\\u3000“바로 그거야. 그렇게 말했어야지. 아주 좋군!” 재거스 씨가 소리쳤다.\\n\\u3000그리고 나는 이 말도 덧붙인 것으로 기억한다. “그 신사 분 아래에서 즐겁게 수업받겠습니다.”라고.\\n\\u3000“좋아 됐네. 일단은 자네가 여기생활을 정리하는 대로 그의 집으로 들어가는 것이 좋겠네. 자네가 하숙할 채비를 하라고 일러놓겠네. 우선은 그의 아들부터 만나보는 것이 좋겠군. 그 녀석도 아마 런던에 있지. 그래 언제 런던으로 올 수 있겠나?”\\n\\u3000조(매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물. 주인공이 배신하는 인물)는 그때까지 아무런 말없이 우리의 대화를 듣고 있었다. 내가 조를 바라보며 “곧바로 떠날 수 있을 것 같습니다.”라고 재거스 씨에게 대답했다.\\n\\u3000“우선.” 재거스 씨가 말했다. “런던으로 올 때 새 옷을 몇 벌 사가지고 오게. 물론 작업복들은 안 되네. 이번 주 내로 자네가 온다고 말해 놓겠네. 돈이 필요하겠지, 일단은 50만 원짜리 수표 20장을 두고 가겠네? 그 정도면  되겠지?”\\n\\u3000나는 간담이 서늘해졌다. 그가 정말 내게 그 돈을 주었기 때문이다.  그가 많은 돈이 든 지갑을 꺼내더니 수표를 한 장 한 장 세며 테이블 위에 수표를 내려놓기 시작했다. 20장을 마저 채운 후 수표를 내게 밀 어주었다.\\n\\u3000수표 20장을 테이블 위에 내려놓은 것이 그가 자기 다리를 의자에서 치운 후 첫 번째로 한 행동이었다. 돈을 내게 넘겨준 후 그가 의자에 걸터앉았다. 물론 그냥 앉기만 했던 것이 아니었다. ‘이젠 당신 차례로’라는 눈빛을 보이며 조(주인공의 순진한 매형)를 쳐다보고 있었다. 그러면서 자신의 두둑한 돈지갑을 조에게 흔들어 보이고 있었다.\\n“자 보시오, 조 가저리? 말이 안 나올 정도로 깜짝 놀랍지 않소?” “그렇군요!  놀랍습니다.”  조가  단단히  결심을  굳히며  대답했다. “이쯤  되면  제게  뭔가  하실  말씀이  있으실  텐데.  그렇지  않소? 이\\n지갑을 보시고도 할 말이 없다면야 말 다했지. 우리 체면일랑은 접어  두고  허심탄회하게 대화합시다.”\\n\\u3000“저도 눈이 있습니다.” 조가 말했다. “눈 있습니다, 저도. 앞으로도 저한테 이 두 눈은 있을 거고요.”\\n\\u3000“예? 눈이 뭐요? 이 보시오.” 재거스 씨가 자신의 두둑한 지갑을 흔들어 보이며 말했다. “내가 받은 임무 중에는 당신에게 적절한 대가를 지불하라는 지시도 있었소, 보상  말이오?”\\n“제가 왜 돈을 받아야 합니까?” 조가 경고조로 말했다.\\n\\u3000“저 애의 도제계약을 해지해 주었지 않소? 도제계약이  중도에 해지 되면 당신도 손실을 볼 것 아니오.”\\n\\u3000조(매형, 대장장이)는 여자가 어깨를 만지듯이 내 어깨에 손을 얹어 놓았다.\\n\\u3000이후로도 난 그때 일을 종종 생각하곤 했다. 어떻게 그와 같은 험한  일을 하는 사람의 손길이 그렇게도 다정할 수 있었는지. 어떻게 건장한 남성 하나쯤은 거뜬히 때려눕힐 수도 있었던 그 사나이의 주먹에 애정을 담아 계란 껍데기 한 조각을 쓰다듬을 수 있는 부드러움이 들 어있을 수 있었는지. 그의 손은 강함과 부드러움을 함께 가진 증기 해 머와 같았다.\\n\\u3000“핍(주인공이름)은 언제든지 따뜻한 환영을 받을 겁니다.” 조가 말했다. “핍(주인공이름)은 명예와 행운을 찾아 대장간 일을 그만둘 수 있습니다. 말이 필요 없는 사실 아닙니까. 하지만 당신이 정녕 그렇게도 돈이 저 어린 것을 잃는 것에 대한 제 보상이라고 우기신다면 그리고 대장장이가 되었을 수도 있는 저 애가 그러니까 내 말은 그러니까 내 절친한 친구를 잃는 것에 대한 보상으로 내가 돈을 바랄 거라는… 그 러니까 당신은… 지금  나를….”\\n\\u3000오! 내 친애하는 조(매형), 나는 그렇게도 그를 떠날 준비만을 했건만 그토록 나는 그를 고맙게 여기지 않았건만…. 나는 조를 다시 보게 되었다.\\n\\u3000그리고  지금 이 글을 쓰는 오늘도 그의  모습이 떠오른다. 울퉁불퉁한 근육질의, 대장장이의 팔뚝으로 두 눈을 가린  채 울먹이고  있던  조의 다정한 모습을. 당신의 넓은 가슴이 떨리는 목소리에 겨워 들어 오르든 모습을.\\n\\u3000오! 내 충직하고 부드러운 조, 내 팔을 손에 쥐고서 떨고 있던 당신의 사랑이 지금 다시 느껴집니다. 저는 오늘 엄숙하리만큼 애절하게도 천사의 날개 짓처럼 바삭바삭 떨고 있던 당신 손의 떨림을 기억합니다.\\n\\n(옮긴이 코멘트 : 내가 내 입으로 이런 말 하면 안 되는 줄 알지만, 너무 좋은 소설임. 위대한 유산...ㅜ_ㅜ)\\n\\n\\u3000하지만 그때 나는 그것이 사랑인지 알지 못했다. 그때 나는 다만 조 (매형)를 부추기고 있었다. 어마어마한 부자가 된다는 생각에 당혹해서 그때 나는 제정신이 아니었다. 그래서 조와 내가 밟아 왔던 부차적인 추억들을 더 거슬러 올라가보고 말고 할 겨를이 없었다.\\n\\u3000나는 조에게 그만 진정하라고 말하고 있었다. 나는 이렇게 말했을 것이다. “조, 조 말대로 우린 언제나 최고의 친구잖아 그럼 앞으로도 최고의 친구인 거  아냐.”\\n\\u3000조가 소매가 없던 손목으로 두 눈에서 눈물을 퍼냈다(닦았다). 용접이 잘못된 곳을 통째로 파내듯이 조는 자신을 파내버리려는 듯 손목으로 사정없이 자신의 두 눈을 닦았다(보기 안 좋았다는 뉘앙스가 있는 문장임). 그리곤 더 이상 아무 말도 하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000재거스 씨(런던의 유명한  변호사)는  그때까지  수수방관하면서 우리의 행동을 구경하고 있었다. 그는 이제 조(주인공의 매형)를 마을의 바보쯤으로 생각하는 표정이었다. 그리고 내가 조의 보호자는 아닌지 의 심하기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000조의 울먹임이 끝나자, 재거스 씨가 지갑 흔들기를 멈추었다. 재거스 씨가 자기 손에 든 지갑의 무게를 느끼며 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“자, 요셉 가저리(요셉은 ‘조’의 세례명). 나는 다시 한 번 더 말해둘 수밖에 없소만. 이게 마지막 기회요. 더 이상 나를 시험에 들게 하지 마시오. 만약 당신이, 당신이 응당 차지해야하는 대가에 대해 받을 용의가 있다면 말하시오. 원하는 만큼 줄 테니. 단 당신이 정녕 그 반대의 경우라고 말할  거면….”\\n\\u3000이 부분에서 재거스 씨는 크게 당황해 말을 멈추고 말았다. 조가 권 투시합에서 사람을 쓰러뜨리듯이 재거스 씨를 의자채로 확 돌려버렸기 때문이다. 그리곤 너를 넉다운 시켜버리겠다는 모든 자세를 취하며 덤벼들려고 하고 있었기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000“내가 말하려는 것은,” 조가 소리쳤다. “만약 당신이 내 집에서 나를 소곯리기(개를 부추겨 황소를 성나게 하는 영국 옛날 놀이. 출처 : 네 이버영어사전)하고 내 집에서 내 목을 졸라 죽이려는 심산이라면 당장 내 집에서 나가란  말이오!  내  말의  의미는  당신도  남자라면 나랑 한 판 붙어보자는 거요 자 덤비시오 당당하게! 내 말의 의미는 나는 내가 말한 것에 대해서는 목숨 걸고 끝까지 지킨다는 것이오! 자 덤비시오!” 나는 조를 재거스 씨(런던의 유명한 변호사)에게서 떼어놓으며 말렸고 조도 금방 유순해졌다. 조가 나를 보며 말했다. 친절한 말투였고 공손하며 타이르는 훈계조의 말투였다. 분명 이 사태를 촉발시킨 재거스\\n씨에게 하는 소리였다. 조가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“난 내 집에서 소곯리기 당하고 목이 졸려 죽고 싶지 않았을 뿐이었소.”\\n\\u3000조가 이렇게 나오자 재거스 씨도 자리에서 일어설 수밖에 없었다. 재거스 씨가 주의 분위기를 살피며 뒷걸음질로 부엌문 근처까지 이동 했다. 돌아올 의사가 없음이 분명했다. 그가 부엌문에서 작별인사랍시고 나를 향해 이렇게 말했다. 그의 말을 모두 옮기면 다음과 같다.\\n\\u3000“이거야 원, 핍 씨, 내 생각에 자넨 하루 빨리 여길 벗어나야하네. 그럼 그럴수록 자네에게 더 좋을 걸세. 자넨 신사가 될 예정이지 않은가. 날짜는 다음 주 오늘로 정하지. 그때까지 자네가 머물 하숙집 주소를 등기우편으로 보내주겠네. 런던 ‘시외 전세마차 터미널’(영어단어발 음은 ‘스테이지코치’)로 가게. 거기서 전세마차(택시)를 타면 내 사무실로 바로 올 수 있네. 명심해두게. 난 이번 사안에 대해 전혀 내 의견을 제시하지 않은 것일세. 나는 어떤 식으로든 내 의견을 이런 식으로든 저런 식으로든 내비친 적이 없네. 알겠는가? 난  어디까지 내가  의뢰받  은 임무만 완수했을 뿐이네. 난 돈을 받았고 의뢰인의 지시대로 했을 뿐이네. 내가 이번 상속건과 아무런  상관관계가  없음을  명심하겠지? 꼭 명심해야하네.”\\n\\u3000그(재거스 씨)가 우리 두 사람(조와 주인공)을 향해 자신의 집게손가 락을 집어던졌다. 그는 그런 자세로 있다가 조(주인공의 매형)가 아무래도 위험인물이란 생각이 들었는지 그 자리(부엌문)를 떠버렸다. 나는 그가 우리를 손가락으로 지목하며 계속 있을 줄 알았다. 하지만 그는 가버렸다.\\n\\u3000그때 내 머릿속에 퍼떡 떠오르는 게 있었다. 나는 뒤쫓아 갔다. 그가 “세 명의 쾌활한 바지선 선원들”(마을 술집이름)로  내려가고 있었다. 술집 앞에 그를 태우고 갈 전세마차(택시)가 대기하고 있었다.\\n“잠시 만요, 잠시 만요 재거스 씨.”\\n\\u3000“오호! 이게 누구신가 핍 씨 아닌가!” 재거스 씨가 되돌아보며 말했다. “그래 무슨  일인가?”\\n\\u3000“저는 이제부터 재거스 씨가 말씀하시는 대로만 하려고요. 그래서 말인데, 제가 여길 떠나기 전에 주위 분들에게 제가 여길 떠나게 되었다고 알리는 것에 대해 아무런 반대의견이 없으신지요? 아무래도 먼저 여쭤보고 행동하는 것이 좋을 것 같아서요.”\\n\\u3000“전혀 없네, 핍군.” 그가 나를 쳐다보며 말했다. 하지만 내가 묻는 말을 제대로 듣지 못한  표정이었다.\\n\\u3000“제가 말씀드린 주위 분들이란 읍 외곽에 계신 분(미스 해비샴)도 포함됩니다.”\\n\\u3000“그렇게 하게, 핍 군.” 그가 이번에도 내 말을 못 들은 게 분명했다.  그가 말했다. “나는 그것에 대해 전혀 반대의견이 없네.”\\n\\u3000나는 그(재거스 씨)에게 고마움을 표시한 후 집으로 다시 뛰어갔다. 집 정문은 이미 조가 잠가놓은 상태였다. 응접실도 비워있었다. 조(매 형)는 다만 부엌 벽난로 옆에 앉아 양 무릎에 손을 얹어놓은 채 멍하니 하지만 뭔가를 골똘히 생각하면서 불타오르고 있는 석탄들을 뚫어지게  바라보고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나도 역시 벽난로 앞에 앉았다. 나는 타오르는 석탄들을 바라보며 오랫동안 참 오랫동안 아무 말없이 그대로 앉아 있었다.\\n\\u3000부엌 한쪽 편엔 내 누나(주인공과 20살차이)가 쿠션방석이 있는 의자 위에 앉아 있었다. 비디는 벽난로 앞에 앉아 자기 몫의 바느질을 하고 있었다. 평화로웠다. 그러니까 내 누나가 앉아 있는 의자 반대쪽 편에 내가 앉아 있었고, 내 바로 옆에 조가 앉아 있었으며, 조 옆에는 비디가 평화롭게 앉아 바느질을 하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 내 마음은 부끄러웠고, 내가 작열하고 있는 석탄들(벽난로 안의 석탁)을 쳐다보면 쳐다볼수록 나는 점점 더 내가 부끄러워져 조를 쳐다볼 용기가 나지 않았다. 이 침묵이 오래가면 갈수록 내가 조에게  말을 걸 수도 없을 정도로 내 자신이 부끄러워질 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000오랜 침묵이 흐른 후 내가 간신히 말을 꺼냈다. “조(주인공의 매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물), 비디한테 얘기했어?”\\n\\u3000“아니다, 핍(주인공이름).” 조가 대답했다. 그는 여전히 벽난로를 쳐 다보며 있었다. 이 짧은 대답을 할 때에도 두 무릎을 쥐고 있던 손의 힘을 빼지 않았다. 마치 자신의 두 무릎이 어딘가로 급히 달아날 작정을 했다는 비밀정보를 얻었다는 태도였다. “아무래도 네가 직접 말해주는 게 좋을 것 같다.”\\n“난 조가 말해주면 더 좋겠는데….”\\n\\u3000“핍은 조만간 재산을 많이 가진 신사가 될 것이야.” 조가 입을 열었다. “하느님, 저 애에게 신의 가호를 내리소서! 아멘.”\\n\\u3000비디가 바느질감을 딱하고 떨어뜨렸다. 비디가 나를 쳐다보았다. 조도 두 손으로 무릎을 꼭 쥔 자세로 나를 쳐다보았다. 나도 두 사람을 쳐다보았다.\\n\\u3000잠시 후 그들이 진심에서 우러나온 따뜻한 축복의 말을 들려주었다. 하지만 그들의 그 축복의 말 안에는 어떤 슬픔의 흔적 같은 것이 있었다. 그게 나를 다소 분개하게 만들었다.(←이런  배은망덕한  놈 -_-;; 가족 버리고 잘 되는 놈 못 봤다. 어디 얼마나 잘 되는지 소설 끝까지 가보자)\\n나는 비디(여자이름)에게 단단히  일러두는  것을  잊지  않았다. “상속인이  누구인지에  대해  어떤  말도  해선  안  돼.  알려고 해서도\\n안 된데. 그게 상속인의  요구사항이니까. 이  조항엔 비디와 조(주인공의  매형)도 포함돼.”라고.\\n나는 비디에게 이 사실을 조에게 잘 설명해주라고 일렀다. 내가 신신당부했다.\\n\\u3000“이름이 밝혀지지 않은 후원자로부터 내가 큰 재산을 물려받게 되었다는 것 빼곤 어떤 다른 말도 해선 안 돼. 때가 되면 후원자가 찾아온데.”\\n\\u3000비디는 사려 깊은 표정이었다. 비디가 벽난로 쪽을 바라보며 조용히 고개를 끄떡여보였다. 비디가 바닥에 떨어져 있던 그녀의 바느질감을 다시 주워들었다. 그녀가  말했다.\\n“응 정말 조심할게,  핍.”\\n조는 그때까지도 계속해서 두 손으로 두 무릎을 붙들고 있었다. 조가 말했다.\\n“그럼아, 핍, 나도 정말로 조심하마.”\\n\\u3000내 말이 끝나자 그들(비디와 조)이 다시 한 번 내게 “너무너무 축하해 핍”이라며 좋아해주었다. “네가 이제부터 신사가 된다니 너무 놀라워.” 그들의 칭찬엔 과한 데가 있었다. 왠지 그것이 나를 반쯤 슬프게 했다.\\n\\u3000그러더니 비디(여자이름)는 방금 일어난 경사에 대해 내 누나에게 조금이라도 의미를 전달하기 위해 무진장 애를 썼다.\\n하지만 내가 믿는 한 비디의 노력은 모두 실패했다.\\n\\u3000누나(악당에게 뒷머리를 심하게 강타당한 후 뇌성마비 증세를 점점 심하게 보이고 있는 누나. 시력과 청력 모두 손상)는 이따금씩 “알아 다”며 고개를 끄덕이기도 하고 비디를 쳐다 보며 웃어 보이기도 했으며 비디의 설명이 끝날 때면 “그래, 핍이? 그래 재산이?” 등등의 단어들을 내뱉었지만 그녀 자신은 실상 자신이 무슨 말을 하고 있는지 몰랐다.\\n\\u3000나는 ‘누나가 지금 하는 말들이 선거 때의 외침보다 더 큰 의미가 있을까?’라는 의문이 들기 시작했다. 그건 단지 현재 누나의 ‘정신상태 상’(불안에 따른 행동)을 보여주는 어두운 단면들 하나에 지나지 않은 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000나는 알 수  없었다. 이후 아마 그 일이 실제 내게 벌어지지  않았다면 나는 믿으려고도 하지 않았을 것이다. 조와 비디는 쉽게 예전의 쾌활한 모습을 되찾아 가고 있었다. 그들이 그러면 그럴수록 나는 점점 더 우울해져만 가고  있었다.\\n\\u3000물론 나에게 일어난 막대한 재산에 대해 내게 무슨 불만이 있었던 것은 아니었다. 다만 내가 내 자신 안의 어떤 부분에 대해 불만을 품기 시작한 것이 분명했다. 그것이 무엇인지 확실치 않을 뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000하여간, 나는 “팔꿈치를 무릎 위에 대고” “손에 얼굴을 괸 채” 벽난로를 보며 앉아 있었다. 두 사람(비디와 조)은 나를 어떻게 떠날 보낼 지(송별회)에 대해 환담을 나누고 있었다. 그리고 내가 가 버리고 나면 그들이 어떻게 지낼지에 대해서도 대화를 나누고  있었다.  그들은  그 밖에 모든 것에 대해 대화를 나누고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그들 둘 중 한 사람의 눈이 나를 바라보고 있는 것이 너무 자주 느껴졌다. 비록 그들이 대단히 유쾌하고 즐거운 표정으로 나를 축복하기 위해 바라보았겠지만. 하지만 그들은 너무 자주 나를 쳐다보았고 특히 비디가 더욱 그러했다. 그것이 나를 좀 기분 상하게 했다. 왠지  나를  너무 자주 쳐다보는 것이 나에 대한 그들의 불신을 확인했다는 태도인 양 느껴졌기 때문이다. 비록 그들이 말로든 생각으로든 추호도 그런 생각을 할 리 만무하다는 것을 하느님도 아시겠지만.\\n\\u3000그럴 때면 난 일어나 마당으로 나가보곤 했다. 우리 집 부엌문은 밤에 열어놓았다. 여름날 저녁의 환기를 위해서였다.\\n\\u3000내가 고개를 들었을 때 여름날의 수많은 별들이 내 안으로 쏟아져 내려오고 있었다.\\n이런  생각이 들었다.\\n\\u3000‘저 별들도 이제까지의 내 삶과 함께 해온 수많은 시골 물건들 중 하나다. 반짝이고 있을 뿐 그저 초라하고 볼품없는 별들일 뿐이야.”라고.\\n\\u3000“토요일 밤이에요.” 우리들이 빵과 치즈 그리고 맥주를 곁들인 야식을 먹기 위해 앉았을 때 내가 한 말이었다. “5일만 더 지나면, 그럼 그 날이 하루 전이니까! 시간은 금방 갈 거야.”\\n\\u3000“그래, 핍.” 조가 의견을 표명했다. 자신의 컵에 담긴 맥주를 꿀꺽꿀꺽 마시며 조가 말했다. “금방 가고말고.”\\n“예, 금방 지나갈 거예요.” 비디가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“조(매형이름), 생각해봤는데 말이야(←나이 차이는 20살 넘게 나지만 서로 반말하는 편안한 친구사이임). 월요일에  읍내로 가서  새 옷을  몇 벌 주문할 때 말이야, 재봉사 아저씨에게 내가 양복점으로 나중에  다시 와서 가지고 가든지, 아니면 재봉사 아저씨가 옷을 처음부터 펌 블추크 씨(능청맞은 곡물상. 잡곡을 도매 및 소매함) 댁으로 보내주면 놓겠다고 말할 생각이야. 그럼 여기서 사람들이 모두 지켜보는 가운데 새 옷을 입을 필요도 없고. 그런 일은 마음에 내키지 않는다고.”\\n\\u3000“하지만 허블 씨(마차수레바퀴 제조인) 내외는 네가 번지러한 양복을 빼입은 모습을 보고 싶어 할 텐데, 핍.” 조가 왼쪽 손바닥 안에 치즈가 듬뿍 발린 빵을 부지런히 자르며, 그리고 내가 입에도 대지 않고 놓아둔 내 야식을 비스듬히 바라다보며 말했다. 우리가 빵을 자른 후 서로의 빵의 크기를 비교해보며 한 입씩 베어 물던 지난날을 떠올려 보는  것 같았다.\\n\\u3000“웹슬 씨(연극배우를 꿈꾸는 교회서기)도 네가 양복 입은 모습을 보고 싶어 할 텐데. 더군다나 네가 양복입고 ‘세 명의 쾌활한 바지선 선 원들’(마을 술집이름)에 등장하면 환호서을 받을 텐데.”\\n\\u3000“난 그게 싫다고. 나로 인해 떠들썩해지는 게 싫어. 변변찮고 천한 옷 한 벌에 생난리를 피워야 되겠어, 응!”\\n\\u3000“아, 설마하니…, 핍!” 조가 말했다. “하지만 네가 정 그렇게 싫다면야 어쩔….”\\n\\u3000이 부분에서 비디(여자이름)가 내게 물었다. 그때 비디는 내 누나의 음식수발을  들어주고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“가저리 씨(주인공의 매형)에겐 양복 입은 네 모습을 보여줄 테지? 그리고 네 누나와 나에게도 보여주지 않겠니? 우리들에겐 보여줄 수 있잖니?”\\n\\u3000“비디.” 내가 다소 화가 나서 되받아치며 말했다. “비디, 넌 뭐든지  너무 앞서 나가는 버릇이 있어. 내가 보조를 맞추기도 어렵다고.”\\n\\u3000“그녀는 무엇이든 빠르지.” 조(주인공의 매형)도 자신의 의견을 제시했다.\\n\\u3000“만약 네(비디)가 조금만 더 기다렸더라면, 비디, 넌 내가 이렇게 말 하는 것을 들을 수 있었을 거야. ‘아마도 내가 떠나는 바로 전날 저녁이 되겠죠, 내가 내 새 양복들을 여기로 한 보따리 가지고 올께.’란 말을 말이야.”\\n\\u3000비디(여자이름)가 더 이상 아무 말도 하지 않았다. 나는 곧 비디에게 상냥하게 대해준 후, 비디와 조(주인공의 매형)와 함께 “굿 나잇” 인사를 나눈 후 내 침실이 있는 다락방으로 올라갔다.\\n\\u3000내게 이젠 다소 작은 방이었다. 잠시 동안 주위를 둘러보며 앉아 있었다. 내가 곧 신분상승을 하게 되면 영원히 이별할, 이젠 정말로 영원히 안 봐도 될, 뒤떨어지고 볼품없는 조그마한 방이었다.\\n\\u3000물론 산뜻한 어린 시절의 추억들도 장식되어 있는 방이었다. 심지어 이 생각을 하는 순간까지도 나는 “내 초라한 현재의 다락방”과 그리고 “내가 곧 살게 될 새로운 하숙집”사이에서 혼란스럽고 분명치 않은 감정을 느끼고 있었다. 그것은 내가 “대장간”과 “미스 해비샴의 저택” 사이에서 자주 경험하던 감정들이었다. 그것은 또한 내가 비디(평범하지만 아주 착한 여자)와 에스텔라(부유하고 아름답고 성격 아주 안 좋은 여자)사이에서 종종 경험해오던 혼란스럽고 분명치 않은 감정이었다.\\n\\u3000태양이 하루 온종일 내 다락방 지붕 위를 밝게 비추던 날이었던지라 방은 밤인데도 더웠다. 나는 창문을 밀어서 연 후 밖을 내다보며 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000아래층에선 어두운 문을 향해 천천히 이동하고 있는 조(주인공의 매형)의 모습이 보였다. 밤공기를 마시며  한 두 차례  산책을  하고 있었다. 그때 비디(여자이름)가 조에게 다가와 파이프를 가져다준 후 불을 붙여주었다.\\n\\u3000조는 절대 그런 늦은 시각에 담배를 피우지 않았다. 그래서 그의 행동이 나에게 조가 어떤 이유에서인지 또는 다른 이유에서인지 위로를  받고 싶어 한다는 사실을 암시하는 듯했다.\\n\\u3000조(매형)가 내 다락방 아래에 있는 문에 서서 이내 파이프(담배)를 피우기 시작했다. 비디(여자이름)는 그의 옆에서 조용히 얘기를 하고 있었다. 나도 알 수 있었다. 그들은 지금 내 얘기를 정겹게 하고 있다. 애정이 듬뿍 담긴 어조로 내 이름이 몇 번이고 언급되는 것을 들을 수 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000굳이 들으려고 했었다면 더 들었을 것이다. 하지만 더 듣지 않았다. 창문을 떠나 내 자리로 돌아온 나는 침대 맡에 있던 내 의자에 앉고 말았다. 내일부터 휘황찬란하게 펼쳐질 내 밝은 미래들을 맞이할 첫날 밤의 풍경치고는 너무 낯설고 너무 외로웠기  때문이다.  이  외로움은 내가 일찍이 경험해보지 못한 것이었다. 신분상승을 하게 된 이때 이런 감정을 느끼리라곤 상상도 해본 적이 없었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000나는 열린 창문 쪽을 향해 앉아 있었다. 창문가에서 조가 뿜어댄 것 같은 화환(동그라미) 모양의 연기들이 보였다. 그 옅은 색의 화환들은 조가 내게 보낸 축복의 꽃다발일 것이다. 내 주변의 사람들은 그렇게 나에게 강요하지도 그렇다고 내 앞에 끼어들지도 않으며, 단지 우리가 함께 나누는 여름밤의 공기 속으로 축복의 꽃다발을 널리 퍼뜨리고 있 었다.\\n\\u3000촛불을 끈 후 잠자리에 들었다. 늘 자던 침대가 왜 그렇게 낯설고 불편한지. 왜 내가 그토록 잠을 이룰 수 없었던지.\\n\\u3000나는 이제 내 침대에서 더 이상 편안하게 잠을 잘 수 없었던 것이다. 절대로 그리고  앞으로도….\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 19장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000아침이 되자 나는 다시 앞으로 내 앞에 전개될 미래에 대해 기대만 빵하게 되었다. 그건 아무리 생각해도 휘황찬란하고 밝은 미래였다. 도대체 어제 내가 침대에 누워 했었던 원인모를 외로움과는 사뭇 다른 종류의 감정이었다.\\n\\u3000그래도 걸리는 것이 하나 있었는데 6일이나 더 이곳에 있어야지만 내가 여길 떠날 수 있다는 사실이었다. 내가 런던으로 갈 때 때마침  그 곳에서 뭔가 일이 발생해 예정에서 어긋나거나 아예 일이 틀어져버 리거나 혹은 이 모든 일들이 아예 없었던 일이 될 수도 있었기 때문이 었다.\\n\\u3000내가 다가오고 있는 우리의 헤어짐에 대해 얘기를 했을 때, 조(주인 공의 매형)와 비디(여자이름)는 아주  동정적이었다.  밝은  표정들이었 다. 하지만 내가 이별 얘기를 꺼내기 전에는 절대 그들이 먼저 그 얘기를  말하는  경우란 없었다.\\n\\u3000아침식사가 끝난 후 조가 응접실에 있는 장롱에서 내 수습공계약서를 가지고 나왔다. 우리는 그것을 함께 불 속에 집어넣었고 나는 이제 자유의 몸이었다.\\n\\u3000계약에서 해방된 것에 대한 새로움과 신기함 그리고 참신함을 듬뿍 안고서 나는 조와 교회로 예배 보러 나갔다.\\n\\u3000예배시간동안 나는 이런 생각이 들었다. ‘아마 어제 나에게서 일어난 행운에 대해 목사님께서 들어섰더라면 목사님께서 〈 부자와 가난한  사람 그리고 천국 〉에 관한 말씀을 하시지 않았을  건데’라고.\\n\\u3000잘 차려진 점심식사를 끝낸 후 나는 혼자 산책을 나갔다. 산책도 하고 동시에 늪지대를 마지막으로 둘러보며 이제까지의 일들(죄수에게 빵과 포도주을 건네준 것)을 청산해볼 겸 간 산책이었다.\\n\\u3000교회(늪지대입구)를 지날 때 나는 느꼈다. 태어나서  죽을 때까지 매주 일요일이 되면 이 곳에 와야 했던 그들, 결국에는 저 녹색의 낮고 오래된 무덤들 사이 어딘가의 애매모호한 위치에 눕혀지게 될 숙명을 지니고 살아가야 하는 이 가난하고 초라한 빈민들의 삶에 대해 측은한 마음을 들어 숭고하다는 생각이 들었다. 이 감정은 오늘 아침 예배시 간에도  느낀 것이었다.\\n나는 내 스스로에게 다음과 같이 약속했다.\\n\\u3000‘조만간 마을 사람들을 위해 무언가 해주리라. 로스트 비프(소고기 구이)와, 건포도 넣은 푸딩과, 에일(영국의 쓴  맥주)  500cc(오백시시) 와, 4.5ℓ(리터) 맥주 통에 가득 담긴 내 겸손과 함께 우리 마을 모든 사람들에게 거뜬한 저녁식사 한 끼씩을 대접해주리라.’\\n그리고 그 개략적인 실천계획들을 마음속으로 그려보았다. \\n\\u3000내 어린 시절에 중죄인의 표식을 단채 다리에 쇠사슬을 차고서 추위에 지치고 불행에 짓눌려 누더기가 된 몸으로 저 무덤들 사이로 저벅저벅 걸어가던 내 죄수의 모습을 본 것도 바로 여기 이 교회무덤에서였다.\\n\\u3000이후 그가 생각날 때면 수치심을 동반한 어떤 몹쓸 감정이 나를 덮쳐 치가 떨리던 것도 저 교회무덤에서였다.\\n\\u3000지금 그에 대한 기억을 다시 생각나게 한 것도 이 일요일 날의 교회 무덤들이었다. 그가 다시  생각나다니!\\n\\u3000하지만 그건 아주 오래 전 일이었다. 더구나 그 죄수는 분명 아주  먼 섬(영국 사형수 유배장소 〓 오스트레일리아)으로 유배 보내졌을 것이고 어쩌면 이미 진짜로 죽은 사람인지도 모른다. 어쨌든 그는 내게 있어 이미 죽은 사람인 것은 분명했다. 그것이 그나마 나를 위로했다.\\n\\u3000이제 낮고 젖은 이 땅도 더 이상 내 기억 속에서 안녕이었다. 이제 방들과 저 둑들과도 이젠 안녕이고, 목초지 위에서 풀을 뜯고 있는가 축들도 안녕이었다. 비록 그들이 이젠 나를 보다 존중하는 태도로 보다 칙칙한 색깔을 한 채 그 자리에 서서, 막대한 유산을 상속받게 된  나를 향해 최대한의 존경을 드러내기 위해 나를 돌아보려고 얼굴을 돌 리려는 것 같았지만  말이다.\\n\\u3000“단조로운 내 어린 시절의 교우 관계도 이젠 작별인 것이다.” 지금 부터는 런던으로 간다. 그 곳에서 출세할 일만 남았다.\\n\\u3000이런 대장장이 생활과도 이별이며 이젠 정말 이들 모든 것들과 작별이었다.\\n나는 혼자 기뻐 날뛰면서 ‘오래된 포대’(포병부대가 버리고 간 시설물)까지 갔다. 거기서 다음과 같은 생각을 하며 누워 쉬고 있었다.\\n\\u3000‘이 모든 것이 나를 에스텔라의 짝으로 삼으려는 미스 해비샴의  의도가 아닐까? 왜 내게 재산을 물려주려는 것일까?’라는 생각.\\n그러다 나는 문득 잠이 들고 말았다. \\n\\u3000잠에서 깨어났을 때 옆에서 파이프(담배)를 피우며 앉아 있는 조(주 인공의 매형)를 발견하곤 많이 놀랐다. 내가 눈을 뜬 것을 확인하자 조가 다정한 미소로  맞아주었다.\\n그가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“너와 함께 여길 와 보는 것도 이젠 마지막이 될 것 같아서, 따라와 봤다.”\\n“따라와 줘서 고마워,  조.”\\n“그렇게 말해주니 내가 더 고맙구나, 핍ㅋㅋ.”\\n\\u3000“정말 착한 조.” 서로 악수를 나눈 후 내가 말했다. “내가 절대로 조를 잊지 않을 것임을 확신하지 응?”\\n\\u3000“그래 핍 나도 그렇게 생각한단다.” 조가 편안한 어조로 말했다. 하지만 내  기대엔 못 미치는 다음과 같은 말을 하는 것도  잊지 않았다.  “암 확신하고말고. 넌 그럴 애니까. 아하, 아하, 여보시게들! 하느님이 축복주시길. 어떤 것에 대해 확신하는 것은 그 사람의 마음속에서 그것이 반듯하게 받아들이기만 하면 되니까. 하지만 이렇게 갑작스럽게 터진 돌발사태에 대해선 익숙해지는데 시간이 좀 필요하지 않겠니?  핍.”\\n\\u3000웬일일까? 나는 조가 내 확신에 대해 그렇게 힘차게 확신하고 있는  것이 최대한으로까지 기뻐지는 않았다. 나는 “내가 절대 조를 잊지 않을 것임을 확신하지?”란  내 물음에 그가 감정을 드러내며  옹호해주거나 아니면 “널 믿고말고, 핍.”이라거나 아니면 그런 종류의 몸짓을 취해줄  줄 알았었다.\\n\\u3000따라서 조금 불편해진 난 조가 말한 ‘첫 번째 주제’(모든 건 사람마음 먹기 나름이다)에 대해서는 일절 언급하지 않고 ‘두 번째 주제’(변화를 받아들이는 데에는 시간이 필요하다)에 대해서만 다음과 같이 언급했다.\\n\\u3000“정말 갑자기 찾아온 소식이야, 하지만 난 항상  신사가  되고 싶어 했어, 종종 아주 종종 이런 상상을 했다고. 만약 내가 신사라면 무엇을 할지에 대해 심사숙고해왔었다고. 조가 생각하는 것보다 훨씬 자주 말 이야.”\\n\\u3000“그런 생각들을 했었니?” 조(주인공의 매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물)가 말했다.  “놀랍구나!”\\n\\u3000“하지만 지금은 좀 속상해.” 내가 말했다. “우리가 여기서 좀 더 공부를 계속 할 수 있었더라면 조가 좀 더 발전할 수 있었을 텐데 말이야,  안 그래?”\\n\\u3000“글쎄다, 난 모르겠는데.” 조가 대꾸했다. “난 태어날 때부터 아둔했 단다. 난 그냥 대장장이 일이 천직이지. 나도 내가 끔찍스러울 정도로 바보란 것에 대해 항상 유감으로 생각하고 있단다. 하지만 뭐, 그런다고 내가 1년 전 오늘 보다 덜 바보가 되는 것도 아니니까. 그렇게 생각  안하니, 핍?”\\n\\u3000내 말의 의미는 그게 아니었다. 나는 내가 재산을 가지게 된 이때  그리고 조를 위해 무언가를 더 해줄 수 있는 이때에, 만약 조가 좀 더  내 도움을 잘 받을 수 있는 선까지 올라와 있었더라면 내가 그를 위해 무엇인가를 해주기가 훨씬 더 수월했을 거라는 의미였다.\\n\\u3000그는 내 말의 의미를 완전히 오해할 만큼 너무나 순진무결한 사람이었다. 그래서 난 차라리 이 얘기(조에게 시간 나는 대로 글자공부를 시킬 것)를 비디(여자이름)에게 해두는 게 낫겠다는 생각했다.\\n\\u3000우리가 다시 집으로 돌아와 차를 마시고 난 후, 나는 비디를 좁은 길가 옆에 있는 우리만의 자그마한 정원 안으로 끌어들였다. 그녀의 기분을 좋게 해주기 위해 “내가 너를 절대 잊지 않을 거야”란 감언이설을 내뱉은 후 내가 그녀에게 “부탁할 게 한 가지 있는데…”라며 얘기를 꺼냈다.\\n\\n(위대한 유산 하루 평균 블로그 조회 수가 세 명이야 응 어쩔?  ㅜ_ㅠ)\\n\\n\\u3000“비디(여자이름), 있잖아.” 내가 말했다. “조금씩이라도 좋으니까 내가 없는 동안에도 네가 조를 공부시켜 주었으면 좋겠어. 읽고 쓰기 정도는 가리킬 수  있잖니.”\\n\\u3000“어떻게 그를  도우라는 거니?” 비디가 꾸준히 나를 훑어보며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“글쎄! 조가 착한 건 사실이지만, 물론 이 세상에서 가장 착한게 사 실이지만 어떤 분야에 있어선 약간 뒤쳐진 것도 사실이잖니. 예를 들자면, 학습이라든지 매너(신사의  예의범절)라든지.”\\n\\u3000아무리 내가 그녀를 보면 얘기를 꺼냈을 지라도, 그리고 내가  얘기하는 동안 그녀가 눈을 아주 크게 뜨고 있었을지라도, 그녀는 이제 나를 더 이상 쳐다보고 있지 않았다.\\n\\u3000“아, 매너라고! 그에게 매너를 가르치라고? 그럼 그의 매너가 좋지 않다는 거니?” 비디가 ‘까막까치밥나무’(열매로 잼을 만든다고 하네요,  첨 들어봤음-_-;; 이 문화적 수준이란~ 네이버검색참조) 이파리 하나를  잡아당기며 말했다.\\n“그래 비디, 여기서야 통할지  몰라도….”\\n\\u3000“아! 여기선 통할지 모른다고…?” 비디가 손에 쥔 이파리를 뚫어지게 바라다보며 내 말을 가로막으며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그래 여기서야 통할지 몰라. 하지만 나는 조를 한 단계 더 발전시키고 싶은 거야. 내가 상속재산을 완전히 물려받게 되면 난 조를 이 시골에서 벗어나게 할 거라고. 하지만 지금 그의 글 읽고 쓰기나 매너 수준으로는 나도 손 쓸 수가 없어.”\\n\\u3000“네가 그렇게 생각하고 있는 것을 그도 알고 있니? 그럼 그도 자신의 문제를 알고 있다고는 생각 안 드니?” 비디가 물었다.\\n\\u3000그 질문은 너무 약 오르고 화가 나는 질문이었다. 왜냐하면 난 추호도 그런 생각(조가 자신의 무지를 알고 있고 노력하고 있다)을 해 본 적이  없었기 때문이다.\\n난 표정이 굳어 다음과 같이 딱딱하게 말했다. “비디, 그게 무슨  말이니?”\\n\\n(옮긴이 : “읽는 사람 없다고 너무 막 번역하는 거 아냐? 성의를 보여줘”)\\n\\n비디(여자이름)가  두  손으로  맞비비며  그  잎을  조각조각  냈다. 그리고  까막까치밥나무(열매로  잼  만듦)  관목  숲은  그  이후로 나로\\n하여금 개울가 옆 조그마한 정원 안에 있었던 비디와 나 사이의 그 날 저녁의 대화를 떠오르게 하곤 한다.\\n비디가 말했다.\\n“그에게도 자존심이란 것이 있을 거라곤 진지하게 생각 안 해봤니?” “뭐 자존… 뭐?” 내가 아주 화가 나서 경멸조로 말했다.\\n\\u3000“아! 자존심에도 수많은 종류가 있을 수 있어.” 비디가 나를 똑바로 쳐다보며 말했다. 그리곤 고개를 좌우로 흔들며 이런 말도 했다. “자존심에는 한 종류만 있는 것이 아니….”\\n“왜? 왜 말을 끊지?” 내가 쏘아댔다.\\n\\u3000“한 종류만 있는 것이 아냐, 자존심에는.” 비디가 다시 자신의 말을 이어갔다. “그는 자기 자신에 대한 자부심이 대단해서 ‘다른 누군가가’ 현재 자신의 위치에서 최선을 다하고 있는 그를 그리고 실제로도 자신의 역할을 충실히 이행하고 있는 그를 그리고 주변 사람들로부터도 인정을 받고 있는  ‘그를 현재의  위치에서 꺼내는 것을 허락하지  않을 수도 있어.’ 너에게만 솔직히 말하면 나는 그의 자존심이 대단할 거라고  봐. 물론 지금 내가 하는 얘기들은 나보다 그를 더 잘 아는 네게 있어선 대단히 무례한 행동일 순 있어. 하지만 난 자기 자신의 일에 대한  그의  자긍심을 느껴진다고.”\\n\\u3000“비디.” 내가 말했다. “너에게서 그런 말을 듣게 되다니 정말 유감이다. 이런 식으로 너의 진면목을 보게 될 줄이야. 넌 지금 날 질시(샘을 내고 미워하며 쳐다봄)하고 있는 거야. 그래서 그렇게 삐딱하게 말하는 거고. 말해봐, 실은 내 행운이 부러운 거지. 넌 어쩜 애가 그러니.”\\n\\u3000“만약 네가 그렇게 생각하고 싶다면 그렇게 말해도 좋아.” 비디가 되받아치며 말했다. “반복해서 말해도 좋아, 만약 내 행동이 너에게 그런 생각이 들게  했다면.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 넌 그렇게 생각했다는 거니, 비디?” 내가 우쭐해하며 상급자같은 말투로 말했다(비디가 2살이 더  많음.  주인공18세.  비디20세).  “내 탓만 하지 말고 말라는 거니? 비디. 정말 실망이다. 너에게  이런  면이 있을 줄이야. 이건 인간본성의 나쁜 면이야. 나는 그냥 내가 가버린 후 네가 조의 개선(읽고, 쓰기, 매너-예의범절)을 위해 조금 시간을 내줄 수 있느냐고 물으려던 것이었어. 그런데 이런 식으로 네 진짜 모 습을 접하게 될 줄이야. 좋아, 이 시간 이후로 너에게 그 어떤 부탁도  하지 않을 거야. 알겠니? 비디, 정말 실망이다.”\\n내가  되풀이해서 말했다.\\n“이건(시기심) 인간본성의 정말로 나쁜 면이야.” \\n\\u3000“네가 나를 꾸짖던 용서하든.” 불쌍한 비디(여자이름)가 대답했다. “이건 하난 믿어도 좋아. 네가 떠난  후에도 난 여기서 항상  내가 다할  수 있는 모든 일들을 열심히 해낼 거라는 사실을 말이야. 나에 대한 어떤 편견을 가지고 떠나든지 간에 이거 하난 말할 수 있어. 어떤 경우에도 너에 대한 내 기억은 변함이 없을 거야. 하지만 신사라면 자기 자신에게나 남들에게나 똑같은 눈으로 바라볼 줄 알아야해.” 비디가 내게서 고개를 돌리며  말했다.\\n\\u3000나는 다시 한 번 그것(시기심)이 인간 본성의 나쁜 면이라며 열을 올리며 탓한 후, 비디를 떠나 샛길을 통해 내려왔다. 비디는 집으로 다시 돌아갔다.\\n\\u3000나는 정원 문을 나선 후 풀이 완전히 죽은 채 저녁 식사 시간까지 어슬렁거렸다.\\n\\u3000하지만 내가 비디에게 말한 “시기심은 인간 본성의 나쁜 면이야”란  말은 분명 착한 비디에게는 해당이 되지 않지만, 나는 이후 “시기심이 인간 본성의 나쁜 면이다”라는 내 생각이 타당하다는 수많은 사례들을 보여주는 갖가지 인간 군상들을 만나게 된다. 물론 그 어떠한 경우에도 비디에게는 해당이 되지 않는 말이었지만.\\n\\u3000이상한 일이었다. 내 휘황찬란한 미래로 진입하고 있는 이 두 번째 밤조차도 첫 번째 밤(어제)만큼이나 외롭고 성에 차지 않았다. 나는 이   게 너무 슬프고 낯설게 느껴졌다. 이런 감정들은 예전엔 느껴보지 못했던 감정들이었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 다시 아침이 밝았을 때 내 머릿속에서는 휘황찬란한 미래가 펼쳐지고 있었고 나는 다시 또 비디에게도 너그럽게 대할 수 있었다. 그래서 그 주제(너 변했어)에 대한 우리의 앙금은 풀어졌다.\\n\\u3000최고의 신사복을 주문해두기 위해 아침 일찍 읍내로 향했다. ‘이렇게 이른 아침에도 신사복전문점이 문을 열었을까?^^’라며 기대만발하며 내달려갔고 나는 트랩 씨의 신사복전문점 안으로 입성할 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000‘양복장이’인 트랩 씨는 가게 뒤에 있는 응접실에서 아침식사를 하고 있는 중이었다. 그가 나를 안으로 들어오라며 불렀다. 아마도 자신이 나와서 맞이할 만큼의 돈도 뽑을 수 없는 손님이라고 여기는 듯 했다.\\n\\u3000“그래!” 트랩 씨가 속마음은 ‘저 놈 또 왜 왔지?’였겠지만 일단은 겉치레로 친절한 체하며 물었다. “그래 무슨 일이냐, 어떤 걸 찾지?”\\n\\u3000그때 트랩 씨는 세 겹으로 감싸인 두툼한 롤빵을 막 자르고 있었다.  그가 빵 사이로 버터를 미끈하게 쳐 바른 후 살짝 덮는 모습이 보였다.\\n\\u3000트랩 씨는 전도유망한(잘나가는) 노총각이었다. 일부러 결혼을 하지 않고 있었으며 굳게 독신을 지키고 있는 ‘독신주의 노총각’ 뭐 그런 경우였다.\\n\\u3000어찌나 그의 신사복전문점이 번창하든지 그는 가게 벽난로 옆에 있는 벽에다가 비까번쩍한 철제금고를 하나 박아 두었는데, 나는 지금도 확신하기를 ‘그 철제금고 안에는 돈다발이 넝쿨째 굴러다니고 있었을 것이다.’\\n\\u3000“트랩 씨(양복장이).” 내가 말했다. “제 자랑 같아서 말씀을 안 드리려고 했는데 실은 제가 막대한 유산을 받게 되었어요.”\\n\\u3000순간 트랩 씨의 안색이 확 바뀌었다. 뭔가 그의 내면에서 동물적인 장사꾼 기질이 터져 나온 것이다. 그가 이제 버터고 롤빵이고 뭐고 한 쪽으로 제쳐놓은 채 침대 곁(가게 위 응접실이 침대임)에서 벌떡 일어나 식탁보에 자신의 손가락들을 재빨리 닫은 후 저돌적으로 코를 벌렁 거리며 내게 돌진하고  있었다.\\n“오 기어이 하느님의 축복이 자네에게도 내리는구나.” “후원자를 만나기 위해 곧 런던으로 가야 해요.”\\n\\u3000내가 문득 소매에서 수표를 몇 장 꺼내 그것이 50만 원짜리인지 새삼 확인한 후  말했다.\\n\\u3000“그래서 양복을 한 벌 맞출까 해요. 최신 유행으로 해주셨으면 해요. 원하시면 비용은….”\\n\\u3000아무래도 선불 얘기를 안 하면 그가 대충 만드는 시늉만 낼 것 같아서 나는 이렇게 덧붙였다. “원하시면 비용은 선불로 해드릴 깨요. 이미 준비되어 있거든요.”\\n\\u3000“친애하는 핍 선생.” 트랩 씨가 정중하게 허리를 굽혀 인사하는 행동을 취하며 그리고 동시에 자신의 팔을 활짝 벌려 멋대로 내 두 팔꿈치 바깥쪽을 자신에게로 끌어당기며 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그런 식으로 말하지 말게나. 자꾸 그러면 내 마음이 아프잖나. 부디 그런 말은 다시는 하지 말아주게. 어떻게 나 따위라도 감히 자네에게 축하인사를 해도 될까? 우선은 협소하지만 내 가게로 들어와 주는 호의를 베풀어주겠는가?”\\n\\u3000트랩 씨에게는 점원 소년이 한 명 있었다. 그 소년은 이 일대 시골 지방에서 가장 뻔뻔한 녀석이었다. 내가 가게 앞에 나타났을 때 그  소년이 가게 내부 바닥을 쓸고 있었는데 먼지를 내 쪽으로 몰리게 쓸고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 트랩 시와 함께 가게 안으로 들어간 이후에도 녀석은 계속해서 빗자루 질을 해대고 있었는데 가게 온 구석들과 물건들을 가능한 한  많이 부딪혀 가며 소리를 마구 내대며 빗자루 질을 하며, 적어도 자신이 이 세상 어떤 대장장이(주인공, 18세)와도 동급이라는 사실을 나타 내려했다. 적어도 내가 생각하기엔 그랬다. 녀석의 행동으로 보아선 자 신과 비교당하는 그 대장장이가 먼지에 뒤덮여 살든 죽든 상관없는 모양이었다.\\n\\u3000“소리 좀 작작 내 이 녀석아.” 트랩 씨가 점원 소년에게 호통치며 말했다. “안 그랬다간 구석에 처박아 놓을 줄 알아. 자자, 핍 선생 저딴 녀석에겐 신경 쓰지 말고 어서 자 어서 앉게. 자, 그럼 시작해볼까.”\\n\\u3000트랩 씨가 옷감 두루마리 한 롤을 벽장에서 끌어내린 후, 계산대 위로 그 옷감 두루마리를 물 흐르듯이 펼쳐 보인 후, 옷감 두루 마리 밑으로 손을 집어넣어 내가 그 옷감의 윤기를 잘 볼 수 있도록 했다.\\n트랩  씨가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“아주 부드러운 재질이지 않는가. 자네  의도를  완벽하게 충족시키고 도 남을 걸세. 슈퍼 급이지. 어떤가? 왜 싫은가? 걱정 말게. 내  다른  걸로 대령하겠네. 잠시만. 어슬렁거리지 말고 4번 두루마리 가져와!”\\n\\u3000마지막 말은 트랩 씨가 점원 소년을 매우 엄한 눈초리로 째려보며 한 말이었다. 트랩 씨 생각으론 아무래도 이 점원 소년이 나(주인공)를 솔로 칠하는 만행을 저지러거나 아니면 어떤 다른 행동을 취하며 나와의 친밀함을 표시하는 만행을 저지를 수도 있음을 예감했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000점원 소년이 4번 두루마리를 가지고 와 계산대 위에 놓고 내(주인 공)게서 한 참 멀리 떨어질 때까지  트랩 씨(양복장이)는  점원 소년에게서 매서운 눈초리는 때지 않았다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 트랩 씨가 5번 두루마리를 가지고 오라고 지시했다. 그런 다음 트랩 씨가 다시 8번 두루마리를 가지고 오라고 점원 소년에게 지시했다.\\n\\u3000“번호 똑바로 보고 가져와. 꾀부리지 말고.” 트랩 씨가 말했다. “네가 꾀부리면 내가 모를 줄 알지. 호되게 혼날 줄 알아, 이 꼴통 녀석아. 꾀부리면 아주 끝장내 버릴 테니까.”\\n\\u3000그런 다음 트랩 씨는 4번 두루마리 위로 몸을 굽힌 후 아주 정중한 자세로 확신에 차서 그 옷감을 내게 추천해주었다.\\n\\u3000“여름용 옷감이네. 가벼우면서도 시원하지. 귀족들과 신사들 사이에서 최고 인기네. 런던최고 유행품이지. 만약 이렇게 유명한 자네가…, 어떤가? 내가 감히 자네를 나와 같은 동네 사람이라고 불러도 좋겠는가? 그래 고맙네. 만약 이렇게 유명한 자네가 이 옷감으로 만든 내 양복을 입어 준다면 나 같은 ‘같은 동네 사람’에게 있어 더할 나의 없는 영광이 될 걸일세. 잠시만 기다려주게. 이 녀석아(점원소년), 5번 두루 마리랑 8번 두루마리 어서 가져오지 못해!”\\n물론 마지막 말은 트랩 씨가 점원 소년에게 한 말이었다. 트랩 씨가 점원 소년을 보며 마저 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그렇지 않았다간 내 발길에 채여 가게 밖으로 쫓겨날 줄 알아. 아니면 내가 발로 널 가게 밖으로 차버리고 두루마리들을 직접 가져오랴?”\\n\\u3000나는 트랩 씨(양복장이)의 판단력에 의지해서 양복을 맞추기 위한 재료들을 골랐다. 내 몸 치수를 재기 위해 우리는 다시 응접실로 돌아왔다.\\n\\u3000물론 트랩 씨는 내 치수를 가지고 있었지만 웬일인지 다시 재고 싶어 했다. 지금까지 그 치수로도 아주 만족하며 사용해왔음에도 말이다.\\n트랩 씨가 내 치수를 다시 재는 것과 함께 사과조로 이렇게 말했다. “현재의  상황  하에서는  이전  치수는  더  이상  맞지  않을  걸세.” 그래서 트랩 씨가 응접실에서 내 몸치수를 재고 면밀히 다시 계산하\\n게 되었다. 그런데 어찌나 세밀하게 재고 계산을 하시든지 내가 마치 토지(땅)고 그가 이 세상에서 가장 정밀한 측량기사인 것 같이 느껴지는 건 어쩔 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000땀까지 뻘뻘 흘려가며 엄청난 노력을 기울이며 내 몸치수를 재었기 때문에 내가 아무리 비싼 양복을 맞추고 그에게 대가를 지불한다손 치더라도 그가 들인 노고에 대한 충분한 보상이 되지 못할 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000마침내 그가 치수재기를 끝마쳤다. 화요일 저녁에 펌블추크 씨(능청 맞은 잡곡상. 도매 소매  같이 하는 곡물상인) 댁으로 물품들을  보내기로 약속했을 때, 그가 응접실 자물쇠를 손으로 꼭 붙잡으며 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“핍(주인공이름, 18세) 경(귀족), 나도 잘 안다네. 런던의 신사 분께서 이런 시골 신사복전문점의 단골이 되어줄 리가 만무하다는 것을 말 일세. 물론 일반적인 경우엔 그렇다는 말이네. 하지만 만약 자네가 이 따금씩이라도 같은 동네 사람인 내게 자네의 옷을 맞출 수 있는 기회를 준다면, 나는 무한한 영광으로 받아들일 것이네. 이 얼마나 화창한 아침인가.  그래  잘  가게,  핍  경(귀족).  고맙네.  (점원소년에게 고개를 돌리며) 문!”\\n\\u3000물론 “문!”이라고 외친 것은 점원소년(뻔뻔한 소년)을 겨냥해 트랩 씨(양복장이)가 홱 던진 외침이었다. 하지만 점원소년은 트랩 씨가 왜 “문!”이라고 갑자기 외쳤는지 아무 생각이 없었다.\\n\\u3000그보다 나는 자기 주인이 나(대장장이, 18세)를 배웅하면서 옷까지 털어주는 모습을 보고는 맨붕상태(충격)에 빠져 있는 그의 모습을 볼 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000돈의 엄청난 위력에 대한 내  첫 경험은  강렬했다. 뻔뻔한 점원소년이 돈의 위력에 놀라 정신적으로 나자빠지는 모습을 내가 보았기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000이 인상적인 사건을 뒤로 하고, 나는 ‘모자제조인의 가게’와, ‘구두제 조인의 가게’ 그리고 ‘양품점(양말 메리야스 장수의  가게)’에 들렀다. 그때 마다 나는 마치 내가 “모든 직공들의 서비스가 요구되는 의상 한 벌을 입은,” 허버드 아줌마(영국 동요에 나오는 여주인공, 네이버검색 참조)의 “개가 된 기분이  들었다.”\\n\\u3000나는 역마차 매표소에도 들러 토요일 아침 7시 마차 표를 예매했다. 더 이상 내가 가는 곳들에 막대한 유산을 상속받게 되었네 마네 하는 소리를 할 필요가 없었다. 소문은 이미 널리 퍼졌고 내가 어떤 말\\n을 할 때마다 가게 주인들의 서비스는 신속했다.\\n\\u3000읍내 중심가 가게주인들은 평소엔 창문 너머로 보이는 도로와 맞은편 가게에 손님들이 많은지 적은지를 감시하는 것이 일과였는데, 내가 어떤 말을 할 때마다 가게 주인들은 도로고 뭐고 오직 내가 무슨 말을 할 것인지에만 관심을 집중하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000미리 생각해두었던 물품들에 대한 모든 주문 마치고, 나는 펌블추크 씨(능청맞은 잡곡상, 도소매 같이 하는 곡물상인) 댁으로 걸음을 옮겼다. 내가 펌블추크 씨의 영업소에 가까이 왔을 때 때마침 상점 문 앞에서 있는 그가 보였다.\\n\\u3000펍블추크 씨(도매와 소매를 같이하는 곡물중간상인, 60세)는 아주 조바심을 내며 나를 기다리고 있었다. 그는 자신의 2륜 경마차(바퀴 2 개인 마차)를 이용해 아침 일찍 대장간(주인공의 집)에 들러 내 유산상 속 소식을 전해 들었던 것이다.\\n\\u3000그는 우리(주인공,  조, 웹슬 씨, 펍블추크 씨)가 예전에 〈 런던의 상인 조지 반웰의 이야기 〉 (1731년)이란 책을 읽었던 그 응접실에 나를 위한 조촐한 간식을 준비한 채, 자신의 점원에겐 “통로에서 물러나 있어라!”고 단단히 일러두었던  것이다.  신성하신 분(주인공)께서  지나가 실 통로라면서.\\n\\u3000(잠깐 앞뒤 상황설명 : 〈 런던의 상인 조지 반웰의 이야기 〉이란 책 의 내용을 아셔야 『 위대한 유산 』 을 이해하시기가 쉽습니다. 책 내용\\n: 평범한 수습공이 신분상승을 꿈꾸다 나쁜 길로 들어선 결과 자신에게 은혜를 베풀던 ‘고용주와 고용주의 딸’을 버리고 나중에는 살인까지 저지르며 패가망신하더라는 이야기?????←저도 안 읽어봐서 모름. 네 이버검색 ‘조지 릴로’와 ‘조지 반웰’ 참조. 주인공이 이 책을 접하게 된 사연은 15장을  참조바람)\\n\\u3000“오~ 친애하는 핍(주인공 이름, 18세) 군.” 펍블추크  씨(60세)가  내  두 손을 꽉 붙잡으며  말했다.\\n응접실에 그와  나  그리고  간식만  남게  되었을  때  그가  말했다. “자네의 행운에 대해 꼭 축하한다는 말을 해주고 싶었네. 자넨 그럴\\n자격이 충분하니까, 암  충분하고말고!”\\n\\u3000이 말은 그가 자신의 속마음을 슬쩍 드러내려고 할 때 그가 주로 사용하는 아주 예민한 방법이었다. 이제 그가 무엇을 바라는 지만 알면 되었다.\\n\\u3000“아아!” 펌블추크 씨가 코를 벌렁거리며 나에 대한 칭찬을 잠시 널어놓은 후 본격적으로 얘기를 꺼내기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000“내가 이런 일이 성사되는 데 미력하게나마 기여를 했었음에 틀림없다는 사실에 나는 그만 아아 이 얼마나 놀라운 일인가! 이건 대단한 긍지이네. 암 나의  긍지이고말고.”\\n\\u3000나는 “그 점에 있어서는 절대 말을 해서도 암시를 해서도 안 된다는 사실”을 기억해달라고 간절히  부탁해야했다.\\n\\u3000“내 친애하는 어린 벗이여(친구여)!” 펌블추크 씨가  말했다.  “만약 내가 그렇게 부르는 것을 자네가 허락만 해준다면야….”\\n나는 “물론이지요.”라며 약간 투덜거리며  말했다.\\n\\u3000그러자 펌블추크 씨가 다시 한 번 내 두 손을 꼭 붙들었다. 그의 양복 조끼에서 어떤 격한 울림이 전해져 오는 것만 같았다. 다소 야비한 수작이긴 하지만 분명 그의 내면에서 어떤 떨림이 그의 감정을 북받치게 한 것도  같았다.\\n\\u3000“오! 나의 친애하는 젊은 벗이여(친구여), 나게 의지해주게. 내가 미 력하게나마 자네가 없는 동안에도 요셉(주인공의 매형 세례명)이 그 사실(상속인 발설금지)을 절대 망각하지(잊지) 못하게 철저히 주의를 주겠네. 요셉은 그러니까  요셉은!”\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨는 가엾어 죽겠다는 마냥 “오~ 요셉아!! 오~ 요셉아!!!” 라는 말을 연발한  후,  고개를  좌우로 흔들더니  내가 보는 앞에서 자신 의 손가락으로 자기 머리를 톡톡 두드렸다.\\n\\u3000물론 이것은 요셉(주인공의 매형)에게 부족한 분별력을 우회적으로 표현한 것이었다.\\n\\u3000“자 그럼, 내 친애하는 어린 벗이여.” 펌블추크 씨가 말했다. “우선 음식부터 들게나. 여기까지 오며 얼마나 배가 고팠겠나. 자 편히 식사 하게. 내 앞이라고 주저 말게. 어떤 요리인지 궁금한가? 내가 말해줌세. 이건 ‘수퇘지 살코기 구이 전문점’에서  막  요리해온  닭튀김이네. 이건 같은 음식점에서 공수해온 소 혓바닥 살을 삶은 요리이네, 이건  같은 음식점에서 날라 온 하나 혹은 두개 정도의 그 무엇이냐 뭐 그렇     고 그런 음식들이겠지. 음식이 조촐하다 나를 원망 말아 주게. 아~ 자 네를 위해 이 정도 밖에 대접할 수 없는 내가 몹시 원망스러워 목이다  멜 정도라네.”\\n펌블추크 씨가 잠시 자리에서 일어나 격한 감정의 율동을 취해보인\\n\\n\\n후 다시 자기자리에  앉았다.\\n\\u3000“아~ 정녕 내 앞에 있는 이 늠름한 젊은이가 유년기 시절부터 나와 즐거움을 나누던 정녕 그 어린 벗이란 말인가? (주인공의 손을 잡으려다 말고) 아~ 감히 내가… 아~ 감히 내가…?”\\n\\u3000그가 말하는 “감히 내가”란 말의 의미는 그가 나에게 악수를 청해도 되겠느냐는 의미였다. 나는 괜찮다고 말했다. 그러자 그가 열렬히 그리고 뜨겁게 그리고 불타오르게 악수를 한 후 다시 자기 자리로 가 앉았다.\\n\\u3000“여기 와인이 있네.” 펌블추크 씨(잡곡상, 60세)가 말했다. “우리 함께 한 잔 하세. 행운의 여신에게 감사하고 그리고 그녀가 분별 있는 선택을 해 자네를 간택해준 것에 대해 감사하세나! 그럼에도 불구하고 아직 난….”\\n펌블추크 씨가 말하려다 말고 자리에서 일어나 말했다.\\n\\u3000“내 눈으로 자네를… 아, 이런 훌륭한 자네를 위해 건배하면서도…    아, 이 북받치는 내 감정들을 어떻게 표현해줘야 할지…, (주인공에게 악수를 청하려다 말고) 어떤가? 감히 나라도 좋다면 자네에게….”\\n\\u3000내가 “좋으시다면 요.”라고 말씀드렸고 그렇게 그는 다시 한 번 내  손을 꼭 붙잡으며 악수를 한 후 자리로 돌아가 와인 잔을 쭉 들이켠 후 잔을 거꾸로 뒤집어 놓았다. 나도 와인 잔을 쭉 마신 후 잔을 뒤집어 놓았다. 그런데 취기가 바로 돌았다.\\n\\u3000만약 물구나무를 선 자세로 와인 한잔을 마셨다고 해도 이렇게 빨리는 취하지 않았을 것이다. 취기가 내 머리로 직행했던 것이다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨가 닭 날개 튀긴 것을 떼어내 내게 권했다. 그와 동시에 소 혓바닥을 삶은 요리 중에서 가장 좋아 보이는 혓바닥 얇은 조각을 내 접시에 놓아주었다. 이 요리들이 어찌나 맛있었던지 그 어떤 돼지고기 부위가 이들 앞에 나타나도 상대가 안 될 정도였다. 이와 비교해서 말하자면 그 자신은 자기 자신에게는 전혀 신경 쓰지 않았다. (잠깐 앞뒤설명 : 펌블추크 씨는 예전에 주인공과 식사 할 때 딱딱한 빵 껍 데기들과 물에 탄 우유를 준 적이 있었다.)\\n“아! 닭이여, 아 닭이여! 너는 거의 생각하지 못했겠지.”\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨가 접시에 놓인 닭요리의 이름을 불러 관심을 강하게 불 러일으키는 수사법(말하기)을 쓰고  있었다.\\n\\u3000“네가 갓 날아 나온 어린 병아리였을 때는 네 앞에 어떤 일이 닫칠지 너는 거의 생각하지 못했겠지. 너는 거의 생각하지 못했을 거야, 이 허름한 지붕 아래에서 이 늠름한 젊은이의 원기 회복을 위한 가벼운 식사음식이 될 줄을 너는 거의 생각하지 못했겠지. 아, 이를 너의 약함 이랴 부르랴? 아니면 너의 허약함이라 부르랴? 이도 저도 아니면 병아 리의 약점이라 부르랴? 예라 모르겠다, 네 좋을 대로 해라.”\\n펌블추크 씨가 자리에서 다시 일어났다. “어떤가? 감히 나라도? 감히 나라도…?”\\n\\u3000“좋으시다면 요.”라고 내가 더 이상 말할 필요가 없어졌다. 그가 자 리에서 일어나자마자 내 손을 붙잡으며 악수를 했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000신기한 일이었다. 그가 그렇게나 자주 나와 악수를 했음에도 어떻게 해서 그의 손이 내 나이프(칼)에 찔리지 않았었는지 정말 모를 일이었다.\\n\\u3000“그리고 자네 누나는.” 그가 좀 꾸준히 음식을 먹는 듯 보이더니 이내 곧 내 가족 얘기를 꺼내기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000“자네를 손수 길러주었다는 그 모든  영예로움을 만끽해야할 자네 누나 말일세. 정말 안타까운 그림이 되었네. 영예로움을 이제 막 자랑할 수 있을 이때에 몸 상태가 그렇게 되었으니, 쯧쯧. (그러다 말고 벌떡 정신이 들어 주인공에게 악수를 청하려고) 하지만 나라도….”\\n\\u3000나는 그가 또 내게 와서 악수를 할 것 같아서 그를 제지하기 위해  이렇게 말해야했다.\\n“누나의 건강을 위해 한 잔 할까요.”\\n\\u3000“아하!” 펌블추크 씨(잡곡상, 60세)가 이 얼마나 시의적절한 말이냐며 온갖 감탄사를 연발하더니 말을 너무 많이 해서인지 완전히 녹초가 되어 자신의 의자 뒤로 몸이 푹 기대어졌다.\\n\\u3000“그게 바로 자네 같은 젊은이가 누나와 매형에게 보답하는 길이지. 암 그렇고말고. 그런 기특한 생각을 다 할 줄 알다니 이젠 정말 ‘경(귀족)’이라 불러야겠네.”\\n\\u3000이때까지만 해도 나는 경(귀족)이 무슨 말인지 몰랐다. 하지만 내가 경이 아님은 확실했다. 그리고 지금 이 자리에 제 3자는 없음도 분명한 사실이었다.\\n펌블추크 씨가 이어서  말했다.\\n\\u3000“그것이 바로 고귀한  품격을  지닌  귀족들이  나아갈 방향이지! 한없 이 너그러운 마음씨를 지니는 것, 그리고 한없이 상냥한 자세 말일세.” 노예근성을 가진 펌블추크는 입에 대지도 않은 자신의 와인 잔을 황\\n급히 내려놓으며 또 다시 자기 의자에서 일어났다. 그가 말했다.\\n“이 비천한 저에게도, 호의를 베푸시어…, 어떤가? 감히 나라도… 감히 나라도….”\\n\\u3000그가 악수를 한 후 자기 자리로 다시 돌아갔다. 그런 후 그는 내 누 나(주인공과 20살차이. 악당에서 뒷머리를 족쇄-다리에 차는  쇠사슬-  로 강타당한 후 반신마비가 되어 간호를 받고 있는 중)의 쾌유를 기원 한다며 와인을 한 잔 쭉 들이켰다.\\n\\u3000“잊지는 마세. 눈을 감을 필요는 없으니까.” 펌블추크 씨가 말했다. “자네 누나가 성격이 급하고 좀 모질다는  것은  인정하세.  하지만 다 자네 잘되라고 그런 것 아니겠는가. 우리 그렇게만 생각해두세.”\\n\\u3000내가 뭔가를 깨닫기 시작한 것이 바로  그때쯤이었다.  그의  얼굴에 점점 더 홍조가 띄어갔기 때문이다(흥분한 상태).\\n\\u3000나로 말할 것 같으면, 나는 내 얼굴전체가 와인에 깊숙이 담가진 것  같이 느껴졌다. 그래서 얼굴피부에 스며든 와인 때문에 꼭 안면이 온통 쑤신 것 같이  느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000“양복을 맞추었는데 여기(펌블추크 씨의 가게)로 보내달라고 했습니다. 잠시 맡아주셨으면  해요.”\\n\\u3000그러자 펌블추크 씨(잡곡상인, 60세)는 그런 중요한 일을 자신에게 맡겨준 것에 대해 황홀해서 미칠 지경이라고 방방 뛰었다. (-_-)\\n\\u3000“마을 사람들에게 제가 양복 입은 모습을 보이고 싶지 않습니다.”라고 말하고 그 이유를 여러 대자 그는 기절초풍하겠다며 내 의견에 대 찬성한다며 찬송가를 부를  기세였다.\\n\\u3000지금 이 자리엔 그밖에 없었다. 자신이 신뢰할 만하다는 사실을 넌지시 알리고 싶었던지 그가 “혹시?”라고 짧게 말한 다음 아주 부드러 우면서도 아주 느끼하게 질문을  해댔다.\\n\\u3000“기억나는가? 우리가 함께 산수(더하기 빼기) 놀이를 하던 날(주인공이 처음으로 미스 해비샴의 집을 방문하던 날)을 말이야? 기억하는가? 우리 다함께 법원으로 가 자네의 수습공계약서에 공증인 도장을 받던 날을 말이야?”\\n요컨대 그의 질문의 요지는 이랬다.\\n\\u3000“자네가 가장 좋아하던 사람이 나란 것을 잊진 않았겠지? 자네와 가장 가까운 친구가 널 언제나 나였다는 사실을 잊진 말게?”\\n\\u3000만약 내가 그 날 먹은 와인 잔보다 딱 10배를 더 많이 마셨다고 하더라도, 나는 간파하고 있었어야 했다. 내가 그와 단 한 차례도 친했던 적이 없었음을 말이다. 또한 나는 아주 솔직히 그의 말을 부정했었어야 했다.\\n\\u3000그럼에도 불구하고 지금까지의 모든 이유들(술과 아부)로 인해 나는 기분이 좋아져 ‘내가 혹시 그동안 이 분을 단단히 오해하고 있었던 것은 아닌지? 이렇게나 분별력 있으시고, 이렇게나 대인관계가 뛰어나신 분, 이렇게나 젊은이의 마음을 기쁘게 할 수 있는 최상의 친구를 그동안 내가 단단히 오판하고 있었구나!’라고 생각하기 시작했고 술자리가 계속되면서 그와 내가 예전부터 친밀한 관계를 유지하고 있었다고 내 자신도  확신하기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000점차 그(펌블추크 씨, 60세)는 나를 신뢰하기 시작했다. 그래서 자신의 사업에 관해 내게 조언을 구하기까지 했다.\\n그가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“만약 가게에 딸린 부지(땅)가 조금만 더 확대된다면, 그 부지를 이용해서 곡물(옥수수 같은 것)과 씨앗 거래에 대한 큰 합병과 독점을 어떻게 한 건 터뜨려보겠는데…. 그렇게만 된다면 이 인근 상권에서는 전대미문의 대사건이 될 텐데. 다만 이 로또를 터뜨리기 위해선 지금 으로선 하나 부족한 게 있다네, 다름  아니라 추가 자본이네. 다른 건  필요 없네. 딱 두 단어만 있으면 되니까. ‘추가 자본’ 말일세.”\\n펌블추크 씨가 계속  말했다.\\n\\u3000“이 사업에서 추가 자금이 필요한 때가 지금이네. 만약 익명의 파트 너가, 아니 파트너께서 이 사업에 추가 자금을 투자한다면 말일세, 파 트너는 다만 자신이 직접 들르던 아니면 대리인을 시켜 확인해보던 기분 내킬 때면 가게에 들러 회계장부들을 점검해본다거나 하면 될 텐데. 내 말은 그러니까 일단 한 차례만 투자를 해두면 그는 일 년에 두 번 정도 가게에 들러 자기 몫의 수익을 호주머니에 넣어 가면 되네. 당기순이익의 최대 50%까지 내 조율해줄 수 있네. 내 말은 그러니까, 오해는 하지 말게나, 난 그저 이 사업이 재력을 겸비한 젊은 영혼의  신사가 한 번쯤 주의를 기울여보기에 좋은 기회이지 않을까 해서 하는 말이네.”\\n그가  계속 말했다.\\n\\u3000“저, 그러니까, 그래 자네는 어떻게 생각하는가? 자네 의견을 들고 싶네.  자네  생각은 어떤가?”\\n나는 이렇게 의견을  표명했다.\\n\\n\\n“잠깐만 기다려주세요!”\\n\\u3000아주 포괄적인 의미가 담긴 답변이면서도 아주 뚜렷한 의미가 담긴 답변인 것 같은 내 대답은 그에게 엄청난 감명을 주었다. 그  결과 그는 더 이상 내 손을 잡아도 되는지를 물으려고도 하지 않았다.\\n그는 “나는 꼭 자네와 악수를 해야겠네.”라며 악수를 하고 또 했다. \\n우리는 와인을 다  마셨다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨는 내게 “요셉(주인공의 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 매형)이 기대에 부응할 수 있도록 내 노력함세.”라며 맹세하고 또 맹세했다. 하지만 나는 정작 그 맹세가 무엇을 말하는지 알 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000그는 또한 “자네에게 능률적이고 지속적인 서비스가 제공될 수 있도록 내 최선을 다하겠네.”라며 맹세하고 또 맹세했다. 하지만 나는 정작 그 서비스가 무엇을 말하는지 알 수 없었다.\\n그는 또한 내게 비밀 하나를 알려주었다.\\n\\u3000“난 자네가 성공할 줄 알았다네. ‘저 애는 남다르다. 명심해두자. 저 애의 미래는 어느 아이들의 미래와는 확연하게 다를 테니까.’라고.”\\n\\u3000확실히 그는 그 비밀을 지금까지 아주 완벽하게 지켜왔음이 분명했다.\\n그가 눈물이 가득한 웃음을 지어보이며  말했다. “지금 생각해봐도 그건 아주 특별한 예감이었네.” “저도 그렇게 생각해요.”라고 내가  말했다.\\n마침내 나는 정신이 약간 흐릿한 상태로 밖으로 나올 수 있었다. 햇빛(기쁨의 근원)의 작용에 평소와는 다른 뭔가가 있었다. 굳이 어\\n떤 길을 택한 것도 아닌데 꾸벅꾸벅 졸면서 어느새 유료 마차 도로(‘읍내’와 ‘주인공마을’의 중간지점)에 들어서고 있는 나를 발견했기 때문 이다.\\n\\u3000거기서, 나(18세)는 펌블추크 씨(곡물상인, 60세)가 나를 부르는 소리에 정신이 퍼뜩 깨었다. 그는 햇볕이 내리쬐는 거리에서 서서, 그러니까 여기서 한참 떨어진 아래쪽에서 있었다. 그가 나보고 멈춰보라며 크게 몸짓을 하고  있었다.\\n나는 멈추었고, 그가 숨 가쁜 채로 올라왔다.\\n\\u3000“이런, 내 친애하는 친구여.” 그가 말을 할 수 있을 정도로 숨을 돌리자 말했다.\\n\\u3000“아직은 못 보내주겠네, 친구. 자네에게 내 호의의 표시를 한 번 더하지 못하고서는 자넬 보내주지 못하겠네. 어떤가? 오랜 친구로서 그리고 자네의 행복을 비는 한 사람으로서? 나와 악수를?”\\n우리는 적어도 100번째의 악수를 나눴다.\\n\\u3000그때 마차가 도로를 지나가려하자, 그가 이 세상에서 가장 분개한 태도로 내(주인공)가 가는 길에서 비끼라며 젊은 짐 마차꾼에게 호통을 쳤다. 그런 다음 내 축복을 기원한다고 말 한 후 내가 마차도로의 굽어진 코스를 완전히 돌 때까지 손을 흔들며 거기에 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000그러고 나서야 나는 들판으로 들어설 수 있었다. 그곳에 있던 울타리 밑에서 한참동안 낮잠을 잔 후 나는 다시 집을 향해 걸어갔다.\\n\\u3000나는 런던으로 가지고 갈 짐이 거의 없었다. 왜냐하면 내가 애초 소유한 짐이 별로 없었거니와 그것들도 이제 내 새로운 신분에 적합하지 않았기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 같은 날 오후(출발전날) 나는 짐을 싸기 시작했다. 더욱이 내일 아침 필요한 물건인 줄 알면서도 미친 듯이 짐을 싸고 있었다.\\n그것은 한 순간도 허비되어서는 안 된다는 핑계 때문이었다.\\n\\u3000그렇게  화요일이 지나고, 그렇게 수요일이 지나고, 또 그렇게 목요일이 지나갔다.\\n\\u3000금요일 아침이 되었을 때 나는 약속한대로 펌블추크 씨 댁으로 갔다. 새 양복을 받아오고 읍내에 들른 김에 미스 해비샴(갑부, 부자) 마님도  방문하기 위해서였다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨는, 내가 새 양복을 입을 수 있도록 자신의 안방을 내주었다. 내가 온다고 그가 특별히 안방을 깨끗한 천들로 장식해놓았다.\\n\\u3000새 양복들은 다소  기대에 미치지 못했다. 약간 어긋났다고 해야 할까? 뭐 그랬다. 당연한 결과라는 생각이 들었다. 아마도 모든 새 옷이  그럴 것이다. 애타게 입어보고 싶었던 옷이 막상 완성돼 입어보게 되면, 애초 착용자의 기대에 좀 못 미치게 느껴지기 마련이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 새 양복을 입은 지 30분 정도가 지나고, 그리고 펌블추크 씨의 작은 화장대 거울로 내 다리를 비춰보는 쓰잘머리 없는 노력에 온갖 포즈를 취해보고 나니, 그나마 옷들이 나와 어울리는 것도 같았다.\\n\\u300016킬로미터(마차로 1시간거리) 정도 떨어진 이웃 읍내에 그날 아침 장(시장)이 서고 있었다. 그래서 펌블추크 씨(곡물상인, 60세)는 집에 없었다.\\n\\u3000내가 언제 떠날지도 확실하게 언질을 주지 않았기 때문에 작별인사랍시고 더 이상 그와 악수할 필요는 없게 되었다. 그와의 악수가 약간 내키지  않았기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000새 옷도 이젠 맞는 것 같고 펌블추크 씨와 더이상 악수를 나눌 필요도 없고 보니 그럭저럭 일이 훌륭하게 전개되는 느낌이 들었다.\\n\\u3000그래서 용기를 내 새 옷을 입은 채로 밖으로 나왔다. 펌블추크 씨의  가게 직원 앞을 지날 때는 굉장히 부끄러웠다.\\n\\u3000‘일요일 날 교회에 예배 보러 가기 위해 정장차림을 한 어색한 모습의 조(주인공의 매형, 대장장이)’처럼  나도 지금 그런  개인적인 불리함에 빠져 있는 것은 아닌지 나쁜 쪽으로 의심이 들었다.\\n\\u3000나는 뒷길로 빙 돌아서 미스 해비샴의 저택으로 갔다. 내 장갑의 가운데 손가락이 길고 뻣뻣해서  나는  부자연스럽게  초인종을  눌러야했다.\\n\\u3000세라 포킷(좀 긴 부연설명 : 호두껍데기로 만들어진 것 같은 얼굴에 주름이 많고 입이 고양이 입같이 커다란 결혼하지 않은 주름투성이 노파. 소설 속에서 주인공의 신분이 변할 때마다 정문을 열어주는 역할을 하는 엑스트라. 세라 포킷이란 이름을 기억하면 소설의 흐름 이해가 쉬움. 15장 참조)이 정문으로 나왔다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 싹 달라진 내 모습을 보고 분명 당황해 휘청거리며 뒤로 물러났다. 더욱이 그녀의 호두껍데기 같은 얼굴 표정이 ‘갈색’에서 ‘녹황 색’(채소색깔=노란색+초록색)으로 변해갔다.\\n“너는?” 그녀가 말했다. “오, 이럴 수가! 그래  무슨  일로  왔지?” “런던으로  가게  되었어요.  세라  포킷  양(미스  세라  포킷).” 내가 말\\n했다. “떠나기 전에 미스 해비샴 마님께 인사를 드리려고요.”\\n\\u3000나의 등장은 예기치 못한 것이었다. 왜냐하면 그녀도 당황해 나를 안뜰에 내버려둔 채 정문을 잠근 후 나를 들여보내도 좋을지를 마님께 물어보기 위해 들어갔기 때문이다.(원래는 정문에 들여보내기 전에 마 님께 물어봐야 한다는  의미)\\n\\u3000아주 잠깐 시간이 지체된 후, 그녀가 다시 돌아와 나를 데리고 올라갔다. 계단을 오르는 내내 그녀는 나를 빤히 쳐다보고 있었다.\\n\\u3000미스 해미샴(어마어마한 부자, 하지만 굉장히 이기적인 사람임)은 길게 펼쳐진 테이블이 놓여있는 방에서 목발 지팡이에 의지한 채 걷기 운동을  하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000방은 옛날 그대로였다. 여전히 촛불이 켜져 있었다. 우리가 입구에서 인기척을 내자, 그녀가 걷기를 멈추고 돌아봤다. 그녀가 막 썩은 신부용 케이크 앞에 다다랐을 무릎이었다.\\n“세라,  넌  안  돼(들어오면  안  돼).”  그녀가  말했다.  “그래,  핍?” “내일 런던으로 떠나게 되었어요. 미스 해비샴 마님.” 나는 몹시 신\\n중하게 말을 했다. “그래서 제가 인사드리러 와도 꺼리시지 않으실 거    라 생각했어요.”\\n\\u3000“그래 좋아 보이는구나, 핍(주인공이름,18세).” 그녀가 목발 지팡이로 내 주위로 동그란 원을 그려 보이며 말했다.\\n\\u3000나를 변화시켰던 친절한 사람인 그녀가 이제 마지막 선물을 선사하기 위한 행동인 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000“지난번에 뵙고 난 이후로 저는 상당히 큰 재산을 상속받게 되었어요, 미스 해비샴 마님.” 내가 머뭇거리며 말했다. “아주 감사하게 생각하고 있어요, 마님!”\\n\\u3000“아, 아!” 내 말에 당황해하고 질시해하는 세라(주름투성이 노파)를 보고 미스 해비샴이 아주 기뻐하며 말했다. “그래 재거스 씨(런던 변호사, 주인공 후견인의 법률대리인)가 왔다 갔었다. 그에게서 네 얘기를 들었다. 그래 내일이라고,  핍?”\\n“예, 마님.”\\n“어느 부자의 양자가 된다지?” \\n“예, 마님.”\\n“이름은 모르고?”\\n“예, 마님.”\\n“재거스 씨가 네 후견자 될 예정이고?” “예, 마님.”\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴의 질문과 내 대답에 세라 포킷(주름투성이 노파)이 아주 질시하며 경악했다. 세라 포킷의 일그러지는 표정을 지켜보고 있던 미스 해비샴은 계속해서 내게 질문을 던졌고 그럼 그럴수록 내 대답에 당황하고 경악해하는 세라 포킷의 얼굴을 아주 고소한 듯 미스 해비샴은  쳐다보고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“좋아!” 그녀가 계속 말했다. “이제 전도유망한  젊은이가 되겠구나,  핍. 그래 잘 다녀오너라. 너는 보상을 받을 자격이 있다. 항상 재거스   씨의 지시에 따르도록  해라.”\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴이 나를 쳐다보았다. 그런 후 그녀가 세라를 쳐다보았다. 세라의 질시어린 얼굴표정을 모두 놓치지 않고 있던 미스 해비샴의 얼 굴에서 이제 잔인한 미소가 드러나고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“잘 가거라. 핍! 너는 항상 핍이라는 네 이름을 간직해야 한다, 알고 있겠지.”\\n“예, 마님.”\\n“그래 잘 가거라. 핍!” \\n\\u3000그녀(미스 해비샴)가 손을 뻗어주었고 나는 무릎을 꿇은 후 그녀의 손등에 입을 맞추었다. 그녀를 찾아가기 전에 어떻게 작별인사를 해야 할지 생각하지 않고 갔었는데 바로 지금 자연스럽게 작별을 고하게 되 었다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴은 기묘한 승리의 눈을 하고서 세라 포킷(주름투성이 노파)을 쳐다보았다. 그리고 나는 그렇게 내 친절한 은인에게서 벗어날 수 있었다. 내가 방을 나올 때 그녀는 발목 지팡이 위에 두 손을 포갠 채 촛불이 희미하게 밝히고 있는 방 한 복판에 서 있었다. 그녀 뒤로 거미집에 가려진 섞은 신부용 케이크가 보였다.\\n\\u3000세라 포킷이 나를  아래로 안내했다. 내가 마치 사라져야만 될 유령이 된 기분이 들었다. 세라 포킷이 여전히 내 모습에 당황해 혼돈의 마지막 단계에서 벗어나질 못하고 있었기 때문이었다.\\n내가 말했다.\\n“잘 있으세요, 포킷 양(미스  포킷).”\\n\\u3000그녀는 나를 응시할 뿐이었다. 내가 방금 무슨 말을 했는지 그녀 귀에  들리지 않았다.\\n\\u3000저택에서 어느 정도 떨어진 후 나는 왔던 방향 그대로 펌블추크 씨 댁으로 돌아갔다. 펌블추크 씨 댁에 도착한 후 새 양복을 벗고 곱게  접어 보따리에 넣었다. 헌 옷으로 갈아입은 후 보따리를 든 채 집으로 향했다.\\n\\u3000거짓말 하나도 안 보태고서 말하건대 내가 비록 집으로 돌아가는 내내 그 옷보따리를 들고 있어야했음에도 불구하고 나는 그게 너무나, 너무나  편안하고 좋았다.\\n이로써, 그렇게만  느리게  흘러갈  것  같았던  6일도  다  지나갔다. 시간은 내가 생각했던 것보다 훨씬 더 착실하게 나를 향해 다가오고\\n있었다. 이제 내일이면  떠나야했다.\\n\\u30006일 저녁이나 기다려야 했던 시간이 5일에서 4일이 되고, 3일에서 2 일로 줄어들자, 나는 점점 더 조(주인공의  매형)와  비디(여자이름)와 함께 보내는 시간들에 감사하게  되었다.\\n\\u3000마지막 날 저녁에, 나는 그들을 기쁘게 해주기 위해 새 양복을 꺼내  입고 나와 자기 전까지 자체발광 앉아 있었다.\\n\\u3000이 즈음해서 경사스러운 날이면 반드시 우리 집 식탁 위에 오르는 닭구이가 차려진 화끈한 저녁을 먹고 입가심으로 뜨거운 ‘계란 술’(맥 주나 브랜디에 계란 탄 거라고 하네요. 네이버검색참조)을 약간 마셨다.\\n\\u3000이 모든 것에도 불구하고 우리 모두는 아주 침울했다. 우리 모두는 기분이 참 좋은 것처럼 행동했지만 침울했던 분위기는 더 나아지지 않 았다.\\n\\u3000나(주인공, 18세)는 아침 5시에 작은 여행용 손가방을 들고 마을을 떠나기로  되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형)에게는 혼자 가고 싶다고 말했는데 실은 걱정이 되었기 때문이다. 염증을 일으킬 정도로 두려웠다고 보는 것이 맞다. 우리가 함께 마차 터미널에 나타난다면 그곳에서 나와 조의 상반된 모습 사이에 주어질 다른 사람들의 시선이 두려웠고 그것을 회피하려는 감에서 비롯된 의도였다. 유감스럽고 가슴이 아프지만 나도 어쩔 수 없었다.\\n내 자신에게는 내 말에 나쁜 의도가 없는 것처럼 타일렀다.\\n\\u3000하지만 마지막 날(출발 하루 전) 저녁에 내 작은 다락방에 다시 올라왔을 때 나는 내 의도에 나쁜 마음이 있다는 것을 받아들이지 않을 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000다시 아래층으로 내려가 조에게 제발 내일 아침 나와 함께 마차 터 미널까지 가 달라고 간청하고 싶었다. 하지만 나는 그러지 않았다.\\n\\u3000밤새 산산조각 난 꿈에 시달리고 있었다. 대형 사륜마차(바퀴4개)가 나타나 내 목적지인 런던이 아니라 전혀 낮선 곳을 향해 내달렸다. 가죽 끈에 묶여 있는 것은 말들이 아니었다. 때로는 개들이 묶여 있었고, 때론 고양이들이, 때론 돼지들이, 때론 사람들이 가죽 끈에 묶여 있었다. 그 어디에도 말들은  없었다.\\n\\u3000날이 밝아오고 있었다. 새들이 다시 지져 길 때 산산조각 난 잠과  괴상한 꿈에 시달려 난 이미 굴복한 상태였다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 일어나 옷을 대충 입고 창가에 앉아 이제 마지막이 될 바깥 풍경을 내려다보았다. 그러다 깜빡 잠이 들었다.\\n\\u3000비디(여자이름)는 새벽  일찍 일어나 내 아침상을 차리고 있었다. 비록 내가 창가에서 잠을 잔 시간이 채 한 시간도 못 되었지만 잠결에도 부엌에서 나는 음식 냄새를 맡을 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000그때 문득 끔찍한 생각이 떠올랐다. ‘혹시 내가 잠을 너무 자서 마차 시간을 놓친 것은 아닐까? 벌써 오후가 되어버린 것은 아닐까?’하는 생각에  깜짝 놀랐다.\\n\\u3000하지만, 오랜 뒤에 무척 오랜 뒤에 찻잔들이 식탁 위에 다시 놓이는 소리며 찻잔들끼리 가볍게 부딪쳐 “쨍그랑!” 거리는 소리가 들렸다. 나는 아래층으로 내려갈 용기를 완전히 잃고 말았다.\\n\\u3000결국 나는 방에 쪼그리고 앉아, 비디(여자이름)가 아래층에서 “늦겠 어.”라며 부를 때까지, 내 방 문을 열었다가 닫고, 내 작은 여행용 가방 끈을 풀었다가 잠그고, 다시 풀었다가 다시 조이고를 반복하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000난 허겁지겁 밥을 먹었다. 맛을 느낄 새도 없었다. 식사가 끝난 후 자리에서 일어나며 활기차게 이렇게 말했다. 마치 이 말이 방금 막 떠올랐다는 듯이 나는 이렇게  말했다.\\n“이런! 그만 가봐야 할 것 같은데!”\\n\\u3000그런 다음 나는 평소처럼 자신의 의자에 앉아서 웃고 있는, 고개를 끄떡이고 있는, 고개를 흔들고 있는 내 친누나(20살차이)에게 키스를 했다. 비디의 뺨에도 키스해주었다. 조와 작별인사를 할 때에는 그의 목을 끌어안고 포용했다.\\n그런 다음 내 조그만 여행용 가방을 챙겨 밖으로 나왔다.\\n\\u3000내가 얼마쯤 갔을까 뒤에서 허둥지둥 거리는 소리가 들려왔다. 나는 뒤돌아보았고 때마침 조(매형)가 내 등 뒤로 오래된 낡은 신발 한 짝(1 개)을 던지고 있는 모습이  보였다. 그리고 비디는 다른 쪽  낡은 신발    한 짝(1개)을 다른 쪽으로 던지고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 멈춰서 모자를 벗어 흔들어 보였다. 내 친애하는 오랜 벗인 조도 그의 강인한 오른 팔을 머리 들어 흔들어 보였다.\\n조가 쉰 목소리로 외치고 있었다. “안녕, 핍!”\\n비디는 앞치마로 얼굴을 가리고  있었다.\\n그것이 그날 내가 그들을 본 마지막 모습이었다. \\n\\n■ 이 부분에서 옮긴이의 느낀  점  (19장  느낀 점 간략히) :\\n\\u3000원래 남의 말을 들을 때 딴 생각을 잘 하는 편이라 상대방이 요구하는 말과는 다른 엉뚱한 대답을 하곤 한다. 이 버릇은 책을 읽을 때도 마찬가지다. 남들은 “이 책의 내용은 이거다”라고  말하는데  난  같은 책을 읽고 딴 생각을 하느라 흐름을 놓친 나머지 “이 책, 그 내용 아 니던데. 자수성가하는 행복한 내용이던데.”라며 남들 탓을 하곤 한다. 이젠 체크를 받아야 할 일도 없으니 맥을 놓친다고 내게 불리할 일은  없다.\\n\\u3000그래서 『 위대한 유산 』 도 내가 그동안 읽어왔던 많은 소설처럼 밝은 내용인 줄 알았다. 물론 주인공이 고생도 하지만 전체적으로는 자수성가하는   내용인  줄   알았는데  이제  보니  행복한  소설이   아니네.\\n-_-.. 엄청 슬픈 내용이네. 이럴 줄 알았으면 처음부터 우리말로 옮기 지도 않았을 텐데 싶다. 이미 시작했고 구독자도 세 분이 계시기 때문에 그리고 나도 디킨스 소설을 많이 좋아하고 해서 끝까지 가겠지만.\\n\\u3000갑자기 이런 생각이 든다. 어리석으면 용감하다더니, 이 소설을 옮겨 보겠다고 이 소설은 밝은 내용이라고 혼자 착각하고서 시작한 내 무모 함도 참 대책  없다.\\n\\u3000세상에는 참 느낄 일들이 많은 것 같다. 어쨌든 우리말 옮김은 계속 됩니다. 전혀 그만 둘 마음 없음. ~_~..\\n\\u3000(옮긴이의 느낀 점 끄읏~)\\n\\n\\u3000(다시 본문 시작)\\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000나는 내가 생각했던 것보다 떠나기가 훨씬 쉽다는 생각을 하면서 빠른 걸음으로 그 자리를 벗어날 수 있었다. 만약 조와 같이 마차 터미 널까지 갔었더라면 시내 중심가 사람들이 모두 지켜보는 가운데 그가  내가 탄 마차 뒤로 오래되고 낡은 구두 한 짝(1개)을 던졌을 것이라 생각하니 아찔했다.\\n\\u3000나는 휘파람을 불었다. 그들을 떠나는 것이 아무렇지도 않게 여겨졌다.\\n\\u3000하지만 마을은 생각보다 더 조용했고 더 평화로웠다. 주변에 낀 가벼운 안개만이 엄숙한 표정을 한 채 떠오르고 있었다. 마치  내게 이제 부터 저 밖 세계를 보여주려는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 마을에서 너무나 순진하고 별 볼일 없는 애였다. 이제 저편에 있는 모든 것들은 너무나 커고 너무나 알 수 없는 것들일 것이다. 그러자 곧 바로 가슴이 북받쳐 올라 눈물이 왈칵 터져 나와 흐느껴  울고 말았다.\\n\\u3000내가 마을 끝자락에 있는 ‘손가락 모양의 길 안내문’ 옆에 다다랐을 때 일어난 일이다. 나는 길 안내문에 손을 집은 채 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“잘 있어, 오 내 정다운, 정다운 친구(손가락 모양의 길 안내문, 외 국영화에서 마을 입구에 꼭 있는 표지판 같은 거)야!”\\n\\u3000하느님도 아실 것이다. 우리는 자기 자신의 눈물들에 대해 부끄러워할 필요가 전혀 없다. “왜냐하면 눈물들은”  우리의  굳어버린  심장들 위로 눈을 뜰 수 없을 정도로까지 가로놓여 있는 흙먼지 위에 내리는 “비와 같기 때문이다.”\\n\\u3000울고 보니 전보다 기분이 한 결 좋아졌다. 그리고 울기 전보다 내  자신의 배은망덕함에 대해 더 잘 인식하게 되었고 마냥 후회되어 마음이  한결 순해졌다.\\n만약 내가 조 앞에서 울었다면 그럼 그가 나와 함께 해주었을 텐데. \\n\\u3000이런 눈물들에 완전히 잠식당하고 조용히 걸어가다 도중에 또 한 번 왈칵 눈물을 터뜨리는 바람에 내 마음은 이전보다 훨씬 완화되었다.\\n\\u3000내가 대형 사륜마차(바퀴4개)에 올라 마을을 완전히 벗어났을 때, 나는 마음이 아파 ‘마차가 말을 바꾸기 위해 역에 멈출 때 내려 집으로 돌아가 그들과 하룻밤을 더 보내고 그리고 좀 더 다정한 이별을 하고 떠나는 것이 더 좋지 않을지 심각하게 고민하기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000마차가 말을 바꾸기 위해 역에 멈춰 섰다. 하지만 아직 결정을 못한 상태였다. 그러면서 마차가 말을 바꾸기 위해 다음 번 역에 멈춰설 때 그때 내려 집으로 돌아가는 것도 상당히 실행가능한 일이라며 내 스스로를 위로하고  있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 이런 숙고(생각)에 빠져 있는 동안, 길을 따라 우리 쪽으로 오고 있는 어떤 사람이 조와 정말 닮았다는 환상에 빠져 심장이 요동치곤 했다. 마치 그가 거기에 있는 것이 가능하기라도 한 것처럼!\\n\\u3000마차가 말을 바꾸기 위해 다시 한 번 역에 멈췄다. 그 후 마차가 또 다시 말을 바꾸기 위해 다른 역에 멈춰 섰다.\\n\\u3000이젠 너무 늦었다. 너무 멀리 와서 더는 돌아갈 수 없었다. 나는 계속 마차에 있기로  했다.\\n\\u3000연극무대의 커튼처럼 안개는 장엄한 분위기를 풍기며 이제 모두 걷힌 상태였다. 그리고 내 앞에 세상이 넓게 펼쳐지고 있다.\\n\\n\\u3000“여기까지가 ‘핍(주인공이름)의 유산’ 첫 번째 단계입니다.” (←이 마지막 문장은 원문에도 있는, 디킨 스가 쓴 문장임. 하지만 소설 전체의 실제 줄거리는 ‘첫 번째 단계’라는 이런 문구와는 전혀 관련이 없음. 디킨스가 신문에 『 위대한 유산 』 을 연재하면서 임의로 넣은  문장일 뿐이에요.  하지만  20장부터는  소설의  배경이  런던사교계로 바뀐다는 사실~굿굿)\\n\\n\\n\\u3000(여기까지가 19장 끝입니다. 이어지는 이야기는 20장에서 계속 됩니다.)

그만 울어 응.”\\n\\u3000내가 주변 거리를 어슬렁거리고 있을 때 바르톨로뮤 클로즈 내로 막 들어온 눈이 붉고 키가 작은 유대인 한 명이 있었다. 역시 키가 작은 유대인이 그의 동행인 것 같았는데 어디론가 심부름을 보내버렸다.\\n\\u3000심부름꾼이 가버린 동안, 나는 이 유대인을 주목하고  있었다.  그는 지금 대단히 흥분해 신경과민 상태였다. 일종의 광란 발작 상태에 빠진 그는 금속제 가로등기둥 밑에서 불안으로 떨며 왔다 갔다 하며 이렇게  말하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“오 재거쓰, 오 재거쓰, 오옷 재거씃! 다른 놈들은 죄다 쓸데없는 소리나 늘어놓을 뿐이야. 내겐 오직 재거쓰 당신이 필요해!”\\n\\u3000내 후견인에 대한 이런 경탄할 만한 증언들은 내게 깊은 인상을 주었다. 나는 전보다 훨씬 더 존경하는 마음이 들어 경탄하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 바르톨로뮤(예수님의 제자이름) 클로즈(주변) 철제정문에 서서 리틀 브리튼 쪽으로 바라보고 있자니, 드디어, 도로를 가로질러 내 쪽으로 성큼성큼 걸어오고 있는 재거스 씨(런던에서 가장  유명한 변호 사)가 보였다. 거와 동시에  주변에서 그를  기다리고 있던 모든  사람들 이 일제히 그에게로  몰려갔다.\\n\\u3000재거스 씨가 한 손을 내 어깨위에 올려놓은 채 나를 자신의 옆에서   계속 걷게 하더니 내게는 아무런 말도 하지 않은 채, 자신을 뒤따르는 사람들을  상대하고 있었다.\\n우선,  그  수상한  남성  두  명이  재거스  씨의  얘기  상대가  되었다. “자, 얘기는 이미 끝난 걸로 아는데요. 난 당신네들에게 해줄 말이\\n더는 없소.” 재거스 씨가 자신의 집게손가락을 그들에게 내던지며 말했다. “당신네들에 대해 더는 알고 싶지 않소. 결과는 반반이오. 내가  첫 변론 때 이미 말하지 않았소. 결과는 반반이라고. 그래 웨믹에게 돈을 지불했소?”\\n\\u3000“변호사 수임료는 오늘 아침에 다 준비되었습니다, 선생.” 한 남성이 재거스 씨의 안색을 살피는 동안 다른 남성이 순종적으로 대답했다.\\n\\u3000“나는  지금 당신이 돈이 언제 모았는지 어디서 모았는지 어떤  식으로 그 돈들을 모았는지를 묻는 것이 아니요. 그래 웨믹이 돈을 받았소,   안 받았소?”\\n“받았습니다, 선생.” 두 남성이 동시에 말했다.\\n\\u3000“잘됐군. 그럼 당신네들은 가 봐도 좋소. 자, 더 이상은 용납하지 않겠소!” 재거스 씨가 그들에게 뒤로 물러서라며 손을 흔들어댔다. “만약  한 마디만 더 하면, 난 이 소송 때려치울 테니.”\\n“저희들도 좀 생각해봤습니다, 재거스 씨….” 한 남성이 모자를 벗으며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그게 바로 내가 당신네들에게 ‘하지 말라’고 말했던 것이오.” 재거스 씨가 말했다. “당신네들 생각이라니! 내가 이미 당신들을 위해 생각 하고 있지 않소. 그걸로 된 것이오. 일이 생기면 당신네들을 어디서 찾 아야하는지 알고 있소. 그러니 당신네들이 나를 찾을 생각일랑 마시오. 자, 더 이상은 용납하지 않겠소. 나는 더 들을 말도 없으니까.”\\n\\u3000재거스 씨가 그들보고 뒤로 물러나라고 재차 손사래를 치자 두 남성들은 서로의 얼굴을 바라보다 겸허히 뒤로 물러나더니 더 이상 아무 소리도  들리지 않았다.\\n\\u3000 “자 이젠 당신네들 차례요!” 재거스 씨가 잡자기 발걸음을 멈추고 어깨걸이 숄을 한 두 명의 여성들을 돌아보며 말했다. 세 명의 남성들은 온순하게도 이 두 여성에게서 떨어져 있었다.\\n재거스  씨가 말했다.\\n“아니 이게 누군가? 아멜리아 아닌가?” \\n“예  나리 저에요.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 기억하고 있겠지?” 재거스 씨가 그 즉시 쏘아붙이며 이렇게 말했다. “내가 아니었으면 자넨 지금 여기 있지도 있을 수도 없다는 사실을.”\\n\\u3000“오 나리!” 두 명의 여성이 동시에 소리치며 말했다. “제발 자비를 베풀어주세요, 나리. 저희들도 잘  안답니다.”\\n\\u3000“그래 왜?” 재거스 씨가 말했다. “그런데 갑자기 왜 내 앞에 나타난 거지?”\\n\\u3000“빌(아기이름, 독자가 전혀 알 필요 없는 이름임, 다신 안 나오는 이름임)이 걱정되서 잠을 잘 수 없어요, 나리!” 한 여성이 울면서 대답했다\\n\\u3000“자 딱 이번 한 번만 사정을 말해주지!” 재거스 씨가 말했다. “자네 아들이 지금 좋은 사람들의 품속에서 잘 지내고 있다는 사실을 자네가 계속 망각한다면 그리고 자꾸 이렇게 찾아와 자네 아들 소식을 물으며 소란을 피운다면, 자네 아들이고 자네고 뭐고 내가 혼쭐을 내줄테니까. 그리고 나도 이 일에서 손 땔 줄 알아! 그래 웨믹(변호사 사무원)에게  돈은 지불했나?”\\n“예 나리, 지금 말씀하신 것이 다 사실이겠죠?

 누가  누굴  차려  입혔다는  거야?” \\n“이 얼간아!”라며 사무원이 한 마디 덧붙였다. 사무원이 팔꿈치로 다시 한 번 의뢰인의 옆구리를 찔렀다.\\n\\u3000속절없이 꾸지람을 들은 후 이리저리 답변을 찾아보던 마이크(의뢰인)가 가까스로 말을 꺼내기  시작했다.\\n\\u3000“그 사람은 파이 만드는 사람 같은 인상을 주는 옷을 입고 있어요. 왜 그, 페이스트리 전문 요리사 있잖아요.”\\n“그가 여기 왔나?” 내 후견인이 물었다.\\n\\u3000“길모퉁이 돌면 있는 어느 집 문 앞 계단에 있어요.” 마이크가 말했다.\\n“그를 데리고 저 창문을 지나가게. 내가 그의 인상을 볼 수 있게.”   물론  여기서  말하는  창문이란  사무실에  딸린  창문을  말했다. 우리\\n세 사람은 그리로 가 블라인드에 몸을 가린 채 우연인 것처럼 의뢰인      이 그 가짜증인을 데리고 지나가길 기다렸다.\\n\\u3000곧 그들이 나타났고  내 후견인은  분노폭발 1단계였다.  그 가짜증인의 인상이 꼭 금방이라도 사람을 죽일 듯한 인상을 풍기는 키가 큰 사 람이었기 때문이다. 게다가 흰색 리넨(광택이 나는 직물) 정장을 빼어 입고 종이 모자까지 눌러쓰고 있어 이건 뭐 영락없는 살인자의 인상이 었다.\\n\\u3000게다가 앞뒤 사정을 모르는 이 제과점 주인이란 작자는 결코 술을 아니 마셨을 것 같지 않아 보였다. 이제 막 회복단계에 들어간 것 같은, 녹색 멍 자국이 난 검은 눈의 사나이였다. 또 그걸 가리려고 눈 위에 화장을 한  상태였다.\\n\\u3000“저자에게 이제 됐으니  증인  데리고  당장  꺼지라고  말하고  오게.” 내 후견인이 속이 메스껍고 역겨워 토할 것 같은 느낌이 드는 듯 사무 원에게 말했다. “그리고 도대체 저런 작자를 증인으로 데리고 온 저의 (의도)가  뭔지도 물어보게.”\\n\\u3000그런 다음 내 후견인(변호사)은 나를 데리고 자신의 집무실로 갔다. 그리고 상자에서 꺼낸 샌드위치 하나와 주머니 병에 든 셰리주(백포도 주, 식사 전에 마심) 한 병으로 선 자세로 점심식사를 했다. 그는 점심을 먹는 동안 자신이 나를 위해 어떤 준비들을 해놓고 있었는지를 설 명해주었다. 그는 자신이 먹는 샌드위치에게조차도 못살게 굴고 싶어 안달이 난 것 같이 먹었다.\\n\\u3000나는 포킷 씨의 아들이 머물고 있는 ‘바너드 여관’으로 가게 예정되어 있었다. 내 편의를 위해 새로 침대 하나도 그리로 보냈다고 했다.\\n\\u3000나는 포킷 씨의 아들과 함께 월요일까지 그곳에서 머물다가, 일요일에 포킷 씨의 아들과 함께 포킷 씨의 집을 방문하기로 예약되어 있었다. 포킷 씨에게서 본격적인 신사교육을 받기 전에 그가 내 마음에  드는지  확인하기 위해서였다.\\n\\u3000또한 나는 내 용돈이 얼마인지도 들었는데 그건 아주 후한 액수의 금액이었다. 내 후견인이 자신의 서랍들 중 하나에서 특정 상인들의 명함들을 꺼내 건네주며 이렇게  말했다.\\n\\u3000“자네가 이제부터 합당한 이유에서 필요하게 될 모든 종류의 옷들이며 그 외 여타 물건들을 구입할 때 자네가 거래하기로 예약되어 있는 상인들의 명함들이네. 자네의 신용도가 좋다는 사실을 곧 알게 될 것 이네,  핍 군.”\\n\\u3000그가 마시던, 주머니 병에 든 셰리주에서는 마치 한 통의 술통에서  나는 것 같은 강도의 술 냄새가 나고 있었는데 그것이 그를 금방 상쾌한 기분이 들게 하는 것 같았다.\\n그가 말했다.\\n“자네의  청구서(계산서)들은  이들  상점들을  통해  내가  관리하게 될\\n\\n\\n것이네. 만약 정해진 범위를 초과해 지출한다면  나는  이들  상점들을 통해 자네의 거래를 정지시킬 수도 있네. 물론 어떻게든 자네는 금전적인 문제를 겪게 될 테지만 말이야, 뭐 그런다고 내 탓은 아니니까.”\\n\\u3000이 약간 비꼬는 애정에 감격해 잠깐 동안 이런저런 생각을 하다 나는 “마차를 부르러 사람을 보내도 되나요?”라고 물어보았다.\\n\\u3000“여관이 바로 코 닿을 거리에 있는데 마차는 무슨, 필요 없을 거네.” 라고 그가 말했다. “하지만 자네만 괜찮다면 웨믹(서기, 이름 꼭 외우셔야 합니다. 소설 속 주인공들 중에 한 명입니다.)이 자네와 함께 여 관까지  가줄 것이네.”\\n\\u3000옆방에 있던 그 서기(법률사무원)의 이름이 웨믹인 것을 그때 처음 알았다.\\n\\u3000웨믹이 외출할 동안 대신 자리를 맡아줄 직원을 벨을 눌러 불렀다. 위층에서 다른 직원 한 명이 내려왔다.\\n\\u3000나는 내 후견인(런던 변호사)과 악수를 나눈 후 웨믹과 함께 건물 밖으로 나왔다. 사무실건물 앞에 한 무리의 사람들이 꾸물거리고 있었다. 아까와는 다른 새로운  사람들이었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 웨믹은 그들 사이를 비집고나가며 다음과 같이 차갑게 말할 뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000“말씀드렸지 않았습니까? 이런 다고 아무 소용없다고요. 변호사님은 당신들 중 어느 누구와도 말씀을 나누지 않으실 겁니다.”\\n\\u3000우리는 곧 그들을 뚫고 거리로 나갈 수 있었고 계속해서 나란히 걷기 시작했다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 21장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000함께 걸으며 나는 웨믹 씨(서기=사무원)에게 눈을 돌려 그가 햇볕 아래에서 어떻게 보일지를 살펴보았다. 나는 곧 그가 좀 딱딱한 사람이고 키가 다소 작은 편이고, 사각형 턱에, 가장자리를 무딘 정(돌 깎는 도구)으로 뭉갠 것 같은 얼굴의 소유자라는 것을 알 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000만약 피부를 좀 더 부드럽게 하고 터치를 세밀하게 했더라면 보조개 들이 되었을 수도 있는 상처들이 그의 얼굴에 몇 개 있었다. 하지만  지금은 있는 그대로 그냥 움푹 들어간 얼굴 상처들일뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000조각가가 정으로 그의 코에 장식을 서너 차례 내려다 매끈하게 하지도 못하고 중도에 포기한 것 같은 코를 그는 가지고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그의 와이셔츠 상태가 해어진 것을 보고 그가 독신일거라 판단했다. 그리고 애절한 사연이 있는 여러 번의 사별(친한 사람을 여읨)을 경험해 오고 있는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000그가 적어도 4개가  넘는  애도단추들을  착용하고  있었기  때문이다. 그 중에는 위에 항아리가 놓인 무덤 앞에 ‘수양버들과 여인의 모습’이 그려진 장식 핀도  있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 또한 그의 회중시계 쇠줄에 수 개의 반지들과 도장들이 매달려 있는 것에 주목했는데 그건 마치 고인이 된 친구들에 대한 생각들로 그의 머릿속이 가득한 것 같은 느낌이 들었다.\\n\\u3000작고 날카로우면서도 검은 두 눈동자는 반짝거렸고, 넓지만 얇은 그의 두 입술은 여러 가지 어두운 빛깔의 얼룩이 무늬를 이루고 있었다.\\n\\u3000이러한 모든 정보들을 종합해보건대, 내가 믿는 한에는, 그의 나이가 적어도 4~50세는 되어 보였다. (참고로 주인공의 나이는 18세임)\\n\\u3000“그래서요, 런던에 와 보신 적은 없으신가요?” 웨믹씨(45세)가 내게 물었다.\\n“네, 전혀요.” 내(18세)가  대답했다.\\n\\u3000“저도 한 때는 여기가 처음이었죠.” 웨믹 씨가 말했다. “지금 생각하니 이상야릇하군요!”\\n“지금은 이곳 사정에 정통 하시다는 말씀이군요.”\\n“웬걸요.” 웨믹 씨가 말했다. “그저 돌아가는 정도만 알죠.”\\n\\u3000“이곳이 그렇게 사악한 곳입니까? 런던은 사람 살 데가 아니라고들 하던데요?” 나는 정보를 얻기 위해서라기보다는 뭔가 말을 더 해야 할 것  같아서 물어보았다.\\n\\u3000“사기꾼도 많고, 부정부패도 많고, 살인 사건들도 많이 일어나는 곳이 런던이죠. 하지만 당신에게 그런 몹쓸 짓을 할 사람들은 다른 도시 들에도 많죠.”\\n\\u3000“당신과 그들 사이에 증오가 있을 때만  그렇겠지요.” 내가 그의 말을 좀 더 부드럽게 표현하며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“오~! 저는  증오에 대해 모릅니다.” 웨믹  씨가 되받아쳤다. “런던에서 발생하는 사건사고들엔 증오 따윈 중요치 않습니다. 나쁜 사람들은 범죄로 얻을 게 있으면 그냥 저지르고 보니까요.”\\n“그런 종류의 범죄가 더 나쁜 경우죠.”\\n\\u3000“그렇게 생각하시나요?” 웨믹 씨가 대답했다. “‘우발적 범죄나 고의적 범죄나 둘 다 나쁘다’라고 말씀하셔야죠.” (-_-;;; 해석 정말.. 내가 하면서도 정말 대책 없음. -_- 예전엔 이런 엉뚱한 해석이면 블로그에 올릴 염두도 못 냈는데 이젠 전혀 개의치 않는다는.. 부끄러움이 사라  지고  있는  중  혹은  그런  느낌이랄까~  웨믹  씨가  한  원래  문장은 〈 ‘거의 마찬가지다’, 이렇게 얘기해야 하는 거죠.” 〉 였음. 두둥~) \\n\\u3000웨믹 씨는 모자를 고개 뒤로 살짝 젖히며 곧장 앞만 보고 아주 침착한 태도로 걸어가고 있었다. 마치 그 모습이 이 거리에서는 자신의 관심을 끌만한 것이 하나도 없다는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000우체통 편지 넣는 입구 같이 생긴, 그의 입은 기계적으로 웃고 있는 형상(생김새)이었다. 하지만 나는 우리가 ‘홀본 힐’(언덕)의 꼭대기에 도착하기도 전에 그의 그러한 웃음기가 단지 기계적인 웃는 모습일 뿐 실제 그 자신은 전혀 웃고 있지 않다는 사실을 알게 되었다.\\n\\u3000“메튜 포킷 씨(주인공의 신사교육 담당선생님)의 집을  아시나요?”  내가 웨믹 씨에게  물었다.\\n\\u3000“그럼요.” 그가 특정 방향을 가리키며  고개를 끄떡여보였다. “런던서 부 해머스미스(대장장이란 뜻임) 자치구에  사시죠.”\\n“먼가요?”\\n“글쎄요!

당신은  악수하는  습관이 있으시군요.”\\n\\u3000그 소리에 나는 좀 당황했다. 악수가 런던 최신 유행인 줄 알았었기 때문이다. 그런데 구식인 모양이다. 하지만 나도 곧 상황을 파악하고 “네.”라고 대답했다.\\n\\u3000“전 악수하는 습관을 버린 지 오래됐죠.”라고 웨믹 씨가 말했다. “적어도 최후의 악수를 제외하곤 말입니다. 어쩌죠. 제가 지금 무척 기쁜데 말입니다. 이건 제 생각이지만, 우린 좋은 친구가 될 수 있을 것 같 습니다. 오늘 날씨 정말 좋군요.^^ 그럼 이만 실례하겠습니다.”\\n\\u3000우리들이 악수를 나누고 그가 가버렸을 때, 나는 계단 창을 열려다 하마터면 목이 베일 뻔했다. 창문에 딸린 줄이 섞어 있어 도중에 끊겨 단두대처럼 아래로 “확” 내려왔기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000천만다행인 것은 줄이 너무 빨리 끊어지는 바람에 내가 미처 창문 밖으로 고개를 내밀 수 없었다는 것이다.\\n\\u3000이런 위험천만한 경우를 당한 후, 나는 창문 표면을 희뿌옇게  덮고  있던 먼지들 사이로 보이는 안개 자욱한 여관을 바라보는 것에 만족하고 서 있어야했는데, ‘내가 그동안 런던을 지나치게 과대평가하고 있었던 건 아닐까?’라는 생각이 들어 서글픈 생각이 들었다.\\n\\u3000“곧 돌아오겠음”이란 문구에 나오는 “곧”이라는 단어에 대한 포킷 주니어(2세)의 개념은 내가 생각하는 개념과 많은 차이가 있었다. 나는  근 30분가량을 창밖만 바라보고 서 있자니 거의 미칠 노릇이었다.\\n\\u3000더러운 창문의 모든 창유리에다가 내 이름을 몇 번이고 되풀이해 쓰고 있었다.\\n그때  누군가가  계단  아래에서부터  올라오고  있는  소리가  들렸다. 먼저 그의 모자가 올라오고 고개가 올라오고 목도리가 올라오고 양\\n복 조끼며 바지며 부츠가 올라왔다. 얼추 나와 비슷한 사회적 신분을  지닌 한 사람이 모습을 드러냈다.\\n\\u3000그는 겨드랑이에 종이 봉지를 하나씩 끼고서, 한 손에는 딸기바구니 까지 들고서, 가쁜 숨을 몰아쉬며 내 앞에 서 있었다.\\n“핍 씨세요?” 그가  말했다.\\n“그럼, 포킷 씨?” 내가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“아 이런!” 그가 엄청 미안해하며 말했다. “정말 죄송하게 됐습니다. 시골 발―런던도착 마차가 정오에 있다고 아는 바람에 그  편으로 올라 오실 거라 생각했었거든요. 하지만 제 외출에는 당신  탓도 있습니다.  물론 변명처럼 들리시겠지만, 당신이 시골에서 올라오시니까 식후에 약간의 과일을 드시고 싶어 하지 않을까 생각했었거든요. 그래서 신선한 딸기를 사러 ‘코벤트 가든 마켓(야채시장)’에 다녀왔던 겁니다.”\\n\\u3000어떤 이유에서인가 나는 내 두 눈이 마치 안면에서 튀어나올 것 같은 감정을 느꼈는데, 그 바람에 그의 친절에 대해 횡설수설 “고맙습니 다.”란 인사를 했다. 하지만 머릿속으로는 그가 왠지 낯익어 보여 이게 꿈인지 생시인지 헷갈리고  있었다.\\n\\u3000“이런 맙소사!” 포킷 2세가 소리쳤다.  “문이 달라붙었네요!  원래 좀  잘 안 열렸지만요. 이번엔 좀 심한데요.”\\n\\u3000그는 두 겨드랑이에 종이봉지를 낀 채 잘 열리지 않는 문과 레슬링을 하고 있었는데 그 바람에 딸기가 지금 당장 딸기잼이 될 판이었다. 그래서 “문 열 동안 내가 들면 안 되겠니?”라고 정중하게 부탁했고 그도 내 말투가 웃겼는지 동의의 미소를 지어보이며 종이봉지와 딸기바 구니를 건네주었다.\\n\\u3000모르는 사람이 이 상황을 보았다면 분명 그가 문과 레슬링을 하고 있다고  생각했을 것이다.\\n\\u3000결국 문이 갑자기  열렸다. 그 바람에 그가 비틀거리며 뒤로 물러서다 나와 부딪혔고 나도 그 바람에 비틀거리며 물러서다 반대쪽 문에 부딪혔다. 상황이 웃겨 우리들은 실컷 웃었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 웃는 건 웃는 거고, 그를 쳐다보고 있는 내 눈은 정말이지 얼굴에서 튀어나올 정도였고 나는 그것이 마치 꿈임에 틀림없다고 되뇌고 있었다.\\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000(포킷 2세의 긴 대화 시작. 상당히 긴 내용입니다. “대화 끝”이라는 설명이 있을 때까지 계속 읽으시면 됩니다. 문단 무시~)\\n\\n\\u3000“들어오세요.” 포킷 2세가 말했다. “제가 안내해  드려도 괜찮겠죠. 집이 좀 횅댕그렁한 게 흠이지만 그래도  월요일까진  견디실  겁니다. 물론 제 바램이지만요.^^ 이건 저희 아버지 생각이셨답니다. 내일 하루는 당신이 아버지보다는 저와 보내는 것이 더 기분 좋을 거라 하시 더군요. 그리고 이참에 런던 산책도 시켜주길 바라더군요. 영광입니다. 당신 같은 분에게 런던을 소개시켜드리는 일을 맡게 돼서요.\\n\\u3000식사에 대해 말씀드리자면 그리 나쁘지 않을 겁니다. 인근 커피 하 우스에서 배달해주시기로 약속 되었거든요. 아!

넌! 그때 그 어슬렁거리던 소년이잖니!”\\n\\u3000“그리고 넌.” 내가 말했다. “그때 그 창백한 어린 신사!” (잠깐 앞뒤 설명 : ‘창백한 어린 신사’는 예전에 ‘주인공의 한 방에 나가떨어졌던  그때 그 도련님.’ “11장 #24 ~ #29”에서 관련 내용 참조가능)\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 22장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000창백한 어린 신사와 나는 서로를 응시하며 서 있었다. 곧 우리는 바너드 여관이 떠나갈 정도로 웃음을 터뜨릴 수 있었다.\\n“그게 너였다니!” 그가 말했다. \\n“그게 너였다니!” 내가  말했다.\\n\\u3000그런 후 우린 다시 한 번 서로의 얼굴을 뚫어지게 바라보았고 그 후  다시 한 번 웃음을 터뜨렸다.\\n\\u3000“괜찮은데!” 창백한 어린 신사가 기분 좋게 손을 내밀며 말했다. “그때 그 결투는 이제 다 끝난 일이겠지? 그때 내가 널 케이오시킨 걸 용서해준다면 내겐 큰 아량을 베풀어주는 일이  될  거야.  미안했다,  친 구.”\\n\\u3000이 말을 듣고 나는 ‘허버트 포킷’(주인공들 중 한 명입니다. 물론 주인공은 아니고 중요한 비중을 차지하는 인물들 중 한 명임)이 여전히  그때 그 일을 잘못 기억하고 있다는 것을 유추할 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000난 애써 모른 척 겸손하게 대답했고, 우린 또 한 번 굳게 악수를 나눌 수 있었다. 그는 자신의 이름이 ‘허버트 포킷’이라고 말해주었다.\\n\\u3000“그때만 해도(내가 널 때렸을 때만해도) 아직 유산을 물려받기 전이지?” 허버트 포킷이  말했다.\\n“응.”  내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“사실.” 그도 슬며시 인정하며 말했다. “나도 최근에야 들었어. 내가 가질 줄 알았거든 그 행운 말이야.”\\n“정말?”\\n\\u3000“그래. 미스 해비샴이 나를 부른 이유가 뭔데. 그녀(에스텔라)가 날 좋아할 수 있는지를 보려는 거였지. 여하튼 결과야 그렇게 되었지만 말이야. 그녀는 누굴 좋아할 수도 좌우지간 좋아하지도 않았으니까.”\\n\\u3000이 부분에서 난 “놀라운 얘기구나.”라며 맞장구를 쳐주었는데 잘한  행동 같았다.\\n\\u3000“미스 해비샴의 나쁜 취향이었지.” 허버트가 웃으며 말했다. “사실이 그렇고. 알겠니? 그런 이유로 해서 시험 삼아 날 불렀던 거야. 만약 그때 내가 성공적으로 이겨냈더라면 행운은 내가 물려받았을 걸. 그리고 아마 그렇고 그런 관계가 에스텔라와도 되어 있었을 거고.”\\n“그렇고 그런 관계라니?” 내가 갑자기 진지한 태도로 물었다. \\n\\u3000허버트는 과일을 접시 위에 놓고 있었다. 그러면서  나와 대화를 하다 보니 주의력이 분산돼 말실수를 한 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000“약혼 말이야.” 허버트가 여전히 과일을 깎으며 말했다. “약혼자라든지, 약혼했다 라든지, 뭐였더라? 이름이. 뭐 그런 종류의 단어들 말이야.”\\n“그럼 넌 차였을 때 어떻게 극복했는데?” 내가 물었다.\\n\\u3000“체!” 그가 말했다. “그때 난 별로 상처 입지도 않았었어. 그녀는 다루기  힘든 여자였으니까.”\\n\\u3000“미스 해비샴이?” (미스 해비샴이 허버트와 주인공을  번갈아  가며 부를 때 나이가  37세였음)\\n\\u3000“뭔 소리니! 내가 말한 건 에스텔라였어. 그녀는 정말 매정하고 오만하고 도도하고 변덕이 예측불가능 한 아이였어. 모든 남자들에게 복수를 하기 위해 미스 해비샴이 특별히 양육한 아이었으니까.”\\n“그럼 그녀가 미스 해비샴의 친척이니?” “전혀.” 그가 말했다. “입양했을  뿐이야.”\\n\\u3000“그런데 왜 미스 해비샴이  세상남자들에게 복수를  한다는  건데?  어 떤 복수를 하겠다는  거지?”\\n“오, 이런! 핍 군!” 그가 말했다. “몰랐니?” “뭘?”  내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“아, 이런! 그건 꽤 긴 이야기가 될 거야. 우리의 저녁 식사시간을    모두 채우고도 남는다고. 자 일단 그 문제는 놓아두고, 자 이제 내게도 질문을 할 수 있는 자유를 주시겠습니까? 핍 군. 넌 그 날 미스 해비샴의 저택에 어떻게 해서 오게 된 거니? 그 날 말이야.”\\n\\u3000나는 그에게 미스 해비샴의 저택을 방문하게 된 이유를 설명해주었다. 내 얘기가 끝날 때까지 그는 주의 깊게 듣고 있었다. 그 후 그가  큰 소리로 웃음을 다시 터드리더니 “그럼 나한테서 맞았던 자국들은 어떻게 얼버무린 거니(슬쩍 넘긴 거니)?”라고 말했다.\\n\\u3000나는 “그건 내가 할 소린데.”라고 말하진 않았다. 왜냐하면  따지고  들면 들수록 내가 그를 때린 내 죄의식이 다시 살아날까 싫었고 내가  그를 때린 게 너무나 명백한 사실이었기 때문이다. 비록 그는 정반대로 기억하고 있었지만  말이다.\\n\\u3000“재거스 씨가 네 후견인이라며, 맞니?” 그가 해맑게 얘기를 계속했다.\\n“그래.”\\n\\u3000“재거스 씨가 미스 해비샴의 재산관리인이자 개인변호사라는 사실도 알았니? 그녀는 세상 누구도 믿지 않으면서 오직 재거스 씨한테만은 신뢰를  보낸단다. 알았니?”\\n\\u3000어떻게 된 게 이야기가 진행되면 될수록 답변하기 곤란한 질문들뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000그렇지만 나는 솔직하게  다 말해주었다.  감추고 말고 할 것도  없었다.\\n\\u3000“우리(12살 때)가 미스 해비샴의 저택 뒤뜰에서 결투를  벌인 바로 그날, 난 재거스 씨를 처음 만났어. 하지만 그 날 이후론 단 한 번도 마주친 적도 없었단다. 아마 그 날 나를 봤다는 사실 조차 재거스 씨는 기억하지 못하고 있을  거야.”\\n허버트  포킷이 말했다.\\n\\u3000“친절하게도 재거스 시는 내 아버지에게 너의 가정교사가 되어 달라고 제안하신 분이야. 그걸 제안하려고 직접 찾아오시기까지 했지. 당연히 내 아버지와 미스 해비샴 사이의 관계가 껄끄럽다는 것도 그는 알았을 거야. 내 아버지는 미스 해비샴(갑부)의 사촌이란다. 그렇다고  두  분 사이에 뭔가 친밀한 교류가 있다는 얘기는 아냐. 아버진 아첨꾼이 아니니까, 그녀의 비위를 맞출 생각일랑 처음부터 없으셨고.”\\n\\u3000허버트 포킷은 사람을 끌어당기는 매력이 있었다. 그는 솔직하고 편안했다. 그의 표정과 말투에서도 나는 이를 확인할 수 있었다. 감출 것이 있다거나 치사한 짓을 한다거나 하는 나쁜 능력과는 선천적으로 부적격할 것 같은 인상을 이토록 강하게 내게 각인시킨 인물은 그 전에도 그리고 그 이후로도  없었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그의 태도에서 이상하리만큼 희망적인 어떤 것을 발견했고, 그와 동시에 그가 절대로 성공할 수 없을 거라는 속삭임과 그가 절대 부자가 될  수 없을 거라는 속삭임이 들리는 듯 했다. 어떻게 그런 생각을 품게 되었는지는  모르겠다.\\n\\u3000그 날 저녁 우리가 식사를 하기 위해 자리에 앉기도 전에 나는 이미 이 생각에 물들어 있었다. 하지만 어떻게 해서 내가 이런 생각을 품게 되었는지는 정의할 수  없었다.\\n\\u3000그는 여전히 창백한 얼굴을 한 앳돼 보이는 신사였다. 활기차고 활발한 가운데에서도 그의 주변에는 어떤 정복당한 쇠약함 같은 것이 느껴졌다. 그것은 그가 선천적으로 강하지 못하다는 것을 암시했다.\\n\\u3000그는 잘생긴 얼굴이 아니었다. 하지만 뭐랄까 잘생겼다는 말보다 더 좋은 “몹시 호감을 준다거나 유쾌한 인상을 주는 얼굴”이었다.\\n\\u3000내 주먹 한 방에 나가 떨어졌던 그때나 지금이나 그의 움직임에는 좀 어색한 느낌이 있었다. 하지만 언제까지나 밝고 어려보일 것 같은 모습이기도 했다.\\n\\u3000트랩 씨(주인공의 시골인근읍내의 양복장이)가 만든 시골 양복이 나에게 더 잘 어울릴지 아니면 그가 입었을 때 더 우아하게 보일지는 좀 고민해볼 거리였다. 하지만 나는 확신한다. 녀석은 내가 내 새 양복을 소화하고 있는 것보다 자신의 다소 오래된 의복을 더 잘 소화하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000녀석이 이야기하는 것을 아주 좋아했기 때문에, 내  쪽에서 말을 아끼면 동년배 친구끼리 어울리지 않는 나쁜 태도가 될 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그 결과 나도 내 소소한 얘기들을 해주며 “나는  누가  내 은인인지 묻는 것이 금지되어 있어”란 말을 강조했다.\\n\\u3000더 나아가서 나는 이런 말도 했다. “나는 우리 시골에서 대장장이로 자랐기 때문에 예의범절에 대해선 거의 알지 못해. 만약 내가 당황해 하거나 잘못 행동하고 있는 모습을 볼 때마다 내게 힌트를 준다면 나는 그것을 큰 친절로 여길 테야.”\\n\\u3000“좋고말고.” 허버트 포킷이 말했다. “하지만 내가 예견하건대 너에게 그런 힌트를 줄 필요는 거의 없을 거야. 우린 앞으로 자주 함께 지낼 테니까. 그리고 난 우리 사이에 불필요한 어떤 구속 같은 것도 다 치 워버리고 싶어. 그래서 말인데  부탁하나 해도  될까? 지금부터  나를 부 를 땐 그냥 ‘허버트’라고 불러줄래? 그게 내 세례명이거든.”\\n\\u3000나는 “그래~”라고 말해준 후 앞으론 꼭 “허버트”라고 부르겠노라고 말했다. 나는 또한 “내 세례명은 핍립이야.”라고도 말해주었다. (참고로 주인공의 성 씨는 ‘피립’, 이름은 ‘필립’입니다. ‘1장’ 첫부분을 참고바래요~)\\n\\u3000“필립이라는 네 이름도 난 받아들일 수 없어.” 그가 웃으며 말했다.   “꼭 철자교본(책)에 나오는 교훈적인 소년 같은 인상을 품기거든. 너무 게을러서 연못에 빠진 소년, 너무 비만해서 눈을 덜  수 없었던  소년,  너무 욕심이 많아서 케이크를 꼭꼭 숨겨놓다가 결국 쥐들이 몽땅 그 케이크를 먹어치워 버린 이야기에 나오는 소년, 오기로 새 둥지를 뒤지려 나무에 기어오다 옆에서 자고 있던 곰들을 깨우는 바람에 잡아먹 히고 만 소년 말이야. 내가 괜찮은 애칭(별명)하나 지어 줄께. 들어봐, 우리는 아주 사이가 좋아 그리고 넌 지금까지 대장장이로 일해 왔지, 그러니까 괜찮겠지?”\\n\\u3000“네가 제안하는 어떤 애칭이든 기꺼이 받아들일게.” 내가 대답했다. “하지만 네가 뭘 말하려는지 잘 모르겠는데.”\\n\\u3000“별명으로, 헨델, 헨델 어떠니? ‘게오르크 헨델’(이 소설이 쓰이기 100년 전 영국작곡가)이 작곡한 곡들 중에 〈 즐거운 대장장이 〉 (‘학교 종이 땡땡땡’ 같은 느낌의 곡임)라는 곡이 있거든.”\\n(참고 : 헨델 〈 즐거운 대장장이 〉 를 들을 수 있는 유튜브주소링크  :\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mza-xqk770k\\t,\\t2분짜리\\t피아노 연주 동영상, 검색일자 :  2014-06-15)\\n“오호~ 아주 마음에  드는데.~^^*”\\n\\u3000“그럼, 내 친애하는 헨델.” 그가 문을 열어주면서 뒤돌아보며 말했다. “저의 저녁식사 자리에 납시어주시겠사옵니까? 황송 하옵건대 식탁의 상석에 앉아주시길 간절히 바라나이다. 식대를 내실 분이 당신이 시기 때문이지요.ㅋㅋ”\\n\\u3000나는 그의 말을 듣지 않으려 했고, 그래서 그가 식탁의 상단에 앉고  내가 그를 바라보며  앉았다.\\n\\u3000꽤 괜찮은 식사였다. 내겐 런던 시장 선임 공식연회보다 나았다. 우리를 빙 돌아서 어떠한 연장자도 없이 이런 독립된 환경 속에서 우리 들끼리만 먹는다는 사실이 식사시간을 더 재미나게 했기 때문이다. 게다가 어떤 집시적인 요소가 가미되어 우리의 연회를 더 돋보이게 했다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크 씨(능청스런 잡곡상, 소설 속 개성강한 등장인물)가 만약 우리와 함께 했다면 다음과 같이 말했을 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000“커피하우스에서 공수해온 완전히 가구가 갖추어진 식탁의 편안함과 사치스러움, 그 반면에 식탁 주변 거실 풍경은 비교적 목초가 없고 구린 데가 있는 것 같은 그런 성격의 공간이로다.”\\n\\u3000정리정돈이 되어 있지 않은 거실과 방들 때문에 우린 헤매는 습관이 생겼다. 침대이불들을 바닥 위에 놓아두어야만 했는데 그 바람에 난 거실에서 이불들에 걸려 넘어질 뻔했다. 버터 소스의 일종들은 안락의자 위에 놓아두어야 했으며, 빵은 책꽂이에 놓아두어야했다.  치즈는 ‘난로 옆’ ‘석탄 통 안’에 두어야했으며, 삶은 닭은 옆방에 있는 내 침  대에 놓아두어야 했다. 지저분한 거실과 방들 때문에 쌩쇼를 한 것이다.\\n\\u3000밤이 되어 침대로 돌아왔을 때 나는 내 침대 속에서 굳어 있는 파슬리 잎들과 많은 양의 버터를 발견했을 정도다.\\n\\u3000이 모든 것들이 우리의 연회를 더 기쁘게 했다. 나를 지켜보는 웨이터가 자기 방으로 가자 내 순수한 기쁨은 극대치에 달했다.\\n\\u3000우리가 어느 정도 식사를 했을 때,  나는  허버트에게  “미스 해비샴 얘기 들려주기로 한 거 잊으면 안 돼.”라고 힌트를 주었다.\\n\\u3000“아 깜빡할 뻔했네.”라고 그가 말했다. “대신 이 얘길 하나 해주께(막 나가는 해석-_-). 여담으로 하는 말인데. 헨델(주인공 애칭), 런던에서는 나이프를 입안에 넣지 않아도 된단다. 다칠 수도 있고, 또 그런 용도를 위해 포크가 준비되어 있으니까. 그리고 포크도 필요 이상으로 입 안으로 많이 집어넣을 필요도 없어. 혹시나 해서 하는 말이지만, 대 도시에서는 다른 사람들이 하는 대로 하는 게 제일 무난해. 하나만 더, 손을 위에서 아래로 해서 스푼을 쥐는 것 안 좋단다. 스푼은 아래에서 위로 알겠지? 그렇게 하면 두 가지 이점이 있어. 좀 더 부드럽게 입에  담을 수 있고 그게 스푼의 목적이니까. 그리고 굴(바다에서 나는 굴)을  깔 때 네 오른쪽 팔꿈치를 보다 편안하게 움직일 수 있단다.”\\n\\u3000이런 친절한 에티켓들을 허버트가 그런 활기찬 태도로 제안해주었기 때문에, 서로 얼굴 붉히는 일 없이 우린 또 한 바탕 웃을 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“자.” 그가 계속 말했다. “이제부턴 미스 해비샴에 관한 얘기야. 너도 봐서 알겠지, 미스 해비샴은 버릇없는 아이였데. 어머니는 그녀가 아기였을 때 돌아가셨고, 그래서 그녀의 아버지는 딸이 해달라는 건 뭐든지 해줬지. 아버지는 시골에 넓은 토지를 소유하고 광대한 저택에 거주하는 지방대지주 신사였데, 물론 맥주공장을 경영하고 있었지. 맥 주공장 사장이 되는 게 왜 신사에게 굉장히 좋은 건지 난 모르겠는데 말이야. 점잔을 빼는 신사가 빵을 구울 순 없어도, 영국 최고의 신사가 맥주공장 사장하는 일은 괜찮은 가봐. 부정할 수 없는 실정이지 그런 비슷한 경우가 주변에  흔하니까.”\\n\\u3000“그럼에도 불구하고 신사는 술집 사장이 되어선 안 되는 거 아닐까, 그렇지 않아?” 내가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“어떤 이유에서든 술집만은 안 되지, 당연히.” 허버트가 대꾸했다. “하지만 술집 사장은 되어선 안 되지만, 신사가 술집 단골손님이 되는    건 뭐 봐줄만해. 자! 그래서 그녀의 아버지는 엄청난 부자였고 긍지도 대단하신 신사분이셨단다. 그건 그의 딸도 마찬가지였지.”\\n“미스 해비샴이 외동딸이니?” 내가 용기를 내 물었다.\\n\\u3000“순간정지~!!! 그 얘기를 하려던 참이었거든. 결론부터 말하자면 외 동딸은 아냐. ‘어머니가 다른 오빠’가 한 명 있었다고 하니까. 그녀의 아버지가 남몰래 재혼을 한 경우지, 재혼 상대자가 아마 그의 요리사 였다지.”\\n\\n(잠깐 앞뒤 설명 :  이후  허버트가  설명하는 미스  해비샴의  가족관계\\n\\n\\n와 일련의 사건들이 좀 헷갈릴 수 있습니다. 이 소설을 처음  읽는 경우 반드시 헷갈리게 되어 있는데, 그냥 쭉 읽어나가시면 됩니다. 장편 소설들은 원래 인물 관계를 3~4번 반복해서 작가가 설명해주기 때문 입니다. 잘난 척~^^ 위대한 유산도 그 중 하나임)\\n\\n“긍지가 대단하신 분인 줄 알았는데.” 내가 말했다. \\n\\n(허버트의 긴 대사  시작)\\n\\n\\u3000“오 이런, 그는 긍지가 대단하신 분이셨어. 그러니까 남몰래 재혼한 거지. 그게 그의 자긍심이 대단했다는 증거야. 시간이 지나 그녀(요리 사)도 죽었지. 그녀가 죽자 그는 자신의 딸(미스 해비샴)에게 자신이 재혼했었다는 사실을 털어놓았단다. 그리곤 아들을 가족의 일원으로 받아달라고 말한 후 아들을 자신의 집에서 살게 했단다.\\n\\u3000아들이 자라 청년이 되자 소란을 피우기 시작했어. 터무니없이 비싼 물건들을 마구 사대는가 하면, 누구에게도 고분고분하지 않는 녀석이 었던 거야. 기타 등등 한 마디로 최악이었던 거지. 결국 미스 해비샴의 아버지는 아들의 유산 상속권을 빼앗아버렸데, 하지만 그도 임종이 가 까워왔을 땐, 다시 온화해져 아들에게도 한 미천 단단히 챙겨주었지.\\n\\u3000하지만 아들이 받은 유산은 미스 해비샴이 받은 유산에 비해 택도 없었지(적었지). 포도주 한 잔 더 할래? 미안한데 말이야, 사교계에서는 어느 누구도 상대방이 포도주잔 바닥을 위로 들어 올려 유리잔 가장자리가 코에 닿을 정도로까지 그렇게 엄격하고 양심적으로 마실 것을  기대하진 않는단다.”\\n\\n(허버트의 긴 대사  끝)\\n\\n\\u3000그의 얘기를 너무나도 재밌게 듣다 보니 나는 나도 모르게 그런 행 동들을 하고 있었다. 내가 “지적해줘서 고마워~”라고 말한 후 사과했다.\\n그러자 허버트가 말했다. “천만에, 친구.” 그리곤 얘기를 계속했다. \\n\\n(허버트의 긴 대사  시작)\\n\\n\\u3000“미스 해비샴은 이제 상당한 재산을 상속받은 여성이 되었어, 너도 상상할 수 있겠지만, 미스 해비샴은 그렇게 해서 최고의 신부 감이 되 었단다. 동시에 그녀의 배다른 오빠도 한 미천 단단히 상속받았기 때문에 새로운 삶을 시작할 수 있었지.  하지만 그는 곧 온갖 종류의 빚들과 어리석은 행동들로 인해 또 다시 물려받은 재산을 탕진하고 알거 지가 되었지.\\n\\u3000그와 아버지와의 관계에서보다, 그와 배다른 누나와의 관계에 더 큰 불화가 있었어. 왜냐하면 자신에 대한 아버지의 노여움이 모두 미스 해비샴 때문이라고 생각했던 거지, 그래서 그는  미스  해비샴에  대해 깊고 치명적인 원한을 간직하며 살았던 것 같애.\\n\\u3000이제 이 이야기의 가장 잔인한 치정(남녀 간의 사랑) 부분으로 넘어 가기 전에, 잠깐만 말을 끊을게. 내 친애하는 헨델(주인공 애칭), 식사용 냅킨을 ‘텀블러’(물 컵 큰 거, 스○벅스 커피 잔 같은 거) 안에 넣는  게 아니란다.”\\n\\n(허버트의 긴 대사  끝)\\n\\n\\u3000그때 난 정말로 냅킨을 내 텀블러(큰 물 컵) 입구에 집어넣으려 하고 있었다. 내가 왜 그랬을까? 나도 의문이었다. 나는 다만 이렇게 말할 수 있을  뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000“앗, 나도 방금 알았어. 이 좁은 텀블러 입구 안으로 냅킨을 밀어 넣으려고 혼신의 노력을 다하고 있다니. 왜 이랬지?”\\n\\u3000방금 내 행동이 훨씬 더 괜찮은 일에나 필요한 불굴의 의지임을 시인할 수밖에 없었던 나는 다시 한 번 허버트에게 “알려줘서, 고마워~” 라고 말한 후  사과했다.\\n\\u3000그는 다시 한 번 그 쾌활한 어조로 “천만에, 내가 더 미안하지!”라며 웃어넘겨주었고, 미스 해비샴에 관한 얘기를 계속했다.\\n\\n(허버트의 긴 대사  시작)(상당히 긴 대사입니다~)\\n\\n\\u3000“그때 미스 해비샴에게 구애하는 어떤 남성이 나타난 거야. 경마장에서 혹은 공개 댄스파티 장에서, 혹은 그와 비슷한 장소라면 어디에든 그 남자는 나타났어. 나는 그 사람을 본 적은 없어. 이건 헨델(주인공의 애칭), 너와 내가 태어나기 전에 일어난 일이니까. 꼭 25년 전 일 이지. 내 아버지 말에 따르면 그 자는 남에게 과시하길 좋아하는 야시 꾸리 한 남자였데. 꼭 그런 목적에 걸맞게 생긴 그렇고 그렇게 생긴  남자들 있잖니. 딱 그랬나  봐.\\n\\u3000생김새가 그러니 바보거나 콩깍지가 씌지 않고서야 그 자를 멀쩡한 신사로 오해하는 일은 추호도 없었을 거라고 아버지가 말씀하시더라. ‘마음에서부터 우러나오는 진실 된 신사’가 아닌 남자가 태도에서도 진실 된 신사였던 적은 이 세상이 시작된 이래 단 한 차례도 없었다는 것이 내 아버지의 도덕적  신조니까.\\n\\u3000내 아버지 말씀으로는, ‘니스 칠(목재광내기)을 아무리 한다고 해도 나뭇결을 감출 수는 없다’는 거야. 또한 내 아버지 말로는, ‘니스 칠을 하면 할수록, 나무의 결은 더욱더 돋보인다.’는 거지.\\n\\u3000그건 그렇고. 이 남성은 주구장창 미스 해비샴을 가까이에서 쫓아다 녔고, 온갖 선물공세와 사탕발림들을 내뱉으며 ‘당신에게 헌신하겠다.’ 고 고백했데. 그때까지 미스 해비샴은 사랑에  민감한  감정을  드러낸 적이 없었다는데. 하필 바로 그 몹쓸 남자를 만나고부터 그녀 안에 내 재되어 있던 사랑의 감정들이  폭발한  거지. 결국  미스  해비샴은 그  남자를 사랑하게 되었고 결국 일이 진행되어 그 남자에게 완전히 심취하게 되었어. 당시 그들을 지켜보았던 주변 사람들의 말에 의하면 그랬데.\\n\\u3000그때부터 그 남성은 체계적인 방법으로 그녀의 애정을 이용하기 시작했데. 일은 뻔하지 않니. 그 남자는 미스 해비샴에게서 돈을 야금야금 빌려가기 시작했어. 결국 그의 말에 넘어간 미스 해비샴은 ‘배 다른 오빠가 가지고 있던 맥주공장의  지분(비상장주식)’을  모두  매입하게  돼. 그것도 어마어마한 가격을 지불하면서까지 말이야. 해당 지분은 그 녀의 아버지가 아들에게 남긴 얼마 안 되는 지분이었어. 그러면서 그 남자가 내세운 핑계가 그가 장차 그녀의 남편이 되면 맥주공장 전체 지분을 보유해야만 맥주공장을 잘 운영할 수 있다는 거야.\\n\\u3000네 후견인(재거스 변호사)은 그때까지만 해도 아직  미스  해비샴을 돕고 있지 않았단다, 그녀는 그 당시 너무 거만하고 너무나도 사랑에 심취해 있어서 어느 누구의 충고 따위는 필요치 않았으니까. 또한 충고를 해 줄 수 있었을 그녀의 친척들은 가난하고 하나 같이 뒤로 나쁜 일을 꾸미고 있었지. 내 아버지만 제외하고 말이야. 내 아버지도 마찬 가지로 가난했지만 기회주의적이거나 그녀의 부에 대해서  시기를 하지 는 않았으니까.\\n\\u3000친척들 사이에서 유일하게 올곧던 아버진 미스 해비샴에게 “당신은 지금 그에게 지나치게 많은 일을 해주고 있어. 당신은 지금 그 자의 말을 무조건적으로 신용하고 있어. 모든 것이 너무나 지나치단 말이오.”라고  경고하기에 이르렀지.\\n\\u3000이에 격분한 미스 해비샴은 그 남자가 쳐다보고 있는 자리에서 내 아버지에게 “지금 당장 내 집에서 나가”라고 소리쳤고, 그 이후로 내 아버지는 그녀를 두 번 다시 찾지 않았지.”\\n\\n(허버트의 긴 대사  끝)\\n\\n\\u3000나는 미스 해비샴이 내게 “내가 죽어 저 결혼식 축하연 테이블 위에 누워 있을 때 매튜(허버트의 아버지이름)도 와서 볼 것이다.”라고 말했던  것이 떠올랐다.\\n\\u3000그래서 나는 허버트에게 “혹시 아버지께서 그녀에 대한 분노가 그렇 게도 뿌리 깊으시니?”라고  물어보았다.\\n\\u3000“아니.” 허버트가 말했다. “하지만 그녀는 자기가 남편으로 정한 그 남자가 지켜보는 가운데 내 아버지에게 ‘당신이 왜 이러는지 내가 모를 줄 알아?

시간이  정확히  9시  20분이었을 걸?”\\n\\u3000“그래 정확히 9시 20분이야.” 허버트가 고개를 끄덕이며 말했다. “그녀는 이후 저택 안의 모든 시계들의 시침을 9시 20분에서 멈춰버 렸단다. 편지에 뭐라고 적혀 있었는지는 나도 몰라. 하지만 그 내용이 그녀의 결혼을 비정하게 파탄 냈다는 것만은 확실해. 나도 이 이상은  몰라 그래서 더 말해주고 싶어도 어쩔 수 없구나. 그녀는 이후 사경을 헤매며 앓았고 병에서 회복되었을 때는, 너도 보았다시피, 저택을 황무 지로 방치해두었단다. 그리고 두 번 다시 밖으로 나가지 않았지.”\\n“그게 다니?” 심사숙고한 후 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“응 내가 알고 있는 전부야. 사실 이것도 내가 이야기를 짜맞추어보 고서야 많이 알게 된 거야. 왜냐하면 당사자들 중에 한 명이셨던 내 아버지는 그 얘기를 언급하는 것을 극히 꺼리시거든. 심지어 내가 미스 해비샴의 초대로 그녀의 저택을 방문하게 되었을 때조차도, 내 아 버지는 내가 반드시 알아야할 몇몇 사항들을 제외하고는 여타 문제들에 대해서는 단 한 말씀도 더 하지지  않았으니까. 참, 깜빡하고  얘기  안한게 하나 있긴 해. 미스 해비샴의 사랑을 파탄 낸 그 남성이 실은 처 음부터 끝까지 ”미스 해비샴의,“ 어머니가  다른  ”남동생과  협력했다 “는 사실과 그리고 그 둘 사이에 적어도 어떤 공모가 있었을 거라는 사실과 일이 성공한 후 이득금을 나눠가졌을 거라고 사람들은 생각하고 있어.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 왜 그녀와 결혼해서 재산을 몽땅 다 차지하지 않았지?” 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그가 이미 결혼한 상태였을 수도 있고, 아니면 그녀에게 잔인한 굴욕감을 맛보게 하려는 ‘그녀와 어머니가 다른 남동생’의 계획일 수도 있어.” 허버트가 말했다. “그러니까! 나도 잘 모르겠어.”\\n\\u3000“그 후 두 남자는 어떻게 되었는데?” 허버트의 말을 심사숙고해보던 내가  다시 물었다.\\n\\u3000“그들은 더 깊은 ‘수치심’과 ‘보잘것없는 처지’에 빠져 파멸하고 말았지. 만약 더 빠질 구렁텅이가 있었다면 말이야.”\\n“그래서 그들이 아직 살아있다는 말이니?” “모르겠어.”\\n\\u3000“방금 전에 에스텔라가 미스 해비샴의 친인척이 아니라고 말했잖아, 그냥 양녀라고. 그럼 언제 입양한 건데?”\\n허버트가 어깨를 으쓱해 보이며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“내가 미스 해비샴에 대한 소문을 듣기 시작했을 때부터 에스텔라도 그녀 옆에 항상 있었어. 나도 그 이상은 몰라. 그런데, 헨델.”\\n결국 그가 이 이야기를 그렇게 떨쳐버리고 일어나며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이제 우리는 비밀을 공유하는 완벽한 사이가 되었어. 내가 미스 해비샴에 대해 알고 있는 사실을 너도 이제 모두 알게 되었어.”\\n\\u3000“그리고 내가 알고 있는 사실 모두를 너도 이제 알게 되었고.” 내가 응답했다.\\n\\u3000“나도 전적으로 그렇게 생각해. 그래서 말인데, 너와 나 사이엔 이제 어떠한 경쟁이나 곤란함도 있으면 안 돼. 따라서 나는, 네가 네 행운을 유지할 수 있는 상속조항에 대해, 즉 너에게 유산을 물려 준 은인에  대해 네가 알려 해선 안 되며 지나가는 말이라도 대화의 주제로 삼아서도 안 된다는 그 상속조항 말이야, 그 부분에 대해서라면  너의 친구 로서 신뢰해도 좋아, 나와, 그리고 나와 연관이 있는 어떤 사람들에 의해서도 네 상속조항(나를 알려하지 마라)이 침범당하는  일은  절대로 없을 거야. 실수로라도 그 얘기를 꺼내는 일도 절대로 없을 거야. 약속 할게.”\\n\\u3000실은, 녀석이 그 이야기를 너무나도 우아하게 꺼냈기 때문에, 내가 이제부터 그의 아버지의 가르침을 받으며 수년을 보내야 했음에도 내 상속문제에 관한 여타 문제들은 모두 해결된 것처럼 느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000또한 녀석은 자신의 말에 힘을 주며 매우 의미 있는 듯 그 얘기를  했었기 때문에, 나는 그가 ‘내 은인이 실은 미스 해비샴이라는 사실’을 녀석도 나만큼이나 잘 알고 있을 거라는 인상을 받았다.\\n\\u3000내가 방금까지 깨닫지 못하고 있었던 것이 하나 있는데, 바로  허버트가 우리 사이에 그 문제를 말끔히 해결 짓기 위해 처음부터 그 주제가 나오게 대화를 이끌었다는 것이다. 그 주제를 수면위로 끌어올린 후에야 우리의 관계는 전보다 훨씬 더 정겹고 편안해질 수 있었다. 그 래서 나는 거기에 그의 따뜻한 배려가 있었음을 인식할 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000분위기는 아주 명량해지고 쾌활해졌다. 그래서 대화 도중에  내가  “근데 어디서 일해?(직업)”라고 녀석에게 물었다.\\n“자본가 혹은 선박  보험업자랄까?”\\n\\u3000나는 무심코 거실 주변으로 시선을 돌리며 선박이나 주식 기타 그와 관련된 표식들을 찾아보았다. 내 생각에 그가 이런 내 행동을 본 것 같았다.\\n그가 이런 말을 덧붙였기 때문이다. “런던시내에서 말이야.”\\n\\u3000런던시내에서 선박보험업자들의 중요성과 그들이 벌어들이는 수익에 대해 당시 내가  아주 즐거운  생각들을 가지고 있을 때였다.  그래서  어릴 적에 이 촉망받을 운명을 지닌 어린 보험업자를 한 방에 때려눕히고 눈에 멍이 들게 하고 머리를 쥐어뜯었다는 생각에 일종의 두려움을 느꼈다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그를 처음 만났을 때 든 생각이 다시 떠올랐다. 아무리 봐도 ‘허버트 포킷이 직업세계에서 돈을 벌거나 성공할 수 있을 것 같지 않다’라는 내 독특한 인상 말이다.\\n\\u3000“나는  단순히 선박 보험업에 자본을 대는 것에만 머무르지 않을 거야. 괜찮은 생명 보험 주식들도 소량 구입해서 다양한 곳에 재투자해볼 생각이야. 그리고 광산업에도 진출해볼 생각도 좀 있고. 하지만 이 모두는 내가 선주로부터 몇 천 톤의 선박 전부나 혹은 일부를 임차해  내 계정으로 그 배들을 운용하는 것을 방해하지는 못할 거야. 무역에도 손을 대볼  생각이거든.”\\n그가 자신의 의자에 편하게 등을 기대며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“동인도(실제의 인도)로 가서, 비단이며, 여성용 어께걸이 숄이며, 향미료들이며, 염료들이며, 신기한 약초들이며, 그리고 값비싼 목재들을 사고팔 생각이야. 이것들은 대단히 흥미로운 사업이 될 거야.”\\n“그럼 이윤이 엄청나겠구나?” 내(25세)가 물었다. “어마어마하고말고!” 그(25세, 허버트)가  말했다.\\n\\u3000나는 다시 한 번 마음이 흔들렸다. ‘그가 나보다 더 큰 재산을 모으 겠구나.’라는 생각이 들기 시작했기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000“나는 또한 서인도(미국 밑에 있는 섬들)로도  사업을 확장할거야.” 그가 두 엄지손가락을 두 조끼 호주머니들 속에 집어넣으면서 말했다. “그곳에서 사탕수수며, 담배, 그리고 럼주를 교역할거야. 실론 섬(스리 랑카, 인도 옆에 있는 섬)에서는 코끼리 상아(어금니)를 교역할거고.”\\n“그러려면 상당수의 선박들이 필요하겠네?” 내가 물었다. “선단 하나(배 30~90척)는 족히 필요할 걸.” 그가 말했다.\\n\\u3000이 무역의 엄청난 스케일에 깊이 감동한 나는 그에게 “너와 보험 계약을 맺은 선박들이 현재 대부분 어디와 거래하고 있니?”라고 물어보기에 이르렀다.\\n\\u3000“나는 아직 보험 증서 발행을 시작하지 않았어.” 그가 응답했다. “여기저기 알아보며 돌아다니고 있는 중이야.”\\n\\u3000어쩐지, 이러한 이야기 전개방식은 바너드 여관(곰팡내 나고 쓰러지기 전의 여관)과 일맥상통하는 것 같았다. 나보다 더 말이다. 이 뜻밖의 대답에 그만 맥이 빠진 내가 “허!”하며 탄식했다.\\n\\u3000“내가 가는 회계사무실이 한 곳 있는데, 그곳에서 여기저길 알아보며 돌아다니고 있는  중이야.”\\n“보수가 좋은 곳이니?” 내가  물었다.\\n\\u3000“그곳에서 근무하는 젊은 사람들이 수익이 많으냐고?” 그가 도리어 내게 물었다.\\n“어? 그게 그러니까, 너에게  말이야.”\\n\\u3000“나? 나는 아냐. 나는 수익이 없어.” 그가 주의 깊게 더하고 수치를 결산하는 듯 한 태도를 취하며 이렇게 말했다. “내게는 아직 직접적인 수익이 없어. 말하자면, 회계사무실이 내게 보수를 지불하지는 않아. 지금은 내 스스로, 내 스스로 해나가야 해.”\\n\\u3000이것은 확실히 수익성이 있는 모습이 아니었다. 그런 소득원천(돈 벌 계획만 기지고 있고 실행할 여건이 안 되어 있는 것)으로는 막대한 자본을 축적하기가 어려울 것이라는 암시를 내(주인공, 25세)가 마치 하려는 듯 고개를  흔들었다.\\n\\u3000“하지만, 하지만 중요한 것은.” 허버트 포킷(주인공들 중 한 명, 25 세)이 말했다. “내가 여기저기 알아보며 돌아다니고 있다는 거야. 이건 정말 엄청난 거라고. 내가 회계사무실에 나가고, 그러니까, 거기서 여기저길 알아보며 돌아다닐 수 있다는 건 말이야.”\\n\\u3000그의 말은 내게 ‘만약 회계사무실에서 벗어나 있으면 여기저길 알아 보며 돌아다닐 수 없다는 말인가?’라는 이상한 인상을 심어주는 말이 었다. 하지만 그의 의견을 존중해 잠자코 있었다.\\n\\u3000“그러다 때가  오는 거지.” 허버트(25세)가 말했다. “네 앞길이  열리는 그런 좋은 기회 말이야. 그럼 안으로 들어가서 이렇게 움켜쥐면 돼. 그런 후 자본을 축척하면 되고, 그런 다음에는 ‘여기 있어요!’라고 외치면 상황 끝이지. 자본이란 일단 한 번만 축척되고 나면 스스로 돈이 돈을 굴리기 때문에 네가 따로 신경 쓸 일은 없어.”\\n\\u3000이것은 미스 해비샴의 정원에서 우리가 처음 만났을 때 그가 보인 태도와 너무나도 일치했다. 아주  일치했다.\\n\\u3000자신의 가난을 이겨내는 그의 태도 역시 나와의 싸움에서 패한 후 그가 보인 받아들임 태도와 정확히 일치했다.\\n\\u3000그는 예전에 내 주먹에 나가 떨어졌을 때 보인 방식대로 현재 자신이 처해 있는 온갖 역풍과 타격에 대처하고 있는 듯 했다.\\n\\u3000증거가 있었다. 그는 자기 주변에 최소한의 필수품을 제외하고는 아 무것도 가지고 있지  않았다.\\n\\u3000내가 이렇게 말할 수 있었던 이유는, 내가 주목한 모든 것들이 결국 커피하우스에서 나를 위해 보내준 것이거나 또는 그 밖의 장소들에서 보내온 것으로 판명 났기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000자신의 마음속에 이미 한 미천 마련해 놓고 있었기 때문에 그가 허세를 부릴 만 했지만 그는 자신이 잘났다고 우쭐해 하지 않았고 그래서 나는 그에게 고마움을 느꼈다.\\n\\u3000그것은 그의 몸에서  자연스레  배어나오는  상냥한  마음씨와  더해져 또 다른 즐거움을 주었고 그래서 우린 아주 사이가 좋아졌다.\\n\\u3000저녁때가 되자 우리는 잠깐 산책을 할 겸 거리로 나가, 반(1/2)값만  내고 극장에 들어가 보기도  했다.\\n\\u3000그리고 다음날 우리는 웨스트민스터 대성당(런던에 있는 유명한 성당, 잘 아시겠지만^^)에 예배 보러 갔으며, 오후에는 그 근처 공원들을 돌아다니며  산책을 했다.\\n\\u3000나는 궁금했다. ‘저 많은 말들의 말굽은 누가 다 달아주었을까? 조 (주인공의 매형, 대장장이)가 달면 좋을 텐데.’\\n\\u3000줄잡아 계산해도 그 주의 일요일(런던 상경 후 1주일 경과)이 내겐 조(매형)와 비디(여자이름)를 떠난 지 수개월은 되는 듯이 보였다. 나와 그들 사이에 놓인 공간은 이런 확장의 성질을 띠고 있었다. 우리  고향에 있는 습지대까지의 거리도 확연한 차이를 보이며 멀어져 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 교회 갈 때 입던 낡은 옷들을 챙겨 입고서 마을의 낡은 교회로 갈 수 있었던 것이 바로 지난주 일요일이었다. 이 짧은 시간의 경과에 대한 인식은 지리학적으로나 사회관계적으로도  결합이  불가능해보였다. 그건 햇볕에 의해서도 달빛에 의해서도 조합이 불가능했을 것이다.\\n\\u3000희미한 과거에 대한 내 기억의 일그러짐에도 불구하고, 사람들로 넘쳐나고 온갖 조명들로 화려하게 빛나고 있는 “런던거리에는,” 내가 불쌍한 우리 집 부엌을 아주 멀리 떨어뜨려놓고 왔다는 것에 대한 죄책감에 나를 의기소침하게 하는 “암시들이 있었다.”\\n\\u3000그리고 모두가 잠든 “한밤중에는,” 몸을 제대로 가누지 못해 약간 사기꾼 같은 발자국 소리를 내는 수위가 불침번을 선답시고 여관 주변을 서성이며 “발자국 소리를 내고 있었다.”\\n이 모든 것들이 내 마음을 공허하게 만들고 있었다. \\n\\u3000월요일 아침 8시 45분이 되자, 허버트 포킷(25세)이 회계사무실에 나가보겠다며 알리러 왔다. 아마 여기저기 알아보기 위해 주변을 살피러 회계사무실에 나가보겠다는 의미인 것 같았다. 내 생각에, 그러니까 나도 약간 지루하던 참이라 그와 동행하게 되었다.\\n\\u3000일단 한 시간 내지 두 시간 후에 그가 다시 나와 나를 데리고 해머 스미스(런던중앙부, 템즈 강 옆)로 가기로 했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 나는 그의 일이 끝나길 기다리고 있었다. 이곳은 젊은 보험 업자들이 껍질을 깨고 밖으로 나올 알들이 온통 먼지와 열기 속에서 배양되고 있는 곳 같았다. 타조 알처럼 말이다.\\n\\u3000이제 막 사회에 진출한 것 같은 이들 거인들이 월요일 아침에 들어가고 있는 장소들을 보고 판단해보건대 그런 생각이 들었다.\\n\\u3000허버트(25세)가 도와주고 있는 회계사무실 건물에서는 이 주변 광경이 제대로 보이지 않았다. 사무실은 2층 뒷마당에 위치해 있었는데 여기저기 때가 묻고 더러운 장소였다. 옆 건물 2층 뒷마당과 또다시  접해 있었다. 여기서 주변 광경을 살피느니 차라리 밖으로 나가 여기 저기 직접 돌아다녀 보는 게 나을 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000나는 정오 때까지 특별히 하는 일 없이 마냥 기다리고 있다가 런던 증권거래소에 들어가 보았다. 그곳에서 나는 솜 부스러기(매트리스 안에 넣는 거) 같은 남성들이 선박 광고지 아래에 옹기종기 앉아 있는 모습들을 보았다.\\n\\u3000나는 그들이 대상인들이 틀림없다고 생각했다. 그런데 왜인지 그들 모두는 하나같이 기가 죽어 있어 의아했다.\\n\\u3000정오가 되자 허버트가 나왔다. 우리는 유명한 커피하우스로 가 점심 식사를 했다. 그때 나는 그 곳을 아주 높게 평가했었는데, 지금 와서 생각해보니, 그곳이 유럽에서도 가장 품격이 떨어지는 커피하우스였음을 인정하지 않을 수  없다.\\n\\u3000심지어  그때도 그랬지만, 그곳은 “육즙이” 스테이크 안쪽보다  식탁보 위나 나이프나 웨이터들의 유니폼 위에 더 많이 ”묻어 있는 곳이었다.”\\n\\u3000나는 굳이 이 가벼운 점심을 알맞은 가격에 해치웠다고 말하고 싶은데, 그 이유는 가격에 포함되지 않았던, 굳어 있던 그 동물성 기름들을 생각했을  때 말이다.\\n\\u3000어쨌든 점심을 그렇게 해치운 후 우린 바너드 여관으로 가 내 작은  여행 가방을 들고 다시 나왔다. 그리곤 대형 사륜마차(바퀴 4개)를 빌려 해머스미스(런던 중앙부, 템즈 강 옆에 있는 런던의 자치구 중 하나)로 향했다.\\n\\u3000그곳에 도착해보니 시간이 어느덧 오후 2시 내지는 3시쯤  되어 있었다. 그곳에서부터 포킷 씨의 집까지 잠시 걸어갔다. 아주 금방이었다.\\n\\u3000정문의 빗장이 들리고 우린 강이 내려다보이는 작은 정원으로 곧장 들어갈  수  있었다.  그곳에서는  포킷  씨의  아이들(허버트의  아주 어린 남녀형제들)이 뛰어 놀고  있었다.\\n\\u3000내 이해관계와 선입관과 이토록 분명한 관계가 없는 부분에 대해 내가 내 자신을 기만하지 않고 말한다면, 내가 보았을 때 포킷  씨 부부의 아이들은 보살핌을 받으며 성장하거나 양육되고 있는 것이 아니라, 말 그대로 고꾸라지듯이 뛰어다니며 크고 있었다.\\n\\u3000포킷 씨 부인은 나무 아래에 있는 정원 의자에 앉아 책을 읽고 계셨    다. 다리 한 짝을 또 다른 정원 의자 위에 올려놓으신 채 말이다.\\n부인의 두 하녀들이 아이들이 뛰어 노는 것을 챙기고 있는 듯 했다. “엄마.” 허버트가 말했다. “이 분이 핍 씨야.”\\n포킷 씨 부인은 상냥하고 품위 있는 태도로 내 인사를 받으셨다. “앨릭(‘알렉산더’란  의미임,  애칭임)  도련님!  제인  아가씨!”  하녀들\\n중 한 명이 두 아이에게 소리치고 있었다. “그렇게 덤불(엉클어진 수풀) 가까이에서 펄쩍 뛰시면 강물 속으로 구르실지 몰라요. 큰 일 나신다고요. 그럼 파파(아빠)가 뭐라 하시겠어요?”\\n\\u3000그와 동시에 이 보모(아이돌보미)는 포킷 씨 부인의 손수건을 주워주며  이렇게 말했다.\\n“벌써 여섯 번째에요,  마님!”\\n그러자 포킷 씨 부인이 웃으며 말했다. “고마워, 플롭슨.”\\n\\u3000그녀가 다리 한 짝을 의자에서 내리고 한 쪽 의자에만 앉더니 다시  책을 읽기 시작했다. 그 즉시 그녀는 몰두하며 이맛살을 찌푸렸다. 그건 마치 지난 1주일 동안 책 읽기를 계속해온 것 같은 얼굴표정이었다.  거짓 같았다.\\n채 여섯 줄도 다 읽기 전에 그녀가 내게 시선을 고정시키며 말했다. “그래 어머님께서는 몸성히 잘 계시지?”\\n\\u3000이 뜻밖의 질문에 난 너무 당황해서 이차에 맞지 않는 엉뚱한 말을 해대기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000“넷? 그런 분이 계시다면 분명 그 분도 잘 계실 거예요. 그리고 이 렇게라도 안부를 물어주신 친절에 대해 아주 감사해하실 거고 부인께 찬사를 보내는 걸 잊지  않았을….”\\n\\u3000그때 보모가 다가오는 바람에 나는 가까스로 그 질문에서 벗어날 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“어머!” 보모가 네모지고 작은 손수건을 집어 들며 소리쳤다. “벌써 일곱 번째 세요. 오늘 오후에 마님이 하시는 짓 좀 보세요, 넵!”\\n\\u3000포킷 씨 부인이  손수건을  받았다.  그녀가  처음에  지어보인  표정은 그 손수건을 생전 처음 본다는 표정 그래서 그녀 자신은 지금 말로 표현할 수 없을 만큼 놀라고 있다는 표정이었다. 그런 다음 그녀는 자기 손수건임을 인정하는 웃음을 지어보이며  말했다.\\n\\u3000“고마워, 플롭슨.” (플롭슨은 딱 한 번밖에 안 나오는 이름임. 독자가 몰라도 되는  이름임)\\n그러더니 나를 잊은 채 또 다시 책을 읽기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000나는 이제 뛰어놀고 있는 아이들을 세어볼 여유가 생겼다. 다양한 연령대의 포킷(성씨)들이 뛰어다니고 있었는데 최소 여섯 명은 되어보 였다.\\n\\u3000내가 여섯을 다 세리기도 전에 일곱 번째 아이의 울부짖는 소리가 공중을  가르며 들려왔다.\\n\\u3000“아기가 집안에 있는 거 아니니!” 플롭슨(여자보모)이 말했다. 그녀에겐 그것이 정말 놀랍다는 표정 같았다. “얘 서둘러, 밀러스.” (밀러스는 딱 한 번밖에 안 나오는 이름임. 독자가 몰라도 되는 이름임)\\n\\u3000밀러스는 또 다른  보모 이름이었다. 밀러스가 집안으로 들어갔다. 차츰 아이의 울부짖는 목소리가 가라앉더니 이내 뚝 그쳤다. 마치 어린 복화술사(입을 안 움직이고 멀리서 말하는 것처럼 말하는 사람)가 입안에 뭔가를 물고 있는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000포킷 씨 부인은 그때까지도 책에 열중하고 있었다.  나는 그녀가 읽고 있는 책이 어떤 내용인지 알고 싶은 호기심이 강하게 생겼다.\\n\\u3000내 생각에 우리(주인공과 허버트)는 기다리고 있었던 것 같다. 포킷 씨(허버트 포킷의 아버지, 주인공의 신사교육 담당 개인교사)가 우리를 맞으러 정원까지 내려오길 말이다. 어쨌든 우리는 거기서(정원) 계속 기다렸다.\\n\\u3000곧 나는 주목할 만한 가족적 현상을 관찰할 기회를 가지게 되었는데, 어느 아이든 간에 그 아이가 놀다가 자기도 모르게 제 위치를 벗어나 포킷 씨 부인 곁으로 다가가게 되면, 아이들이 매번 발을 헛디디다 매번 포킷 씨 부인에게 걸려 넘어진다는 사실이다.\\n\\u3000그럼 그녀는 순간 깜작 놀라하고, 그녀에게 걸려 넘어진 아이들은 오랫동안 통탄의 울음을 터뜨리고  있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 놀라운 정황(상황)을 어떻게 이해해야 할지 몰랐다. 그래서 이것을 이해해보기 위해 나름 심사숙고해보지 않을 수 없었다. 머지않아 밀러스(보모이름, 이름 알 필요 없음)가 아기를 안고 내려왔는데 그 때까지 난 생각에 잠겨  있었다.\\n\\u3000플롭슨(보모이름, 이름 알 필요 없음)이 아기를 넘겨받았다. 플롭슨이 아기를 포킷 씨 부인에게 안겨주려다, “플롭슨이 아기와 함께” 머리부터 거꾸로 포킷 씨 부인에게로 넘어가는 것을 “허버트(포킷 씨 부인의 아들, 25세)와 내가 가까스로 붙잡았다.”\\n\\u3000“이거 참 야단났군, 야단났어, 플롭슨(보모이름, 엑스트라)!” 포킷 씨 부인(엑스트라, 알 필요 없는 이름임)이 잠시 책에서 눈을 떼고 말했다.  “모두가 넘어지다니!”\\n\\u3000“어머나 세상에, 마님!” 플롭슨이 얼굴이 시뻘겋게 되더니 말했다. “거기 뭐가 있는  거애요?”\\n“여기 뭐가 있나니, 플롭슨?” 포킷 씨 부인이 물었다.\\n\\u3000“아니 그럼 그게 발 올려놓는 발판이 아니고 뭐예요!” 플롭슨이 소 리쳤다. “그걸 스커트 아래에 놓아두시니까 사람들이 다 넘어지는 게 아네요? 자, 아기부터 받으세요, 마님, 책은 제게 주시고요.”\\n\\u3000포킷 씨 부인은 충고대로 책을 보모에게 건넸다. 다른 아이들이 아기 주위에서 노는 동안 그녀가 아기를 무릎 위에 앉히고 서투른 솜씨로  아기를 달랬다.\\n\\u3000그녀의 관심이 아주 잠깐 동안 지속되었다. 그때 포킷  씨  부인이  “얘들 데리고 들어가 낮잠부터 재워라.”라며 별 애정 없이 말했다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 첫 번째 방문에서 이미 두 가지 발견을 다 했다. 첫 번째는 아까 말했고, 두  번째는  어린  ‘포킷’(부모님  성씨)들의 양육방식이 단지 ‘꼬꾸라지듯 뛰는 것’과 ‘눕는 것’ 이 두 가지의 반복이라는 것이다. 플롭슨과 밀러스(모두 보모 이름들, 독자가 알 필요 없는 이름들임) 이 아이들을 데리고 집안으로 들어갔다. 그 모습이 마치 어린 양떼들\\n을 몰고 들어가는 듯  했다.\\n\\u3000이런 제반사정으로 인해, 막상 포킷 씨가 나를 마중하기 위해 밖으로 나왔을 때, 나는 그의 당황하는 얼굴표정들이며 회색이 다된 그의 머리카락들이며 빗질이 되어 있지 않고 아주 흐트러져 있는 그의 머리 모양을 보고도 별로 놀라지도 않았다.\\n\\u3000그의 얼굴표정들을 보건데 그는 이 모든 사항을 정리할 방도를 전혀 찾지 못하고 있는 듯 보였다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 23장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000“만나서 반갑네.” 포킷 씨가 말했다. “나를 만난 것이 유감스럽지 않게  되길 바라네.”\\n그가 마치 내 동갑내기 같은 미소를 지어보이며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“자네도 알게 되겠다시피, 난 자네가 놀랄 만큼 사회적 지위가 높은 사람이 아니네.”\\n\\u3000그는 젊어보였다. 비록 그가 지금 내 앞에서 방금 전 상황들 때문에 곤혹스러워하고 있고 머리카락이 완전 백발이 되어 있었지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000분명 그의 말투와 태도에는 꾸밈없는 데가 있었다. 내가 굳이 연장 자에게 꾸밈없다고까지 말한 것은 그가 자연스럽게 나를 대해주었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그래도 솔직히 말한다면, 그가 당황해하고 있는 모습에는 약간 코믹한 구석도 있었다. 만약 그 자신이 “나는 매우 산만하다”라는 것을 모른다면 지금 이 상황은 큰 웃음을 자아낼 만큼 코믹한 상황이었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그는 나와 약간 담소를 나눈 뒤 두 미간을 약간 찌푸리며 아내에게 말했다.\\n“벨린다(독자가 알 필요 없는 이름임), 핍 군을 잘 맞아주었겠지?” 그는 검고 잘 생긴 두 눈썹을 가지고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그러자 그녀가 책에서 눈을 떼 남편을 올려다보며 “그럼요.”라고 말한 후 나를 바라보며 영혼 없는 미소를 날렸다.\\n그녀가  내게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“‘오렌지 플라워 워터’(등화수, 오렌지 꽃에서 채취해 증류시킨 향료)의 맛이 어떻게 취향에 맞으셨는지 모르겠네요?”\\n이 질문은 앞서의 대화나 이후의 대화내용과는 하등의 관계가 없는 생뚱맞은 대화였으며, 지금 우리가 나누고 있는 주제와도 전혀 동 떨어지는 말이었다.\\n\\u3000그건 그녀가 별로 깊이 있게 생각하지 않고 그냥 겉치레로 내뱉은 말임을 의미했다. 그녀가 이전에 보인 태도와도 부합했다. 그냥 애정  없는  대화용 생색내기였다.\\n\\u3000나는 몇 시간 지나지 않아 한 가지 사실에 주목하게 되었다. 여기서 꼭  밝히고 싶다.\\n\\u3000‘포킷 씨 부인’(허버트의 어머니)이 실은 아주 우연히 고인이 된 어떤 기사(정확히 말하자면 기사가 아니라 ‘나이트 작위’임, 헷갈리실까봐 그냥 기사로 해석함~)의 외동딸이라는 사실이다.\\n\\u3000또한 ‘포킷 씨 부인의 아버지’는 돌아가신 자기 아버지(포킷 씨 부인의 할아버지)가 준남작(기사와 남작의 중간 작위이지만, 귀족은 아님) 의 작위에 오르게 되어 있었는데, 국왕폐하의 개인적인 변덕이라든지, 수상의 개인적인 변덕이라든지, 혹은 대법관의 개인적인 반대, 또는 캔 터베리 대주교의 개인적인 염려내지는 기타 그럴만한 위치에 있던 어느 누군가의 악의적이고 개인적인 반대에 의해 그만 준남작의 작위를  받지 못했다는 것이다. 사실 나도 반대한 사람이 누군지 포킷 씨 부인 에게서 듣긴 했는데 지금은 생각이 안 난다.\\n\\u3000누가 봐도 분명 가정일 뿐인 이 것을 근거로 들어서 ‘포킷 씨 부인 의 아버지’는 자신의 이름을 스스로 영국 귀족장부에 덧붙였던 것이다. 내 생각에, 그(포킷 씨 부인의 할아버지)가 아마 어떤 건물공사에서 혹은 기타 그와 비슷한 다른 신축공사에서 첫 돌을 놓을 때 즈음해서, 펜 촉으로 영어문법을 강타함으로써 피지(송아지 가죽) 위에다가 발악 하는(감동적인-_-) 연설을 또박또박 큰 글씨로 적시하여(써서) 기사 작위를 받았거나, 혹은 착공식에서 명망 있는 어떤 왕실 사람에게 자신의 흙손(도구) 또는 모르타르(=시멘트+물+모래) 이 둘 중 하나를 양\\n보한  대가로  얼렁뚱땅  기사  작위를  받게  되었던  건  아닌지  싶다. 어쨌든 그런 연고로 해서 ‘포킷 씨 부인의 아버지’는 딸(포킷 씨 부\\n인)이  필연적으로  ‘작위가  있는  젊은이’와  결혼해야할  여성으로 그리고, 천한 가사노동에 대해 배워야할 필요가 없을 만큼 철저히 보호받아야 될 여성으로 양육되게 딸이 요람(아기)에 있을 때부터 지도하고 관리했던 것이다.\\n\\n\\u3000(노코멘트 : 정말 150년 전에 돌아가신 분이라지만, 디킨스 이런 식으로 사람 골탕 먹이는 문장 사용하면 안 됨~_!!! 뭔 말인지 하나도 모르겠음. 사전보고 해석은 했는데 뭔 말인지 모르는데 올리게 되었음. “…는데,  …는데,  …는데,  …는데,”  이런  식의  문장  정말.. -_-. 23장의 단락이랑 그 앞 단락 너무 낯선 문장이었음. 낯설었음. 소설 초반에도 엄청 말을 꼬아서 하더니 소설 중간에 또 다시 시작하는 것 같은 예감...-_-+ 정말 당시에도 사람들이 이해했을까?

그리고 저 많은 아이들이 태어날 때 누군가 다른 사람의 집으로 보내지지 않았는지?를 자신은 도무지 이해할 수 없다는 표정 같았다.\\n그러더니, 냉담한  말투로  아이들에게  질문을  몇  던졌다. “꼬맹이 조(이름)야, 옷 주름 장식에 왜 구멍을 달고 다니지?” \\n“파파(아빠), 플롭슨(여자보모)이 시간 나면 고쳐 준댔어요.”\\n\\u3000“어린 패니(여자아이이름)야, 손가락 끝에 난 곪은 종기는 어쩌다 생긴 거니?”\\n\\u3000“파파, 밀레스(여자보모)가 깜빡하지 않을 때 찜질 약을 발라 준댔어요.”\\n\\u3000그러자 포킷 씨의 냉담한 태도가 누그러져 차츰 아버지의 다정함으로 바뀌었다. 아버지의 정이 되살아난 포킷 씨가 아이들에게 2만 원씩을 주며 “나가 놀 거라!”라며 다정하게 말했다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 아이들이 나가는 동안, 자신의 머리카락 사이로 두 손을 집어넣어 자신을 들어 올리려는 아주 강력한 시도를 한 번 더 한 다음, 자신의 머릿속에 있던 이 절망적인 주제(이 많은 아이들이 왜 하필 내 집에 태어났지?)를 말끔히  떨쳐버렸다.\\n\\u3000저녁에 강에서 조정(수상스포츠)이 있었다. 드러믈(주인공의 라이벌)과 스타톱(그냥 주인공의 친구, 아주 친하지는 않음, 약간 엑스트라 느낌의 조연)도 자기 보트가 하나씩 있었기 때문에, 나도 내 보트를 하나 마련해 그들 모두를 앞지를 결심을 했다.\\n\\u3000다년간의 시골생활로 단련된  몸이기  때문에  나는  대다수의  운동을 꽤 잘했다. 하지만 다른 강들까지는 아니더라도, 적어도 템스 강이 요구하는 우아한 노 젓기 자세가 내게 부족하다는 정도는 나도 알고 있었기 때문에, 나는 즉시 1인 조정경기 우승자에게서 개인지도를 받는  일에 착수했다. 그가 우리 선착장에서 부지런히 오고가고 있었기 때문에 나는 내 새 동료들의 소개를 받아 그에게 개인지도를 받게 되었다.\\n\\u3000이 실습강사는 “자네는 마치 대장장이 같은 팔을 가지고 있군.”라고 말을 해 나를 정말로 당황하게 만들었다.\\n\\u3000만약 그가 그 찬사 한 마디 때문에 하마터면 자신의 제자(주인공)를 잃을 수도 있었다는 사실을 알았더라도 그 말을 했을는지 의문이다.\\n\\u3000밤이 되서 집(포킷 씨의 집)에 돌아와서 보니 우리를 위해 저녁상이 차려져 있었다. 열심히 움직였으니 우린 편안히 저녁식사를 즐길 이유가 있다고 생각했다. 하지만 다소 불쾌하고 마음에 내키지 않는 집안  일이  하나 발생했다.\\n\\u3000우리가 집에 돌아왔을 때 포킷 씨는 기분이 좋았다. 그때 식모가 들 어오더니  그에게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이런 말씀 드려도 될까요, 나리. 긴히 드리고 싶은 말씀이 있는데 말이죠.”\\n\\u3000“내가 있는데서 남편에게 직접 말하겠다고?” 포킷 씨 부인이 내면에 감추어져 있던 그 귀족의 자태를 뽐내며  위엄  있게  말했다. “어떻게 그런 어처구니없는 생각을! 가서 플롭슨(여자보모)에게 먼저 말하게. 그래도 안 되면 나중에 따로 내게 얘기하고.”\\n\\u3000“마님껜 용서를 빌게요.” 식모가 대꾸했다. “꼭 나리께 지금 알려드려야할  것 같아서요.”\\n\\u3000이 결과로서 포킷 씨가 방에서 나가게 되었다. 우리는 그가 돌아올 때까지 즐거운 시간을 보내고  있었다.\\n\\u3000“정말 예뻐 죽겠군! 벨린다(허버트의 어머니)!” 방으로 다시 돌아온 포킷 씨가 비탄과 절망에 찬 얼굴 표정을 지어보이며 말했다. “요리사가 지금 술에 취해 인사불성이 된 채 부엌 바닥에 누워  있소. 신선한  버터 큰 묶음은 찬장에 들어박힌 채 그리스(기계의 윤활유)로 팔릴 준 비를  하고 있고!”\\n\\u3000포킷 씨 부인은 남편의 이 자조 섞인 말에 즉시 붙임성 있는 태도를 보이며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이게 다 저 미운 소피아(여자 식모이름, 한번 밖에 안 나오는 이름 임)가  한 짓이에요!”\\n“아니 그게 무슨  소리요,  벨린다?”  포킷  씨가  강력히  물었다. “소피아가  방금  당신보고  말했잖아요,  긴히  할  말이  있다고.” 포킷\\n씨 부인이 말했다. “전 다 들었단 말예요. 소피아가 방으로 들어와 당신보고 할 말이 있으니 같이 가 달라고 말하는 걸 이 눈과 귀로 다 들었단 말예요. 제가 못 본 줄 아세요?”\\n\\u3000“하지만 그 애(식모)는 단지 나를 아래층으로 데려가 요리사와 버터 묶음을 보여준 것뿐이지 않소?” 포킷 씨가 되물었다.\\n\\u3000“왜 그 애를 변호하죠, 매튜(‘매튜’는 이름, ‘포킷’이 성).” 포킷 씨 부인이 정색을 하며 말했다. “이간질시킨 건 그 애였잖아요? 모르시겠어요?”\\n포킷 씨가 끙끙 앓는 신음소리를 내고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“할아버지의 손녀인 제가 이 집에서 아무것도 아닌  존재란 말인가요?” 포킷 씨 부인이 말했다. “게다가, 요리사(여자)는 아주 다정하고 공손한 여자였단 말이에요.  그녀가  직장(요리사)을  구하러  제게 왔을 때 이 세상에서 가장 꾸밈없는 태도로 제게 이렇게 말했어요. ‘공작부인이 될 운명을 타고나신 분 같아요.’라고요.”\\n\\u3000포킷 씨가 서 있던 자리에는 소파가 하나 놓여 있었다. 그가 죽어가는 검투사처럼 소파 위로 털썩 주저앉았다. 그는 그 와중에도 여전히 공허한 소리로 뭔가를 말하고  있었다.\\n“오늘은 여기까지 하세나, 핍 군.”\\n\\u3000나는 얼른 이 자리를 떠 내 침대로 가는 것이 그를 도와주는 가장 빠른 길이라는 생각이 들었다.\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 24장\\n \\n \\n\\u30002~3일 정도가 지나자 나도 이제 내 방에 적응도 하게 되었고 그 사이에 런던과 런던 인근을 몇 차례 왔다 갔다 하며 필요한 물건들을 상점 주인들에게 주문도 했고, 또 포킷 씨와도 앞으로의 내 교습 방향에 대해 많은 얘기를  나누었다.\\n\\u3000그는 내가 내 자신에 대해 알고 있는 것보다, 내게 예정된 경력에  대해 더 잘 알고 있었다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 나에 대해 이미 재거스(주인공의 후견인) 씨와 대화를 나누었고, 재거스 씨의 말에 의하면 “핍 군의 교육은 어떠한 직업을 목표로 계획할 필요가 없으며, 다만 핍 군이 이런 유복한 환경에 놓인 평균적인 젊은이들과 서로 통해 사이좋게 지낼 수 ‘있으려면’ 그의 운명(어마어마한 부자)에 족할 만큼 충분히 좋은 교육을 받아야 할 것이 네.”라는 것이다.\\n\\u3000물론 나도 동의했다. 그와 반대로 알고 있는 것이 하나도 없었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000포킷 씨(주인공의 신사교육교사)는 내게 런던의 모처 이곳저곳을 다 녀보라고 조언해주었다. 그의 말에 따르면, 그것이 내게 부족한 그런  유의 기초지식들을 얻을 수 있는 좋은 방법이라고 했다.\\n\\u3000그리고 “자네 교육과 관련한 제반사항들에 대해서는 나를 믿어주게. 내가 자네의 설명교사와 지도교사의 역할을 도맡아 주겠네.”라고 말했다. 그는 또한 “자네가 지적인 도움만 잘 받아들인다면 향후 자네가 낙담할 일은 거의 없을 것으로 기대하네. 그러면 곧 내  도움을 제외하 고는 어느 누구의 도움 없이도 잘 해쳐나갈 수 있을 테니까.”\\n\\u3000앞서 말한 비슷한 목적에서 비롯된 많은 대화방식들을 통해, 그는 훌륭한 방식으로 나와 신뢰관계를 쌓아가고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 동시에, 그는 나와 맺은 약속(신사교육)을 이행함에 있어 언제나 대단히 열심이었고 대단히 존경할 만하게 행동했다는 것이다. 또한 그의 그런 고결함이 그의 교육을 따름에 있어 나로 하여금 언제나 열정적이고 명예롭게 행동하게  했다.\\n\\u3000만약 그가 교사로서 이도 저도 아니게 임했더라면, 당연히 나도 제자로서 무성의하게 학습에 임했을 것이다. 하지만 그는 내게 그런 변명의 기회를 주지 않았고, 우린 서로 상대방에게 충직하게 행동했다.\\n\\u3000나는 또한 단 한 번도 그를, 자기 주변에 웃음을 자아내는 요소를  지니고 다니는 인물이라고 여긴 적이 없었으며, 또한 난 단 한 번도  그를, 진지하고 정직하며 선량함과 거리가 먼 어떤 다른 사람으로 여긴 적이 단 한 차례도 없었다.\\n이것이 그가 나와 소통한 개인지도 교습방식이었다. \\n\\u3000이러한 사항들이 하나 둘 씩 자리를 잡아가고, 내가 열정적으로 그 과제를 수행할  수 있을 만큼 훨씬 일이 실행되고 났을 때, 나는 문득  이런  생각이 났다.\\n\\u3000‘만약 바너드 여관(포킷 씨의 아들이 머무는 곳)에 있는 내 침실을 그대로 둔다면, 내 삶에 기분 좋은 다양한 요소들이 그대로 유지되는 것이며, 또한 허버트(주인공의 친구)와 계속 같이 지낸다 해도 내 시골 풍의 매너들이 더 나빠지려야 나빠질 리도 없다.’라는 생각.\\n\\u3000포킷 씨(허버트의 아버지. 허버트는 주인공의 친구. 허버트는 주인공 중의 한 명)도 이런 내 의견에 반대하지 않았다. 다만 내 생각을 이행하기 전에, 내 후견인(재거스 변호사)의 의견을 먼저 물어봐야한다는 것이다.\\n\\u3000나는 이것이, 내 계획이 허버트의 주거비용을 다소 경감해준다는 고찰에서 나온 여림(섬세함)임을  느꼈다.\\n\\u3000그래서 자리를 떠 ‘리틀 브리튼(런던 북서쪽에 있는 거리이름)’으로 가서 재거스 씨(변호사, 주인공의 후견인)에게 내 의사를 알려야했다.\\n\\u3000“저를 위해 지금 세놓고 계신 가구들과 하나 혹은 둘 정도의 사소한 물품들을 제가 구입 할 수 있다면, 저는 그곳에서 아주 편안해질 겁니다.”\\n\\u3000“이해했네!” 재거스 씨(주인공의 후견인, 변호사)가 잠시 웃더니 말했다. “내가 일찍이 말하지 않았나, 자네들이 함께 잘 지낼 거라고. 그래!  얼마를 원하는가?”\\n나는 대충 얼마의 비용이 소요될지는 잘 모르겠다고 말했다.\\n\\u3000“어서!” 재거스 씨가 그런 내 태도에 쏘아붙이며 말했다. “그래서 얼마? 2천5백만원 정도면  되겠나?”\\n“아, 그렇게 많이는 필요 없을 것 같습니다.” \\n“그럼 2백만원?” 재거스 씨가  말했다.\\n\\u3000그런 엄청난 금액 하락에 몹시 당황한 내가 말했다. “제 말은 그러니까 그보단 더 많이요.”\\n\\u3000“그보단 많아야한다, 그건가?” 재거스 씨가 느긋하게 내 대답을 기다리며 대꾸했다. 물론 그 특유의 자세를 잃지 않고 있었는데, 상대방의 대답을 기다리며 두 손을 호주머니에 넣고 고개를 한 쪽으로 기울이고 두 눈은 내 뒤에 있는 벽을 쳐다보면서 그는 말하고 있었다. “그러니까 얼마?”\\n“정확히 정의하기가 어렵습니다.” 머뭇거리며 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“자 어서 말해보게!” 재거스  씨가  말했다.  “계산해보세.  다섯  장의 두 배(1천만원)는 어떤가? 아님 다섯 장의 세 배(1천5백만원)? 그거면 되겠나? 그도 아니면 다섯 장의 네 배는(2천만원)? 그러면 되겠나?”\\n\\u3000나는 그 정도 금액이면  이사비용으로  관대하리라  생각한다고  말했다.\\n\\u3000“좋아 ‘다섯 장의 네 배(2000만원)’면 넉넉할 거다, 이 말이지?” 재거스 씨가 눈살을 찌푸리며 말했다. “그럼, 자네는 5의 4배가 무엇이라고 생각하는가?”\\n“뭐냐 이요?”\\n“허!” 재거스 씨가 말했다. “그러니까 얼마냐고?”\\n“제 생각에는  일천만원이라고  생각됩니다만.”  내가  웃으며  말했다. “이 친구야, 내가 말한 금액 따위엔 신경 쓰지 좀 말게.” 재거스 씨\\n가 짜증스러워 더 이상은 못 참겠다는 듯이 고개를 발딱 쳐들며 말했     다. “자네가 얼마를 필요로  하느냐고?”\\n“물론,  일천만원이 필요합니다.”\\n\\u3000“웨믹(서기)!” 재거스 씨가 사무실 문을 열며 말했다. “핍 씨에게서 지불영수증을 받아두게. 그리고 지금 일천만원을 내드리고.”\\n\\u3000이 강력한 인상을 남기는 그의 일하는 방식은 내게 강력한 인상을 남겼다. 물론 기분 좋은 종류의 인상은 아니었다.\\n\\u3000재거스(주인공의 후견인, 변호사) 씨는 결코 웃는 적이 없었다.  하지만 그는 삑삑 소리가 나는 밝은 색의 큰 부츠를 신고 있었고, 그 부츠 위에서 자신의 평정을 유지하고 있었다. 그의 큰 고개를 아래로 구부리고서 두 눈썹에 힘을 줘 모으고서 상대방의 대답을 기다리며 그는 이 밝은 색의 큰 구두 위에서 몸의 평형을 유지하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그는 상대의 대답을 기다리며 이따금씩 구두로 삑삑 소리를 냈는데, 이건 마치 그의 구두가 메마르고 의심스러운 방식으로 상대방을 비웃고 있는 것  같았다.\\n\\u3000이제 우연히도 그가 외출하고 없었고, 웨믹(서기)은 활기차고 이야기 하길 좋아하는 스타일이었기 때문에, 나는 웨믹에게 “제가 재거스 씨의 태도를 어떻게 이해해야할 지를 전혀 모르겠는데요.”라고 말했다.\\n\\u3000 “그에게 그 얘기를 하세요. 그럼 그는 그것을 칭찬으로 받아들일 겁 니다.” 웨믹(서기)이 말했다. “당신이 그의 태도를 이해하는 것은 그가 진정 바라는 것이 아닙니다. 오~*_*(놀람)” 그의 말이  갑자기  끊긴 것은 내가 깜짝 놀란 표정을 지었기 때문이다. “그건 개인적인 감정이 개입된 것이 아니랍니다. 단지 직업, 단지 직업적인 태도일 뿐이에요.” 웨믹은 자신의 책상에서 점심을 먹고 있었다. 건조하고 딱딱한 비스 킷을 오도독 오도독 씹고 있었다. 그는 그 비스킷 조각들을 이따금씩 자신의 가늘고 긴 상처 같은 입 안으로 던져 넣고 있었는데 마치 우체\\n통에 편지 집어넣듯이  말이다.\\n\\u3000“저에게도 항상 그러는 걸요.” 웨믹이 말했다. “그는 사람 잡는 함정을 설치해놓곤 관찰을 하죠. 그러다 갑자기 철컥 하는 소리가 들리면 어느새 당신은 걸려든  거랍니다.”\\n\\u3000사람 잡는 함정이 사람을 기분 좋게 응대하는 건 아니지 않느냐고 비평하지 않고, 난 그냥 “제 생각엔, 그가 아주 기술이 좋은 것 같네 요?”라고만 말했다.\\n\\u3000“깊이를 알 수가 없죠.” 웨믹(서기)이 말했다. “마치 오스트레일리아 대륙 같다니까요.” 그가 펜으로 사무실 바닥을 가리키며 말했다. 그의 행동으로 봐선, 런던 정반대지점에 있는 것이 지정학적으로 오스트레 일리아 대륙 아니냐는 표시인 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000“만약 더 깊은 곳이 있다면.” 웨믹이 펜을 다시 종이 위에 놓으며 덧붙였다. “그건 바로 그(재거스)일  겁니다.”\\n\\u3000그때, 내가 “그가 훌륭한 직업을 가지고 있는 것 같습니다”라고 말하자, 웨믹이 대답했다.  “최에~고고~죠오(최고죠)!”\\n\\u3000그때, 내가 “여기 직원은 총 몇 분이나 되십니까?”라고 물었고, 그가 대답하기를.\\n\\u3000“직원이 많지는 않습니다. 재거스 씨(주인공의 후견인, 런던 유명 변호사) 혼자만 있으면 되니까요. 의뢰인들도 모두 그와 직접 대면하길 원하죠. 여기 직원은 총 4명뿐입니다. 그들을 보여드릴까요? 어차피 당신도 우리 식구니까, 제가 그렇게 말씀드려도 되겠죠?”\\n\\u3000나는 그 제안(사무실구경)을 받아들였다. 그러자 웨믹(서기)은 먹고 있던 비스킷들을 우체통(입) 안에 몽땅 털어 넣더니, 금고 안에 있던 돈궤(궤=네모난 나무그릇)에서 나에게 일천만원을 내어준 후, 금고 열 쇠를 의자등받이 아래 어딘가에 살짝 감춰둔 후, ‘나선형 나사 후크(나사식 고리 멈춤쇠)’ 꺼내듯이 자신의 코트 상의 칼라를 위로 길게 내뻗친 후(-_- 뭔 소린지... 쉽게 옮기려다 앞뒤가 안 맞는 엉뚱한 말이 되 어버림-_ㅜ 일단 패스~), 계단을 밟고 올라가기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000변호사 사무실은 생각보다 어둡고  허름했다.  계단에도  재거스(변호 사) 씨 집무실처럼 기름때가 껴있었다. 사무실 벽의 어깨높이에 기름때를 남긴 의뢰인들은 마찬가지로 발을 질질 끌며 수년간 계단을 위아래로 밟고 다녔고 그래서 생긴 기름때 같았다.\\n\\u30001층 앞방으로 들어가자, ‘선술집의 주인’과 ‘쥐 잡는 사람’ 중간 어딘가에 해당되는 것같이 보이는 사무원이 한 명 보였다. 그는 엄청 창백하고 임신한 것처럼 몸이 부풀고 물에 퉁퉁 부은 것 같은 몸을 지닌 사나이였다. 그는 초라한 모습을 한 세 명 혹은 네 명  남직한 사람들과 한 바탕 전투를 벌이고 있었다. 그 사무원은 사람들을 예의고 뭐고  할 것 없이 인정사정없이 대하고 있었는데 아마 재거스 씨(런던유명변 호사)의 금고에 돈을 갖다 바치는 이 선량한 의뢰인들은 죄다 그딴 식 으로 험하게 다루어지는  모양이었다.\\n\\u3000“저래 봬도 모여서 증거를 확보하고 있는 중이랍니다.” 우리가 방에서 나오자 웨믹이 설명해주었다. “런던여성교도소(이름이 ‘더 베일러’. 소설의 중요한 복선입니다. 그러니까 ‘여성교도소’가 복선입니다. 재거스 변호사가 여성교도소와 연관이 있다는 것이 중요. 기억해두시면 소설흐름 이해에 좋음. ‘여성’이란 단어 꼭 기억~)에서 곧 재판이 있을 예정이거든요.”\\n\\u3000그 방 건너 방으로 들어가자, 군살(뚱댕이)이 약간 축 늘어진 것 같은 ‘테리어개’(털북숭이 애완견)같이 생긴 사무원 한 사람이 정말이지 자신의 머리카락을 북슬북슬  흔들어대고  있었다.  자신이  강아지였을  때 깜빡 잊고 불필요한 털을 자르지 못한 테리어개 같았다.\\n웨믹이 설명해주었다.\\n\\u3000“저 사람은 제련업자입니다. 자신의 항아리를 항상 달구고 있죠. 당신만 응한다면 지금 당장이라도 당신을 녹여 뭔가를 만들 수 있는 사람이죠.”\\n\\u3000하지만 내가 보기에 그는 지금 과도하게 땀을 흘리며 펄펄 끓고 있었다. 마치 자신의 제련기술을 자기 자신에게 먼저 시도해보겠다는 심산인  것 같았다.\\n\\u3000뒷방으로 가니, 어깨가 높은 한 남성이 더러운 ‘플란넬’(‘면’과 ‘양의 털’을 썩어 만든 가벼운 천)로 안면 신경통에 걸린 얼굴을 감싸고 있었다. 그는 낡은 검은 색 옷을 입고 있었는데, 꼭 밀랍(벌이 집지을 때 사용하는 밀랍)을 먹인 옷을 착용한 것 같은 겉모습을 하고 있었다. 그는 몸을 앞으로 기울인 채 ‘앞서 말한 두 신사’(사무원)가 작성한 문서의 글씨를 또박또박 다시 바르게 적고 있었다. 아마 재거스 씨 본인이 쓸 문서들인 것  같았다.\\n이것이 건물 내부 전경 모두였다(직원 4명).\\n\\u3000우리(웨믹과 주인공)가 다시 아래층으로 내려왔을 때, 웨믹이 나를 이끌고 내 후견인(재거스 씨, 주인공의 법률담당 후견인)의 집무실로 갔다,\\n웨믹이 말했다. “벌써 보셨겠지요.”\\n\\u3000“근데요.” 이런 젠장, 흉측하게 생긴 그 두 개의 주물(쇳물을 녹여 만든 사람얼굴모양의 주물)에 그만 또 눈이 가고 말았다. 그 흉측함에 초조해진 내가 주물들을 곁눈질하며  말했다.\\n“누구의 두상(얼굴)입니까?”\\n\\u3000“이것들 요?” 웨믹(변호사 사무실 서기, 45세)이 의자에서 일어서며 그 비참하고 무섭고 불쾌하게 생긴 두상들 위에 쌓인 먼지들을 “휴” 불어 날려버린 뒤 책상 위에 내려놓았다.\\n\\u3000“이것들은 유명한 인물들을 본 떠 만든 거랍니다. 우리에게 어마어마한 성공을 가져다준 고객들이었죠.

(*_*  오마이갓)\\n\\u3000“닮았느냐고요? 웬걸요 똑 같은걸요. 이게 그죠. 아시잖아요. 이 주물은 뉴게이트 감옥(런던의 옛날감옥, 1902에 폐쇄됨)까지 가서 직접 떠온 데스마스크랍니다. 교수형이 집행되자 마자 그 즉시 데스마스크를 떴는걸요. (데스마스크를 보며) 응, 네 놈은 나를 각별히도 좋아했지, 안 그래? 이 교활한 늙은 작자야!”라고 웨믹이 말했다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 그는, 위에 항아리가 놓인 무덤 앞에 ‘수양버들과 여인의 모습’이 그려진 장식 핀을 매만지며, 자신이 왜 이 두상에 각별한 애정을 가지게 되었는지  설명했다.\\n“이걸 그가 만들어주었지요,  각별히!”\\n\\u3000“(웨믹의 장식  핀에  있는  여인을 가리키며) 이 숙녀는  누구죠?” 내가 물었다.\\n\\u3000“오!” 웨믹이 즉시 반응했다. “웬걸요. 그가 장난친 겁니다.

(다시 주인공을 바라보며) 절대 아닙니다, 핍 씨. 이 여자는 귀부인과는 전혀 상관없는 여자 입니다. ‘ㅅ’자도 생각하지 마세오. 호리호리하고 가냘픈 숙녀일 랑은 거리가 먼 여자였습니다. 그리고 홍차주전자에 주의를 기울일만한 여 자도 절대 아니었죠. 홍차주전자 안에 술이 들어있다면야 또 모를까.”\\n\\u3000자신의 장식 핀(브로치)에 생각이 닿자, 그는 들고 있던 두상을 내려 놓은 후, 호주머니에서 손수건을 꺼내 장식 핀을 열심히 닦아주는 센스를 보였다.\\n\\u3000“(주인공이 다른 두상을 가리키며) 저 다른 사람이 동일한 최후를 맞이했나요?” 내가 물었다. “그가 똑같은 표정을 짓고 있어서요.”\\n\\u3000“맞습니다.” 웨믹(서기, 45세)이 말했다. “리얼한 표정이죠. 잘 보십시오. 그의 콧방울 한쪽이 ‘작은 낚시 바늘’에 꿰여 ‘말 털 하나’로 들어 올려 져 있는 것 같지 않습니까. 예, 그렇습니다. 이 자도 같은 종말을 맞이했었죠. 제가 말씀드릴 수 있는 건 그게 여기선 아주 당연한 귀결이라는 거죠. 그는 유언장을 위조했습니다. 빈틈없이 위조했죠. 소위(이른바) 유언자들을 안락사 시키지만 않았다면 말이죠. (두상을 쳐다보며) 그렇지만 정말 신사다운 녀석이기도 했었죠.”\\n\\u3000웨믹은 관심을 강하게 불러일으키는 수사법(말하기)을 사용하며 말하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“(계속 두상을 쳐다보며) 그리스어를 쓸 수 있다고 말했겠다. 예라, 이 뺀질이 같은 사람아! 이 뻔뻔한 거짓말쟁이! 세상천지에 당신 같은 거짓말쟁이도 없을 거다, 예라 이 나쁜 사람아!”\\n\\u3000웨믹은 고인이 된  자신의 친구(두상)를 다시 선반 위에 올려놓기 전에, 망자의 유품으로서 끼고 있는 반지들 중에서 가장 큰 반지를 매만지며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그가 사람을 보내 이 반지를 사다주었답니다. 사형집행 바로 전날 말이죠.”\\n\\u3000그가 다른 석고상을 올려놓고 의자로 돌아오는  동안,  나는  웨믹의 옷에 달린 모든 장신구들이 모두 그와 같은 출처(미망인의 유품)에서 비롯된 것은 아닌지 심각하게 고민하기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000그의 행동에서 그 주제(미망인의 유품)에 대한 어떤 망설임도 보이지 않았기 때문에, 나는 그에게 모험하듯 조심스럽게 궁금한 것을 물어보았다. 그건 그가 내 앞에 서서 자신의 두 손에 묻은 먼지를 닦아낼 때였다.\\n\\u3000“오 그거요.” 그의 대답이 돌아왔다. “예 맞습니다. 이것들(웨믹의 장신구들)은 모두 그런 종류의 선물들입니다. 하나가 모이니까 또 하나가 모이더군요. 늘 그런 식이었죠. 전 항상 얻어왔고 그리고 진기하기도 하고요. 혹 모르죠. 나중에라도 재산이 될지. 하지만 지금 봐선 그렇게 값나갈 것 같진 않지만요. 어쨌든 값도 나가 보이고 휴대할 수도 있으니 착용하고 다니게 되었습니다. 물론 앞으로 발전할 가능성이 많은 당신 같은 젊은이(25세)들이 보기엔 사소해보일 수 있겠지만 제(45 세)겐 아니거든요. ‘휴대할 수 있는 재산은 일단 거머쥐고 보라’가 제 ‘길잡이 별’이랍니다.”\\n\\u3000“아, 그렇군요.” 내가 그의 생활신조에 존경을 표시하자, 그가 예의 그 친근한 태도로 다시 얘기를 계속했다.\\n\\u3000“혹시라도 더 나은 일을 하실 수  없는 그런  이상한  때에,  실례가 되 지 않는다면 저희 집을 한 번 방문해주시겠습니까. 월워스(런던 도심지역. 런던 한 가운데에 있음)에 위치해있습니다. 당신께 저희 집 침대를 제공할 수 있다면, 저는 그것을 영광으로 생각하겠습니다. 보여드릴 것이 별로 없지만, 당신이 잠깐 짬을 내서라도 구경해주셨으면 하는 2~3가지 골동품이 있거든요. 그리고 제가 가꾸는 ‘아주 작은 뜰 하나’ 와 ‘정자(정원의 정자)’도  있고요.”\\n\\u3000나는 그런 후한 대접을 받게 된 것이 너무너무 기쁘다고 말씀드렸다.\\n\\u3000“과찬이십니다.” 그가 말했다. “그럼 당신께서 편리한 때에 그 일이 이루어지라 생각해두겠습니다. 아직 재거스 씨(변호사)가 정찬(코스요리)을 대접한 적은  없으시죠?”\\n“예, 아직요.”\\n\\u3000“글쎄요.” 웨믹(서기)이 말했다. “재거스 씨가 조만간 와인을 대접하실 겁니다. 꽤 괜찮은 와인이죠. 저는 당신께 펀치(펀치=술+설탕+우유\\n+레몬+향료, 네이버검색참조)를 제공하겠습니다. 썩 나쁘진 않은 펀치죠. 그건 그렇고 중요한 얘길 하나 해드릴까요. 재거스 씨 집에 초대받아 가실 때, 그의 가사도우미를 유심히 살펴봐주십시오.”\\n“가희 희한한 뭔가 라도 보게 될 거란 말씀이신가요?”\\n\\u3000“글쎄요.” 웨믹이 말했다. “야수가 길들여진 모습을 보시게 될 겁니다. 흔치 않은  경우는  아니지  않느냐고 말씀하시려든  참이시죠. 그럼  제 대답은 이렇습니다. 그것은 야수가 본래 지니고 있던 야생성에 달린 문제이며 그 길들여짐의 총량에 달린 문제라고요. 재거스 씨의 권력을 결코 당신은 무시하지 못하시게 될  겁니다.  꼭  눈여겨봐주십시 오.”\\n\\u3000그가 각오를 일깨워주다 보니, 나도 호기심과 흥미로움을 잔뜩 느끼    고 꼭 그러겠다고  말했다.\\n대화를 나누다보니 어느덧 출발지(웨믹의 책상)로 와있었다. 그가  내게 물었다.\\n\\u3000“아 참, 5분이면 되는데. 어떻게 재거스 씨가 열심히 일하고 있는 모습을 보실 의향은  없으신지요?”\\n\\u3000몇 가지 이유들로 인해 그리고 재거스 씨(런던 유명 변호사)가 무슨 일을 하는 지 정도는 알아둬도 나쁠 것 같지 않아서, 나는 재거스 씨를 보러가는 것에  찬성했다.\\n\\u3000우리는 시티오브런던(행정구역이름. 런던 심장부임. 시티오브런던 아 래쪽으로 템스 강이 흐름)으로  향했다.\\n\\u3000우리는 사람들로 분비는 즉결 심판소(경범죄자 다루는 심판소) 안으로 들어갔다.\\n\\u3000그곳에는 기발한 취미로 웨믹의 장식 핀을 만들어 주었던 두상(데스 마스크)의 주인과 마치 혈족 관계인 것 같이 살기등등하게 생긴 자가  법정 난간에 서 있었다. 그는 기분이 언짢은지 뭔가를 “쩍쩍” 씹으며 으깨고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내 후견인(재거스 변호사)은 어떤 여성에게 심문 혹은 반대 신문을  하고 있었다. 어느 쪽의 신문인지 알 수가 없었다. 하지만 그의 심문은 그녀에게 현저한 타격을 끼쳤고, 법관은 물론 법정에 있던 모든 이들로 하여금 두려운 마음을 불러일으키고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그게 무엇이든지 간에,  만약  누군가가  재거스  씨가  인정하지  않는 한 마디라도 하려고 하면, 재거스 씨는 즉시 그것을 “기록해둘 것”을 서기에게 요구했다.\\n\\u3000또한 누군가가 시인을 하지 않으려 하면, 재거스 씨는 “내 반드시 당신에게서 시인을 받고 말겠소!”라고  말했다.\\n\\u3000그리고 누군가가 만약 시인을 하면, 재거스 씨는 “당신이 시인했다는 사실을 기억해두시오!”라고  말했다.\\n\\u3000재거스 씨가 자신의 집게손가락 옆을 깨물 때마다 치안판사들은 와 들와들 떨었다.\\n\\u3000재거스  씨가 세치 혀를 놀릴 때마다 ‘도둑들’과 ‘도둑  잡는 순경들’ 은 공포와 불안에 떨며 버티고 서서 재거스 씨의 눈썹 한 가닥이라도 자신들 쪽으로 향할 것 같으면 놀람과 충격으로 움츠러들었다.\\n\\u3000재거스 씨가 여자 쪽 편인지 남자 쪽 편인지 나는 분간할 수 없었다. 내가 봤을 때 재거스 씨는 법정을 통째로 제분기에 넣고 가루로  만들고 있는 듯 보였기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000내가 그 자리를 몰래 빠져 나올 때, 다만 재거스 씨가 치안판사들 편은 아님을 알 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면, 그 날 법정에서 ‘영국의 법과 정의’의 대표로 자신의 직무를 수행하고 있던 늙은 신사를 공공연하게 비난함으로써, 법정의 사회를 주재하고 있던 늙은 신사가 겁을 집어 먹고 책상 아래에서 그의 두 다리가 발작적인 경련을 일으키게 하고 있었기 때문이다(판사가 겁을 먹었다. 판사의 두 다리에 경련이 났다-_-;

정말 단어 선택하곤, 내가 했지만  쯧쯧  ._.) \\n\\u3000 “바로 그겁니다!” 웨믹(변호사사무실 서기 및 출납담당직원)이 대답했다.\\n\\u3000“그도 공공연히 하는 말이니까요. ‘감히 내 집을 도둑질해, 흥 어느 놈이 그럴 수 있는지 보고야 말겠다.’라고요.  주님의  가호가  있기를. 제가 그에게서 들은 것만 쳐도, 한 수백 번은 더 될 겁니다. 항상 우리 사무실 앞에서 그가 상습도둑들에게 말하죠. ‘내 집이 어딘지 알겠지,    자, 난 한 번도 빗장을 건 적이 없어. 어때? 내 집도 한번 털어보시지? 자 어서, 왜 못하겠어서?’ 그런데 말입니다, 핍 씨, 재거스 씨가 아무리 부추겨도 그놈들 중 아무도 그걸  시도하진  않더군요.  아무리 해도 말이죠. 그 정도로까진 대담하지 않았던 거죠. 도둑들이 말입니다.”\\n“도둑들이 그렇게 그를 두려워합니까?” 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그를 두려워하냐고요?” 웨믹이 말했다. “물론 두려워하죠.  재거스 씨가 꾀를 부리는 것도 압니다. 비록 그가 도둑들을 향해 도발을 하지만, 실은 그의 집에 은쟁반은 하나도 없거든요. 핍 씨, 아시겠지요? 수저도 죄다 ‘브리타니아 합금(백랍 수저=흰색 합금=주석+구리. 저렴함)’ 뿐이랍니다.”\\n\\u3000“그러니까 도둑들이 얻을 게 많지 않겠군요.” 내(25세 남주인공)가 논평했다. “물론 그들이 훔칠 수만 있다면….”\\n\\u3000“아~! 그렇죠, 하지만 재거스 씨가 얻을 건 많죠.” 웨믹(변호사사무실 서기, 45세)이 내 말을 살짝 자르며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“도둑들도 아는 거죠. 재거스 씨가 자신들의 목숨을 쥐고 있다는 걸, 수십 명의 목숨을 말입니다. 도둑이 들면 재거스 씨는 가질 수 있던 것을 모두 가질 것이고, 재거스 씨가 의향만 있다면 이번엔 그가 가질 수 없는 것이 무엇인지조차 알 수 없게 되죠.”\\n\\u3000웨믹이 다시 말을 꺼냈을 때, 난 내 후견인의 위대함에 대해 명상에  빠져 있었다.\\n웨믹이  다시 말했다.\\n\\u3000“접시가 왜 없나 면, 그건 그의 내면의 깊이 때문입니다. 아시겠죠.  강이 타고난 깊이를 가지듯, 재거스 씨도 자신만의 내면의 깊이를 지니고 있습니다. 그의 시계 줄 보셨나요? 그건 진짜랍니다.”\\n“아주 크고 무거워 보이던데요.” 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“크고 무겁다?” 웨믹이 대꾸했다. “동의합니다. 순금으로 만든 반복 타종 시계죠. 돈으로 따지면 아마 5천만 원은 족히 될 겁니다. 핍 씨 (주인공이름, 25세), 런던 시내에서 이 순금시계에 대해 알고 있는 도 둑들이 대략 7백 명은 된답니다. 그 자들은 재거스 씨의 순금시계 쇠 사슬에 달린 가장 작은 고리 하나도 식별해내지 못할 남자, 여자, 아이가 아닙니다. 그들이 만약 재거스 씨의 유혹에 넘어가 그 시계에 손을 댄다면, 그 순간 시계가 시뻘겋게 달라 올라 도둑들이 시계를 떨어뜨리고  마는 거죠.”\\n\\u3000처음에는 그런 담소(재거스 씨)를 나누면서, 나중에는 보다 일상적인 얘기들을 나누면서, 웨믹 씨와 난 시간도 잊은 채 거리도 잊은 채 걸었다.\\n\\u3000웨믹 씨가 “월워스(런던 도심지역. 런던 한 복판임, 웨믹의 집)에 거진(거의) 다 도착했군요.”라고 말해줄 때까지 말이다.\\n\\u3000(재거스 씨의 사무실과 집 그리고 웨믹 씨의 집 모두 가까운 거리에 있음. 런던 시내 한 복판임, 주인공이 하숙을 하고 있는 포킷 씨의 집도  당시  기준으로  런던  인근이지  지금은  모두  런던시내임. 아닌가?~\\n._.)\\n\\u3000월워스(웨믹의 집과 그 주변풍경)는 어둡고 좁은  길들과  도랑들과 작은 정원들로 이루어진 곳이었다. 상당히 재미없고 한적한 인상을 주    고 있었다.\\n\\u3000웨믹의 집은 목재로 만든 작은 오두막이었다. 정원으로 구획된 작은   터 한 가운데에 집이 있었다.  지붕  꼭대기는 마치 대포들을  장착한  포병 중대처럼 나무를 잘라 모양새를 내고 색이 칠해져 있었다.\\n\\u3000“제가 직접 지은 집이랍니다.” 웨믹이 말했다. “쓸 만해 보이시지 않 나요?”\\n\\u3000난 아낌없는 칭찬을 해주었다. 내가 지금까지 보아온 가장 작은 집일 거라는 생각이 들었다. 괴상한 고딕양식의 창문들(중세시대 교회건 물의 창, 창살이 있는 창문)과 안으로 들어가기엔 턱없이 작은 고딕양식의 정문을 가진 집이었다. 단연컨대 창문들 중 많은 부분이 가짜창 문이었다.\\n\\u3000“저건 진짜 깃대랍니다, 보이시죠.” 웨믹이 말했다. “일요일이면 전 진짜 깃발 하나를 높이 매달아 놓지요. 자 여기를 보십시오. 제가 이 다리를 건너간 후, 이렇게 다리를 올려놓고 전 외부와의 통신을 차단 해버리죠.”\\n\\u3000그가 말한 다리는 두꺼운 판자 한 짝이었다. 그것은 폭이 대략 1.2미터 깊이가 대략 0.6미터쯤 되어 보이는, 땅 속 ‘틈’을 가로지르며 놓여 있었다. 하지만 그가 판자를 빠르게 감아올리는 것이며 그 일을 하는 동안 웃고 있는 그의 모습을 지켜보는 것은 유쾌한 일이었다. 그의 긍지가 느껴졌다. 또한 그가 짓는 웃음은 단순한 기계적 웃음이 아니 었다. 정말로 흥미로운 일을 하는 자의 웃음이었다.\\n\\u3000“그리니치 시간(세계의 기준시간)으로 매일 밤 9시면요.” 웨믹이 말했다. “대포를 발사하죠. 저기 보이시죠. 저기 말입니다. 당신도 한 번 들어보세요, 제대로 한 방 맞았다고 생각하실 걸요.”\\n\\u3000그가 말한 대포는 격자 모양을 한 별도의 요새 안에 장착되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000정교하게 만든 작은 선원용 외투가 우산과 비슷한 기능을 하며 비바 람으로부터 대포를 보호하고  있었다.\\n\\u3000 “게다가 뒤에, 눈에 띄지 않는 곳에 돼지우리가 있습니다.” 웨믹이 말했다. “집의 요새화란 개념을 방해하지 않기 위해서 후방에 두었죠. 마음먹은 걸 행동으로 옮기고 버텨라 제 인생철학이거든요. 당신도 동의하실지 모르겠지만요.”\\n“물론 저도 동의해요.” 내가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“집 뒤에서 돼지 한 마리와 닭들 그리고 토끼들을 기르고 있습니다. 제 손으로 조그만 프레임(뼈대)들을 이어서 이렇게 오이들을 좀 키우고 있습니다. 제가 어떤 종류의 샐러드용 생야채를 가꿀 수 있는지는  이번 저녁 식사 때 아시게 될 겁니다. 자, 핍 씨.”\\n\\u3000웨믹이 웃으면서 하지만 굉장히 진지한 표정으로 고개를 흔들며 말을 이었다.\\n\\u3000“이 조그만 곳이 포위공격을 받는다고 상상해보십시오. 만약 음식 제공의 측면에서라면 이곳은 적이 아주 골치 아플 정도로까지 오랫동안  버텨낼 겁니다.”\\n\\u3000그러더니 나를 이끌고 10미터 정도 떨어진 나무그늘로 안내했다. 하지만 가는 길이 너무도 정교하게 꼬여 있어서 그곳까지 가는데 꽤 오랜  시간이 걸렸다.\\n\\u3000이 은거 처(은신처)에는 우리를 위한 잔이 놓여 있었다. 장식용(인 공)호수에 우리를 위한 펀치(펀치=술+설탕+우유+레몬+향료, 네이버검 색참조)도 하나 차갑게 유지되고 있었다. 장식용 호수 가장자리 위에  나무  그늘이  세워져 있었다.\\n\\u3000이곳의 물은 원형을 그리며 순환하고 있었다. 그 한가운데에는 섬이 하나 있었고, 크기가 저녁 식사 자리에 올릴 샐러드용 생야채 크기쯤 되어 보였다.\\n\\u3000섬 안에는 분수도 하나 만들어져 있었다. 그가 만든 분수 같았다. 우리가 자그마한 방앗간을 작동 시키고 파이프에서 코르크 마개 하나를 쏙 빼면, 그 분수가 힘차게 확장해 내 손을 아주 많이 적시고 다시 줄어들  정도는 되었다.\\n\\u3000“엔지니어(기계공)도 되면서 목수도 되면서 배관공도 되면서 정원사도 되면서 그렇게 만들었죠. 만물박사처럼 요.” 내가 칭찬하는 말을 받아들이며  웨믹이 말했다.\\n\\u3000“만족한답니다. 이 정도면 괜찮은 편이죠. ‘뉴게이트 감옥(런던의 유명한 옛날감옥)’의 흔적도 지울 수 있고, 연로하신 부모님도 기쁘게 해드릴 수 있으니까요. 어떻습니까, 이제부터 제 아버지를 소개해드리고 싶은데요. 제가 부담을 드리는 것은 아닌지?”\\n“아뇨 저도 만나 뵙고 싶었어요.”라고 말씀드렸다. 우리는 성곽 안(집안)으로  들어갔다.\\n\\u3000플란넬 외투(표면에 솜털이 있는 외투. 모직물의 일종)를 입은 아주 연로한 노인 한 분이 난로가 옆에 앉아 계셨다.  깨끗한  모습이셨고  약 간 유쾌하게 약간은 편안하게 그렇게 잘 보살펴지고 있는 분이란 인상을 받았다. 하지만 귀가 몹시 안 들리시는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000“꽤 나이 드신 분이시죠.” 웨믹이 말했다. 그런 후 웨믹은 아버지와 진심어린 악수를 나누며 익살맞은 어조로 말했다.\\n“어떠셨어요?”\\n“오 그래, 존(웨믹의 애칭). 모두 괜찮다!” 노인이 대답했다.\\n\\u3000“(큰 소리로) 이 분이 핍 씨세요, 아버님.” 웨믹이 말했다. “(큰 소리로) 핍 씨 이름을 들을 수 있다면 좋겠어요. (작은 목소리로) 핍 씨, 아버님께 고개를 끄떡여드리세요. 아주 좋아하신답니다. 실례가 안 된 다면 윙크(눈짓) 하듯이 고개를 많이 끄떡여드리세요!”\\n\\u3000“(주인공을 향해 큰 목소리로) 이곳은 제 아들놈이 지은 훌륭한 집이랍니다, 선생님.” 내가 가능한 한 열심히 고개를 끄떡여드리는 동안 노인이 외쳤다.\\n\\u3000“(주인공을 향해 큰 목소리로) 아주 아담한 유원지랍니다, 선생. 이 장소와 이 아름다운 물품들은 제 아들놈이 죽은 후에도 사람들의 즐거움을 위해 국가에 의해 유지돼야 해요.”\\n\\u3000“(주인공에게) 이곳이 아주 자랑스러우신 겁니다. (아버지에게) 그렇죠? 아버지.”\\n노인의  얼굴을  바라보는  그의  딱딱한  얼굴이  이내  부드러워졌다. “(큰 소리로) 고개를 끄떡여드릴게요.”라며 웨믹이 엄청나게 큰 동작\\n으로 고개를 한 번 끄떡여드렸다.\\n\\u3000“(큰 소리로) 한  번 더요.” 좀 전보다 더 큰 동작을 취하며 그가 고개를 끄떡여드렸다.\\n\\u3000“(주인공에게) 아 괜찮으시다면, 당신도 저와 같이 해주실 수 있나요, 핍 씨? 첫 방문에 너무 피곤하게 해드리는 건 아닌지, 가볍게 한번 더 고개를 끄떡여주실래요? 그게 아버지를 얼마나 기쁘게 하는지 당신은 상상도 못하실  겁니다.”\\n\\u3000나는 몇 차례 더 고개를 살짝 끄떡여드렸다. 아버님은 기분이 아주 좋아보였다.\\n\\u3000닭들에게 먹이를 주려는 아버지의 기분을 북돋아준 후, 우리는 나무 그늘의 휴식 장소로 가 자리를 잡고 펀치(=설탕 술+우유+레몬)를 마셨다.\\n어느  정도  마신  후  웨믹이  담배  한  개비를  피우며  내게  말했다. “한두 푼씩 모아 지금과 같은 완전한 모습으로 만드는데 꽤 여러 해\\n가 걸렸습니다.”\\n“당신 집(소유)인가요, 웨믹  씨?”\\n\\u3000“오, 그럼요.” 웨믹이 말했다. “시간을 조금씩 나눠가며 땅을 알아봤죠. 이 토지는 정확히 조지(웨믹)의 땅입니다. 암요!”\\n“정말요? 재거스 씨도  반하겠는데요.”\\n\\u3000“그는 아직 이 집을 모릅니다.” 웨믹이 말했다. “들어본 적도 없는걸요. 그는 제 아버님을 뵌 적도 없고, 제 아버님에 들은 적도 없습니다. 전혀요. 사무실은 사무이고, 사적인 공간은 사적인 공간이죠. 전 사무실로 출근할 때는, 이 성(집)을 뒤에 남겨두고 간답니다. 그리고 제가  다시 성(집)으로 돌아와야 할 때는 사무실을 제 뒤로 남겨두고 오죠. 불쾌한 부탁이 아니시라면, 전 당신께서도 이 집을 그렇게 대해주셨으면 합니다. 사무실에 소문이 나는 걸 원치 않거든요.”\\n나는 당연히 그의 요구를 엄수해야겠다는 선의의 감정을 느꼈다. 펀치(=설탕 술+우유+레몬)의  맛이  아주 좋았기  때문에, 우리는 나무\\n그늘에서 얘기하며 마시며 하다 보니 어느덧 밤 9시가 다 되어 있었다.\\n그때 웨믹이 자신의 파이프(담배)를 내려놓으며 말했다.\\n“대포 쏠 시간이 가까워졌군요. 노인장(웨믹의 아버지)의 기쁨이죠.” \\n\\u3000성(집)안으로 들어가자, 노인장이 부지깽이에 불을 댕기고 계셨다. 밤마다 행해지는 특별한 의식을 준비하며 그는 기대에 차 있었다.\\n\\u3000노인장에게서 빨갛게 달군  부지깽이를  받아  진지(대포  있는  곳)로 갈 시간이 될 때까지 웨믹은 손에 쥔 시계를 내려다보며 옆에 서 있었다.\\n웨믹이 부지깽이를 받아 밖으로 나갔다.\\n\\u3000곧 “쾅!”하며 귀청을 때리는 큰 굉음이 울려 퍼졌다. 어찌나 소리가 커든지 이 작은 사각형 집이 미친 듯이 흔들리는 바람에 산산조각이 나는 줄 알았다. 집 안에 있는 모든 유리컵들과 찻잔들이 “윙!”하고 울 렸다.\\n\\u3000이를 계기로, 내  생각에 두  팔꿈치로 자신의  안락의자에 단단히 붙여 있지 않았다면 방금 전 대포소리에 날라 가셨을 것 같은 이 노인장이 크게 기뻐하며  소리쳤다.\\n“쏘았다!  녀석이 쏘았어!”\\n\\u3000나는 이 노신사에게 고개를 끄떡여주었다. 내가 하도 많이 고개를 끄떡여드렸기 때문에 내가 그의 모습을 전혀 볼 수 없었다는 것은 단지  비유만은 아니다.\\n\\u3000대포 쏜 시간과 저녁 식사 시간 사이에, 웨믹은 헌신적으로 진기한 수집품들을  내게 보여주었다.\\n\\u3000대개 흉악한 특징들을 지니고 있는 물건들이었다. 예를 들면,  악명  높은 문서 위조에 사용되었다는 펜, 예리한 면도날 하나 또는 두 개, 누군가의 머리채(머리털)와, 유죄를 선고받은 범죄자가 이후 손으로 썼 다는 어느 자백서들 여러 장이 진열되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000이 자백서들에 대해, 웨믹 씨(변호사사무실 서기 및 출납담당직원)는  그 자신의 언어를 사용해가며 “하나하나가 죄다 거짓말들뿐입니다, 핍 씨.”라고 말했지만, 그 이유(죄다 거짓말)로 인해 그는 이 거짓 자백서들에 특별한 가치를 부여하고 있는 듯했다.\\n\\u3000이 수집품들은 ‘중국 도자기와 유리잔을 본 떠 만든 작은 견본들 사이와, 이 장식장의 소유자가 만든 것 같은 다양하고 솜씨 좋은 물건들 사이와, 노인장이 조각한 몇몇 스토퍼(파이프에 담배 채워 넣는 기구) 들 사이’에 기분 좋게 분산 배치되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000이들 모두는 내가 처음으로 안내받았던, 성(집)의 방에 진열되어 있었다. 그 방은 일반적인 거실로도 쓰이고 부엌으로도 쓰이는 방인 것 같았다.\\n방 안 ‘요리판 위’에 놓인 ‘스튜 냄비’(소스 냄비)를 보건대 그랬다. 벽난로 위에는 ‘고기 굽는 꼬챙이 회전기’를 정지시킬 때 사용할 용도로 고안된 것 같은 아기자기한 놋쇠공구도 하나 있었는데, 이 모든 것들로 판단해보건대 이 곳은 거실과 부엌 공용임이 틀림없었다.\\n\\u3000방안에는 그날 노인(웨믹의 아버지)을 돌보았던 말쑥한(솜씨 좋은) 여자아이도  하나 있었다.\\n\\u3000그 애가 저녁 식사 준비를 마쳤을 때, 그 여자애가 밖으로 나갈 수 있도록 다리가 내려졌다. 밤이 늦었으므로 집으로 돌아간 것이다.\\n\\u3000저녁식사는 훌륭했다.  비록 성 안(집 안)이 다소 건조하고 부식되어서 음식에 상한 견과(땅콩) 맛이 나고, ‘꿀돼지 우리가 좀 더 부엌에서 멀리 떨어져 있었으면’했지만, 난 그 날의 저녁식사 전부를 진심으로 즐겼다.\\n\\u3000그리고 웨믹이 내게 제공해준 성(집) 꼭대기 작은 침실엔 어떠한 불편함도 없었다. 내 머리와 깃대 사이에 있던 천장이 너무 얇아서, 내가 밤새도록 내 이마 위에서 깃대막대기의 균형을 유지해야 될 것만 같았지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000아침 일찍 웨믹이  내 방까지  올라왔다. 미안하게도  웨믹이 내  구두를 닦는 소리가  들렸다.\\n그 후, 웨믹은 정원을 손질하기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000내 방 고딕창문(중세 유럽의 교회 창문.  창살 있는 창문)을 통해,  나는 아버지께 일을 시키는 척하는 그를 볼 수 있었다. 그는 그러면서도 최대한 헌신적인 태도로 자신의 아버님을 향해 고개를 끄떡여주고 있 었다.\\n아침식사는  저녁식사만큼이나 훌륭했다.\\n\\u3000정확히 8시하고도 30분 더 흐른 후 우리는 ‘리틀 브리튼’(런던 북서 쪽에 있는 거리이름)을 향해  출발했다.\\n\\u3000걸어가는 동안, 사무실이 점점 가까워짐에 따라  웨믹은  점점  말이 없고 표정은 굳어져 갔다. 그리고 그의 입술이 우체통(입) 안으로 단단히 조여졌다.\\n\\u3000마침내, 우리가 사무실 앞에 다다랐을 때, 그리고 그가 외투 깃(목 부위)에서 열쇠를 꺼냈을 때, 그는 월워스(웨믹의 집)에 놓아두고 온 자신의 집을 깡그리 잊은 것 같이 보였다.\\n\\u3000그건 마치 자신의 성(집)과 도개교(들어 올리는 다리)와 나무그늘과 아래 정자와 호수 그리고 분수(샘)와 자신의 아버지에 대한 모든 기억을 “쾅!”하는 대포소리와 함께 공중으로 모두 날려 보낸 것만 같았다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 26장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000그러리라고(재거스 변호사가 주인공을 집으로 초대할 거라고) 웨믹 (서기)이 말했던 것처럼, 나는 ‘내 후견인(재거스 변호사)의 집’과 ‘내 후견인의 출납원이자 서기인 웨믹의 집’을 비교해 볼 수 있는 좋은 기 회를 일찍 가지게  되었다.\\n내 후견인은 집무실에서 향내 나는 비누로 손을 씻고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 월워스(웨믹의 공간=친밀한 공간)에서 사무실 안(재거스의 공 간=공적인 공간)쪽으로 발을 내딛었을 때 재거스 씨가 나를 자기 쪽으로 불러 더니, 웨믹이 말한 대로, 나와 내 동료들을 자신의 집으로 초대했다.\\n\\u3000“격식을 차릴 필요는 없네.” 그가 조건이랍시고 얘기했다. “야회복 재킷(007이 입는 양복과 나비넥타이)도 필요 없네. 그래 내일 어떤가.” “저희가 어디로 가면 되겠습니까?”라고 내가 묻자,  왜냐하면 난 도대체 그가 어디에 사는지조차 몰랐기 때문이다, 그는 이렇게 대답했다.\\n“내일 사무실로 오게. 내가 자네들을 집까지 안내하지.”\\n\\u3000나는 믿는다. 그가 그런 식으로 대답한 것은  미처 우리들보고  어디로 오라고 할지 생각하지 못한 자신을 인정하지 않으려는 일종의 반발심이었다.\\n\\u3000여기서 나는 이 얘기를 하고 싶다. 내 후견인은 자신의 의뢰인을 돌려보낼 때마다 손을 씻더라는 얘기 말이다. 그 행동은 마치 자신을 외과의사 혹은 치과의사로 여기는 듯 했다.\\n\\u3000그의 집무실에는 손 씻기를 위한 장비가 완벽하게 갖추어진 벽장이 하나 있었다. 그 벽장 안에는 향수 가게에서 갓 구입한 것처럼 향기로운  비누냄새가 났다.\\n그 벽장(세면대)에는 별나게 큰 회전식 타월(수건)이 롤러에 걸려 있었다. 물론 롤러는 문 안쪽에 달려 있었다.\\n\\u3000그는 손을 씻은 후, 이 회전식 타월 곳곳에 손을 비벼가며 물기를 말렸다.\\n\\u3000그는 즉결 심판소(경범죄자용)에서 돌아온 직후에도, 그리고 의뢰인에게 퇴거명령을 내린 직후에도 어김없이 이 벽장으로 가 손을 씻었다.\\n다음날 저녁 6시에 나와 내 친구들은 그의 사무실로 갔다.\\n\\u3000오늘은 그의 사건이 평소보다 더 암울한 양상을 뛰었을 모양이었다. 왜냐하면 우리가 갔을 때, 그가 손만 씻고 있는 것이 아니라 벽장(세면대) 속에 머리를 대고서 얼굴까지 씻고 목안을 헹구는 모습을 발견할 수  있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그는 심지어 세면을 다 마치고 회전식 타월을 돌돌 말아가며 닦고 나서, 작은 주머니칼을 꺼내 손톱에 낀 때(사건)를 문질렀다. 그런 후  코트  상의를 입었다.\\n\\u3000우리들이 거리로 나갔을 때 늘 그렇듯이 슬금슬금 다가오는 몇몇 사람들이 있었다. 그들은 내 후견인과 대화하고 싶어 하는 표정이 역력 했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 내 후견인의 영혼을 돌고 있는 비누향기 나는 광륜(천사머리 위 하얀 원)이 너무나도 단호했기 때문에(인상을 쓰고 있었기 때문에) 그들도 그날의 기다림을 그렇게 접을 수밖에 없었다.\\n\\u3000우리가 서쪽을 향해 계속 걸어가는 동안, 거리에 있던 군중들(사람 들)속에서 내 후견인을 알아보는 몇몇 사람들이 이따금씩 있었다. 그럴 때마다 내 후견인은 내게 더 큰 목소리로 얘기를 했다. 하지만 결코 누군가를 알아본다거나 또한 자신을 알아본 그들에게는 추호의 관심도 기울이지 않았다.\\n\\u3000그는 ‘소호(런던의 어느 타운이름)에 있는 제라드 거리’(당시엔 런던 서쪽에 있던 한적한 거리였음. 지금은 런던 중앙에 위치) 남쪽에 있는 어느 주택으로 우리를  안내했다.\\n\\u3000같은 종류의 집 치고는 격식을 갖춘 다소 으리으리한 집이었다. 다만 슬프게도 외벽에 페인트칠을 한 번 더 해야 할 것 같았다. 그리고 창문도 좀 많이  더러웠다.\\n\\u3000그가 열쇠를 꺼내 현관문을 열었다. 우리 모두는 현관으로 들어갔다. 현관은 돌로 지어져 있었다. 하지만 현관 자체는 횅댕그렁하고(허전하고) 약간 음침하고 별로 사용되지 않는 것 같은 인상을 풍겼다.\\n\\u3000그렇게 우리는 어두운 갈색 계단들을 밟으며  올라갔다.  2층에  어두운 갈색 방이 세 개 연달아 있었다. 그 안으로 들어갔다.\\n나무합판으로 된 벽들 위에 화환(꽃)들이 조각되어 있었다.\\n그는 그 화환들 사이에 서서 우리를 맞이하고 있었다. 그 화환들이 어떤 종류의 고리들을 닮았다고 내가 생각했던 일이 기억난다. \\n\\u3000정찬(코스요리)은 이 세 방 중에서 가장 좋은 방에 마련되어 있었다. 옆방은 옷 방(드레스 룸)이었고, 그 옆방은 침실이었다.\\n재거스 씨(런던의 유명변호사)는  우리들에게,\\n\\u3000“내가 이 집 전부를 소유하고 있네만 은, 이 세 방외에는 거의 사용 못하고  있네.”라고 말했다.\\n\\u3000식탁은 기분 좋게 놓여있었다. 물론 웨믹(변호사  사무실의 서기)이 말한 것처럼 은 식기는 눈을 씻고 찾아봐도 없었지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000그의 좌석 옆에는 널찍한 ‘식사 운반용 손수레’가 놓여 있었다. 손수레 위에는 ‘다양한 종류의 술병들’과 ‘마개 있는 유리병들’이 놓여 있었다. 그리고 후식을 위한 과일 접시도 4개 놓여있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 처음부터 끝까지 주목하고 있었다. 그가 모든 음식들을 자신의 손 가까이에 두고서 모든 음식들을 자신이 직접 분배했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000방에는 책꽂이도 하나 놓여있었다. 책등을 보고서 그 책들이 ‘증언, 형법, 범죄의 역사, 재판들, 의회의 법령들, 혹은 그와 유사한 종류의 책들’임을 알았다.\\n\\u3000방안에 있는 가구들은 모두 견고해보였고 우수해보였다. 마치 그가 가지고 있는 명품 ‘회중시계의 쇠줄(5천만 원짜리)’처럼 말이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이들 가구들은 사무적인 면을 지니고 있었고, 순수하게 장식 적인 측면은 하나도 찾아 볼 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000그 한쪽 구석에는 서류들과 ‘갓을 씌운 전등’이 놓여 있는 작은 테이블이 있었다.\\n\\u3000그것으로 보아선, 역시 그도 사무실 일을 집으로 가지고 와 밤에 보면서 계속 일에 몰두하는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000(잠깐 앞뒤설명 : 아직 등장인물 4명이 식사를 하기 전입니다. 재거스 씨와 주인공과 허버트는 이미 아는 사이입니다. 재거스 씨는 드러믈과 스타톱을 오늘 처음 봅니다.)\\n\\n\\u3000지금까지 재거스 씨는 내 세 명의 동료를 제대로 보지 못했다. 나와  함께  걸었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그가 종(음식 가져오라는 종)을 울린 후 ‘난로 앞에 까는 깔개’ 위에 서서 내 세 명의 동료들을 살피는 듯 한 표정을 지어보였다.\\n\\u3000놀랍게도 그는 곧 드러믈에게 주된 관심을  보였다.  그게  아니라면 오직 드러믈에게만 관심이 있는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000“핍.” 재거스 씨가 자신의 큰 손을 내 어깨 위에 얹으며 나를 창가로  이끌면서 말했다.\\n\\u3000“저 둘(드러믈과 스타톱)을 구별하지 못하겠군. 그래 저 거미 같은 친구는 누군가?”\\n“거미라뇨?”  내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“저기 저 친구 말이네, 온 사방으로 골이 나 있는 저 얼룩이 친구 말일세.”\\n\\u3000“벤틀리 드러믈(남작의 둘째아들)이에요.” 내가 대답했다. “얼굴이 섬세하게 생긴 애는 스타톱(주인공의 친구. 절친은 아님)이구요.”\\n\\u3000얼굴이 섬세하게 생긴 애에 대해서는 전혀 개의치 않은 채 그가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“벤틀리 드러믈? 그게 저 친구 이름인가? 그 표정한번 마음에 드는군.”\\n\\u3000재거스 씨는 즉시 드러믈(주인공의 라이벌)에게 말을 걸기 시작했다. 재거스 씨는 드러믈이 세련되지 못하고 말도 잘하지 못한다는 사실을 알고도 전혀 흔들림이 없었다. 오히려 바로 그 이유들로 인해 드러믈에게서 강제로 대화를 이끌어내려는 유혹을 느끼는 것 같았다. 나는 그들을  지켜보고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그때 식탁 위에 놓을 첫 번째 요리를 들고서 가사도우미가 그들과 나 사이로 걸어  들어왔다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 대략 40살 정도의 나이였다. 아니면 내가 그녀를 실제 나이보다 더 젊게 보았는지 모른다. 다소 큰 키에, 유연하고 날렵한 외형의 그녀는 극도로 창백한 얼굴을 하고 있었다. 그녀의 큰 눈들은 시들어 있었지만 풍성한 머리 결만은 찰랑이고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 마음에 어떤 병적인 애착이 있는지 두 입술을 떨어뜨린 채 새근거리고(두근거리고) 있었다. 그녀의 얼굴에는 미묘하고도 돌연한 그러면서도 내면의 동요가 날개 돋친 듯 드러나고 있었다. 하지만 나  혼자만의  상상이었는지도 모른다.\\n\\u3000나는 분명 그 하루 전 혹은 이틀 날 밤에, 「 맥베스 」 (셰익스피어 비극. 주인공 맥베스가 친척-스코틀랜드 왕-을 죽이고 그 부인과 왕국을 차지했다가 결국 죄의식에 미쳐 자신도 죽고 주변 인물도 죽는다. 아닌가?-_-;; ‘갈팡질팡하던 한 개인이 순간의 감정에  굴복해 악을 범하고 고통 받는다.’ 그러니까 이 맥베스라는 연극에서 악행을 저지르다 고통 받는 맥베스라는 주인공이 아니라, 가사도우미의 얼굴을 보자 왠지 그 주인공을 파멸로 몰아넣으며 반역을 하라고 부추긴 악한 마녀의 얼굴이 생각나더라는 내용이 『 위대한 유산 』 26장의 줄거리입니 다.-_-;; 남자를 파멸로 몰아넣은 여자~ 밑줄~ 횡설수설~)라는 연극을  보았음을 기억한다.\\n\\u3000게다가 그 가사도우미의 얼굴은, 마녀들의 가마솥에서 솟아오르던 얼굴들처럼, 불같은 공기를 내뿜으며 사방팔방으로 요동치고 있는 듯이 보였다(←제가 해석한 거^^ 완벽하네~ / 디킨스가 의도한 대로 해석한 거-_-;; → 불같이 타오르는 공기들에 의해 몹시 동요하고 있는 듯 보였다).\\n\\u3000그녀(가사도우미)가 접시를 내려놓았다. 그리곤 식사가 준비되었다는 것을 알릴 목적으로 손가락 끝으로 내 후견인의 팔을 살짝 터치하곤 이내 사라졌다.\\n\\u3000우리는 둥근 테이블에 자리를 잡고 앉았다. 스타톱이 다른 한쪽(주인공 후견인의 옆자리)에 앉는 동안 내 후견인은 드러믈에게 자신의 옆 자리에  앉게 했다.\\n\\u3000가사도우미가 식탁 위에 놓고 간 것은 값비싼 생선요리였다. 그 후 우리는 양고기  구이를 똑같은 몫을 나눠 먹었다. 그 후 새 요리를 똑같은 양으로 나눠  먹었다.\\n\\u3000양념들이며, 포도주들이며, 우리가 필요한 모든 물품들은 최고의 품 질이었다. 이 모두는 이 만찬의 주인이 자기 옆 ‘식사 운반용 손수레’에서 꺼내 우리에게  나눠주었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 그것들이 식탁을 한 바퀴 돌았을 때, 내 후견인은 항상 그것  들을 다시 집어 자기 옆 ‘식사 운반용 손수레’위에 올려놓았다.\\n\\u3000유사한 방식으로, 그는 각 코스가 시작될 때마다 깨끗한 접시들이며 나이프들이며 포크들을 우리에게 분배했다. 그리고 다 쓴 식기들은 자기 의자 옆 바닥에 놓여있던 두 개의 바구니에 즉각 즉각 내려놓았다.\\n\\u3000방금 전 그  가사도우미 외에는 식사시중을 드는 사람은 없었다. 코스가 시작될 때마다 그녀가 매번 요리를 들고 왔기 때문에 나는 그녀를 가까이에서 볼 수 있었고, 그럴 때마다 항상 그녀의 얼굴에서 내가 그 전날 밤에 본 「 맥베스 」 (연극, 비극) 속, 가마솥에서부터 피어오르 던  얼굴을 보았다.\\n\\u3000수년 후, 나는 그 여자의 무서운 형상을 만들어본 적이 있다. 어두운 방안에서 풍성한 머리 결을 제외하고는 어떤 자연적인 유사점도 없는 어느 얼굴을 불이 이글거리는 화주(알코올도수가 아주 높은 술) 한 사발 뒤로 지나가게 함으로써 나는 그 무서운 여자의 형상을 만들 수 있 었다.\\n\\u3000내가 그녀(가사도우미)를 특별히 주목하기 시작한 것은, 그녀의 찌를  듯 한 외모뿐 아니라 이 집을 방문하기 전에 이미 그녀에 대해 웨믹 (변호사사무실 서기)으로부터 귀띔을 받았기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000나는 그녀가 방안으로 들어올 때마다 주목하고 있었다. 그녀의 눈은 내 후견인의 안색을 살피는 데 열중해 있었고, 그(재거스 변호사) 앞에 어떤 접시를 놓든지 간에 자신의 두 손을 접시에서 머뭇거리며 빼려고 한다는 것이다. 마치 자기를 되부르는 것을 극히 염려하는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그리고 자기가 가까이 있을 때 그가 말해 주었으면 하는 듯했다. 만약 그가 그녀에게 할 말이 있으면 말이다.\\n\\u3000그도 이것을 알고 있다는 것을 그의 태도에서 나는 탐지해낼 수 있었다. 적어도 내가 본 것 같았다. 그의 태도 어딘가에는 그녀에게 이런 지속적인 긴장감을 불어넣으려는 요소가 있었다.\\n\\u3000드러믈(주인공의 라이벌)은 점점 쾌활해졌다. 비록 내 후견인(재거스 변호사)이 대화를 이끌어 가기보다 따라가고 있는 것 같았지만 말이다. 그가 지금 우리 네 명에게서 우리 기질의 가장 약한 부분들을 확 비틀었다는 것을 나는  알았다.\\n\\u3000내 경우, 나는 어느 틈엔가 내가 돈을 함부로 쓰려는 경향이 있다는  것과 내가 마치 허버트의 후원자인 양 굴려는 경향이 있다는 것과, 내 전도유망한 앞날에 대해  지나치게  남들에게  뽐내려는  경향이  있음을 내 입으로 말하고  있었다.\\n\\u3000우리 모두 그랬다. 하지만 우리 중 어느 누구도 드러믈보단 더 심하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000우리들을 내켜하지 않고 널 의심하며 조롱하고 싶어 했던 그의 경향이, 첫 번째 요리였던 생선요리가 채 치워지기도 전에, 그의 내면세계 로부터 끄집어 내어쪘던  것이다.\\n\\u3000대화(이야기)가 우리의 노  젓기  실력으로 옮겨지고, 카약킹(카누잉) 을 할 때마다 드러믈(주인공의 라이벌)이 그 특유의 양서류 같이 느린 자세로 야밤에 우리 카약 뒤를 쫓아오는 것 때문에 조롱을 받은 것은 생선요리 먹을 때가 아니라 치즈요리가 나왔을 때였다.\\n\\u3000이런 조롱에 대해,  드러믈은 내 후견인에게 “전, 저  딴 녀석들과  같이 가느니 혼자  가는 게  좋았을 뿐입니다.  카약킹 기술에 관해 말하자 면 전 저것들의  선생님보다  훨씬  뛰어나며,  근력에  관해  얘기하자면 전 저것들을 곡식의 겉껍질처럼 쫓아 버릴 수 있을 정도로 강합니다.”라고 알렸다.\\n\\u3000이때 내 후견인이 눈에 띄지 않는 몇 가지 방식으로 드러믈을 자극했고, 결국 드러믈은 웃자고 한 이 사소한 얘기들에 죽자고 덤벼들었다.\\n\\u3000드러믈이 자신의 팔을 드러내며 그곳에 얼마나 많은 근육이 있는지 보이기 시작했다. 우리도 웃기는 방식으로 우리의 팔뚝을 내보이며 얼마나 굵은지 자랑하기  시작했다.\\n\\u3000한편 그때는 가사도우미가 식탁을 치우고 있을 때였다. 그녀에겐 전혀 신경 쓰지 않으면서 그녀로부터 얼굴을 옆쪽으로 돌리던 그(재거스 변호사)가, 자신의 집게손가락 옆쪽을 이빨로 깨물면서 길길이 날뛰는 드러믈에게 관심을 보이며 자신의 의자 등에 푹 기대는 것이다. 그가 왜 드러믈 같은 녀석에게 그토록 관심을 보이는지 나로선 도저히 이해할  수 없었다.\\n\\u3000갑자기 그때, 그가 자신의 커다란 손으로  가사도우미의  손목을  확 낳아 챘다. 올가미에 걸린 새를 낳듯이. 그녀가 막 식탁을 가로지르며 그녀의 손을 뻗었을  때였다.\\n\\u3000너무나 갑작스런 일이었고 여자를 상대로 너무나 강압적이었으므로, 우리 모두는 놀라 방금 그 하찮은 팔뚝 굵기 재기를 멈출 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“힘의 세기에 관해 말하잔 말인가?” 재거스 씨(런던의 유명변호사이자 주인공의 후견인)가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“그럼 이 손목(가사도우미의 손목)을  보여주고  싶군.  몰리(그녀  이름. 독자가 이 이름을 전혀 기억할 필요가 없음. 다시 안 나오는 이름임. 이 상황이 중요함), 저들에게 네 손목을 보여드려라.”\\n\\u3000덫에 걸린 한쪽 손이 식탁 위로 보였지만, 반대쪽 손은 이미 자신(가 사도우미)의 허리 품 뒤로 감춘 상태였다.\\n\\u3000“선생님.”  그녀가 낮은 목소리고 말했다. 그녀의 두 눈은 정중하면서도 간청하듯 그에게 고정되어 있었다. “제발요.”\\n\\u3000“네 손목을 보여드려야겠다.”  재거스  씨가  단호한  태도로  다시  한 번 더 말했다. “몰리, 저들에게 네 손목을 보여드려라.”\\n“선생님.” 그녀가 다시 한 번 중얼거렸다. “제발!”\\n\\u3000“(큰소리로) 몰리.” 재그스 씨가 여전히 그녀에게서 얼굴을 돌린 채 그리고 방 반대쪽 편으로 시선을 집요하게 고정시킨 채 말했다. “어서 저들에게 네 두 손목을 보여드려라. 보여드려, 어서!”\\n\\u3000그녀의 손에서 손(그의 손)을 치운 후 그가 그녀의 손목을 식탁 위로 올렸다. 그녀도 허리 품에 감추었던 다른 쪽 손을 가져와 두 손을 나란히 올렸다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 끝까지 숨기려고 했던 다른 쪽 손목은 심하게 훼손되어 있었다. 손목을 가로지르며 곳곳에 깊은 상처가 아물어 흉터가 심하게 남아 있었다.\\n\\u3000두 손을 내밀며,  그녀가 재거스 씨에게서 눈을 떼어 연속해서  우리   한 명 한 명을 조심스럽게 바라보았다.\\n\\u3000“여기에 힘이 있소.” 재거스 씨가 자신의 집게손가락으로 그녀 손에 난 힘줄을 쫓으며 냉랭하게 말했다. “이 여성이 가지고 있는 손목 힘을 당해낼 남성은 몇 없소. 이 두 손이 얼마나 상대를  강하게 움켜잡을 수 있는지만 주목하시오. 나는 지금까지 수많은 손들을 보아올 기회가 있었지만, 손아귀 힘만 따지자면, 나는 여태껏 남성의 손에서든 여성의 손에서든지 간에, 그녀의 이 두 손보다 더 강한 손을 본 적이 없소.”\\n\\u3000그(재거스 씨, 런던의 유명한 변호사)가 느긋하고 비판적인 방식으로 이러한 얘기들을 하는 동안, 그녀(가사도우미)는 우리가 앉아 있는 좌 석순서대로 우리를 한 명 한 명씩 가만히 바라보았다.\\n그가 말을 멈추는 순간 그녀가 다시 그에게로 눈을 돌렸다.\\n\\u3000“이제 됐다, 몰리(가사도우미의 이름).” 재거스 씨가 그녀에게 살짝 고개를 끄떡여 보이며  말했다.\\n“모두가 널 넋을 잃고 바라보는구나, 이제 가도 좋다.” 그녀가 손을 거둔 뒤 방을 빠져나갔다.\\n\\u3000‘식사 운반용 손수레’에서 디캔터(TV에 나오는 고급 와인 병)를 꺼낸 재거스 씨가 유리잔에 와인을 채운 후 우리들에게 하나씩 돌렸다.\\n\\u3000“9시 하고도 반이 지났네, 제군들.” 그가 말했다. “오늘은 여기서 끝내야할 것 같네. 자네들에게 주어진 시간을 최대한 활용하게. 이렇게 만나게 되어 기뻤네. 드러믈 씨(주인공의 라이벌), 난 자네를 위해 건배하겠네.”\\n\\u3000건배할 때, 드러믈(주인공의 라이벌)을 지목한 목적이 만약 드러믈을 더욱 기고만장하게 만들기 위함이었다면 완벽하게 먹혀들었다.\\n\\u3000못마땅하고 성난 빛에 더욱더 취한 드러믈이 결국 우리들에 대해 기분 나쁜 멸시의 감정을 보이더니 점점 더 공격적으로 변해 마침내 우리들이 도저히 참을 수 없을 정도가 되었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그가 이러한 꼴불견의 단계를 하나씩 밟는 동안, 재거스 씨도  똑같이 이상한 관심을 보이며 그를 뒤쫓고 있었다.\\n\\u3000재거스 씨가 와인을 마시는 데, 드러믈이 실제로 기분 좋은 자극제 역할을 하는 것  같았다.\\n\\u3000분별력이 부족한 사내아이들 마냥, 유감스럽게도 우린 그날 와인을 지나치게 많이 마셨던 것이다. 그리고 우린 지금 말을 너무 많이 하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000우리는 특히 “너희들은 돈 귀한 줄 몰라. 죄다 걸러먹었어.”라는 취지로 한, 드러믈의 다소 천박한 냉소(조롱)에 골(열)이 냈다.\\n\\u3000그 말에 분별(신중함)보단 골이 난 나는 결국 “1주일 전 혹은 그쯤에 네가 스타톱(친구)에게서 돈을 빌려갈 때 나도 그 자리에 있었어. 그런데 지금 와서 그런 식으로 말하면 너무 무례한 거 아냐.”라고 말 하기에 이르렀다.\\n“흥.” 드러믈이 삐딱하게 말했다. “(빌린 돈은) 곧 갚을 거야.”\\n\\u3000“내 말은 네가 갚지 않으려 한다는  게 아니었어.” 내가 말했다.  “다만, 네가 우리와 우리의 돈에 관해 얘기를 꺼낼 땐 좀 더 조심하는 것이 옳았다는 거야. 내 생각은 그래.”\\n\\u3000“네 생각이 그렇다고!” 드러믈이 또 비꼬며  말했다.  “하느님  맙소사!”\\n\\u3000“한 마디만 더 할까?” 아주 심한 말을 할 작정으로 내가 얘기를 계속했다. “그러면서도 넌 만약 우리가 돈을 필요로 할 땐 단 한 푼도 빌려주지  않을 거야.”\\n\\u3000“그래 맞아.” 드러믈이 말했다. “난 네 딴 놈들에겐 단 돈 만원도 빌려주지 않을 테니까. 난 어느 누구에게도 만 원짜린 빌려주지 않을 거야.”\\n\\u3000“그러면서도 넌 우리한테서 돈을 빌려 가냐? 좀 비열한 거 아냐. 내 생각은 그런데.”\\n\\u3000“네 생각이 그렇다고.” 드러믈이 되풀이 말했다.  “오  하느님  맙소사!”\\n\\u3000그의 마지막 말은(“네 생각이 그렇다고”라는 드러믈의 말) 나를 아주  화나게 만들었다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 그의 성잘 못된 아둔함에 부딪힌 나머지 내가 어떤 응수의 방법도 찾지 못하고 있었기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000나는 너무 화가 난 나머지 나를 제지하는 허버트(주인공의 절친)의 노력들을 무시하고 드러믈에게 이렇게  말했다.\\n\\u3000“자, 드러믈 씨(원래는 주인공과 동갑임, 모두 25세임), 마침 얘기한  번 잘 했어. 네 녀석이 그 돈을 스타톱에게서 빌러갈 때, 여기 있는 허버트(친구)와 나 사이에 어떤 말이 오고 갔는지 말해볼까.”\\n\\u3000“네 딴 녀석들 사이에 무슨 말이 오고 갔던 내 상관할 바 아냐.” 드러믈이 화난 목소리로 말했다. 그리면서 더 낮은 목소리로 이렇게 투 덜대는  것 같았다.\\n\\u3000“젠장, 저 딴 녀석들(주인공과 허버트) 지옥에 떨어져 한 번 굴러봐야 되는데.”\\n\\u3000“네가 듣고 싶어 하든 듣고 싶지 않아 하든, 이 얘기는 꼭 하고 말겠다.” 내가 말했다. “우린 이렇게 말했지.  네가 돈을  빌려  호주머니 속에 집어넣을 때 굉장히 기뻐하더라고, 그리고 스타톱이 네 녀석에게 돈을 빌려줄 만큼 마음이 약한 것을 몹시 즐기는 것 같다고.”\\n\\u3000드러믈(주인공의 라이벌)이 노골적으로 비웃었다. 그리고 두 손을 호 주머니에 찔러 넣은 채 자신의 둥근 어깨를 들썩이며 우리 면전에다   대놓고 비웃으며 앉아  있었다.\\n\\u3000그 행동은 내 말이 모두 맞음을 솔직히  인정한다는 태도이며,  그리고 ‘너희 모두를 바보 얼갈이로써 경멸한다.’는 의미 그 이상도 그 이하도 아니었다.\\n\\u3000상황이 이렇게 되자, 스타톱(여자 같은 남자)이 굳은 표정으로 “좀 더 상냥하게 구는 게 좋겠어.”라며 드러믈에게 강력히 권고하기에 이르렀다. 물론 그 권고는 내 막말보다 훨씬 더 예의를 차린 것이었다.\\n\\u3000스타톱은 활기차고 총명한 청년(25세)이었다. 하지만 드러믈은  정확히  그 반대였다.\\n\\u3000그래서인지 드러믈은 스타톱이 뭔 말을 해도 완전 짜증을 내는 경향이 있었다. 예의 바른 충고를 자신에 대한 직접적인 모욕으로 여기기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000드러믈이 상스럽고 멍청한 말로 맞받아쳤다. 그래서 스타톱이 좀 가벼운 농담으로 이 논의(대화)를 비껴나려 했다. 그 농담에 우리 모두   크게 웃었다.\\n\\u3000그 어떤 것보다도 이 작은 성공(농담+웃음)이 드러믈을 극도로 분노케 했다.\\n\\u3000어떤 위협도 그리고 어떤 경고도 없이, 드러믈이 다자고자 자신의 호주머니에서 두 손을 빼더니 자신의 둥근 어깨를 낮추면서 쌍욕을 하고는 앞에 있던 큰 와인 잔을 집어 들며 자신의 적(스타톱)의 머리에   집어  던지려 했다.\\n만약 드러믈이 와인 잔을 들어 올렸을 때 이 모임의 주최자(재거스 변호사)가 예의 그 비상한 손재주로 그 즉시 와인 잔을 낙아 채지 못 했다면 드러믈의 이 깡패 같은 짓은 성공하고 말았을 것이다.\\n\\u3000“자, 제군들.” 재거스 씨(런던의 유명 변호사이자 주인공의 후견인) 가 와인 잔을 신중하게 내려놓으며 그러면서 크고 무거운 자기 시곗줄을 잡아 순금회중시계를 꺼내 들면서 말했다.\\n\\u3000“벌써 9시 하고도 30분이 지나간다는 사실을 유감스럽지만 말할 수 밖엔 없네.”\\n\\u3000이 말을 신호로, 우린 가려고 자리에서 일어났다. 우리가 주택 현관  문에 다다르기 전에 스타톱이 방금 그 일은 잊자는 의미에서 “어이 친구.”하고 드러믈을 명랑하게  불렀다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이 영감탱이는 그런 호의를 받을 만한 주변머리도 없었다. 우리들이 해머스미스(런던서쪽 템스 강 옆)까지 걸어가는 동안, 드러믈은 길 같은 편에서 우리와 같이 걸으려고 조차 하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000시내(바너드 여관 = 허버트 집 = 런던시내서쪽)에 남기로 한 ‘허버트와 내’가 뒤돌아보니, 드러믈과 스타톱은 서로 반대쪽 편에서 거리를 따라 내려가고 있었다.(드러믈과 스타톱은 하숙집으로 돌아가고 있음. 하숙집은 당시 기준으로 런던 서쪽 경계선 너머 인근지역에 있음)\\n\\u3000스타톱이 앞장서 가고, 드러믈이 주택들의 그림자 속에서 뒤떨어져가고 있었다. 드러믈이 카약킹(카누잉)을 할 때 따라가는 습관이 있긴 하지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000현관문이 아직 안 닫힌 상태였다. 허버트(주인공의 절친)에게 “잠시만 있어봐”라고 말한 후 내 후견인(재거스 변호사)에게 사과를 할 목 적으로 난 계단을 뛰어  올라갔다.\\n\\u3000부츠(신발)들로 둘러싸인 드레스룸(옷 방) 안에서, 그는 벌써 우리를 떼어내기 위한 손 씻기에  한창(열심)이었다.\\n\\u3000“드릴 말씀이 있어서요. 좀 전에 식사자리에서 있었던 불쾌하신 일에 대해 다시 한 번 사과드립니다. 그 일로 절 너무 많이 비난하지 말 아주셨으면 합니다.”\\n\\u3000“풋!” 그가 얼굴을 세차게 씻으며 그리고 물방울들이 떨어지는 사이로 말했다. “별일도 아닌 것을, 핍(주인공 이름). 그렇지만 난 그 ‘거미 녀석(싸가지 없는 드러믈)’이 마음에  들었네.”\\n\\u3000그런 후 그는 내 쪽으로 몸을 돌리더니, 자기 머리를 흔들면서 입으로 바람을 불면서 수건으로 얼굴을 닦고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“그 녀석을 좋아하신다니  다행입니다, 선생님.”  내가  말했다. “하지만  전 그다지….”\\n\\u3000“아니네, 아니야.” 내 후견인이 동조하며 말했다. “그 친구와 너무 가까이 지내진 말게. 자네가 할 수 있는 한에서 그와 거리를 유지하게. 하지만 난 그 녀석이 맘에 든단 말이야, 핍. 그 녀석은 진짜 물건이야. 이런, 내가 마치 점쟁이 같이 말하는군.”\\n그가 타월(수건) 너머로 나와 눈이 마주쳤다.\\n\\u3000“하지만 난 점쟁이가 아니니까….” 그는 꽃장식이 그려진 타월 속으로 머리를 집어넣으며 두(2) 귀를 타월로 열심히 닦으며 이렇게 말했다. “자네는 내가 무엇에 대해 말하는지 알겠지? 좋은 밤 되게, 핍(주 인공이름)군.”\\n“예, 안녕히 계세요,  선생님.”\\n\\u3000그 일이 있고 대략 한 달이 더 지났을 때였다. ‘거미 인간(드러믈)’ 의 시간도 영원히 끝나게 되었다. 죽었다는 얘기가 아니라(← ^.^ 제가 지어냈음), 포킷 씨(신사교습강사) 집에서의 하숙생활을 마치고 자기 가문이 있는 ‘서머셋’(영국 남서부의 주. 25장 #1참조)으로 되돌아가게 되었다는 얘기다. 포킷 씨 부인(허영심이 많은 여자)을 제외하곤 이 집에 있는 모두가 대단히  기뻐했다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 27장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000(27장 앞부분은 비디가 주인공에게 보낸 편지 내용입니다. 비디는 여자 이름입니다. 그녀는 주인공이 시골에 살 때 서로 연인으로  발전하는 단계 직전에 이별한 여성입니다. 비디는 주인공을 좋아하는데, 주인공은 다른

구나.\\n\\n“정말 신난다.”라고.\\n\\n(여기까지가 비디의 편지 끝입니다.) \\n\\n\\u3000나는 이 편지를 월요일 아침에 우편으로 받았다. 그러므로 편지에서 말하고 있는 방문일자는 내일이었다. 여기서 내가 어떤 감정들을 지니 고서 이 방문을 기대했는지를 정확하게 고백해야겠다.\\n\\u3000기쁜 마음이 아니었다. 비록 그와 나 사이에 어릴 적부터 끈끈한 유 대관계로 맺어 있었음이 분명하지만, 난 그의 방문이 전혀 반갑지 않 았다. 차라리 내  생활의  방해로,  차라리  나에 대한  고행으로,  차라리 내 과거와 현재에 대한 부조화를 남들에게 들추어낼 예리한 칼날로 그를  인식하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000만약 몇 푼 집어주고 그(조)를 오지 못하게 할 수 있었다면 난 기꺼이 돈을 지불했을 것이다(못된 ○ -_-;; 하긴 이런 사람들이 너무 많아 탈이지만…).\\n\\u3000그나마 내가 안도의 한숨을 내쉴 수 있었던 것은, 그가 다른 어디도 아니고 버나드 여관(주인공과 주인공 친구의 숙소)으로 나를 찾아온다는 것이었다.\\n\\u3000만약 그가 해머스미스(런던서쪽 템스 강 옆, 주인공이 신사교육을 받고 있는 하숙집)로 나를 찾아와 허버트(친구)와 허버트의 아버지가 그를 알게 된다면, 그래서 내 과거(대장장이)를 어렴풋하게나마 알게 된 다면….\\n\\u3000물론 허버트와 허버트의 아버지가 조(매형)를 만나는 것에 내가 크게 반대할 이유는 없었다. 하지만 그(조)의 존재가 드러믈에게까지 알 려질 수도 있다는 생각에 난 극도로 민감해졌던 것이다. 내가 경멸하는 바로 그 드러믈에게  말이다.\\n\\u3000그래서 전 생애를 통해 우리 내면의 가장 나약한 부분과 저열한 단 면(모습)들이, 대개는 각자가 가장 경멸하는 사람들 때문에 들통 나는 것이다.\\n\\u3000나는 방들을 다소나마 아주 불필요하고 과다한 방법 혹은 다른 것들로 매번 장식하기 시작했었는데, 다 떨어져가는 버나드 여관과 그런 씨름을 하는 것은 지나치게 비용이 많이 드는 것으로 판명이 났었다.\\n\\u3000이때쯤, 방들은 내가 이곳에 처음 왔을 때보다 판이하게 달라져 있었다. 또한 인근에 있는 실내 장식업자의 장부에 중요한 페이지 몇 장을 내 이름으로 장식하는 명예를 누리기도 했다.\\n\\u3000최근에는 이런 내 소비성향이 가빠르게 상승해  나는  심지어  장화, 그냥 장화가 아니라 승마용 장화를 신은 심부름꾼 아이 한 명을 고용 하기에 이르렀다. 그래서 내가 차라리 그 심부름꾼 아이에게 매일 매일을 속박당하고 구속당한다는 말을  들어도  좋을  지경에까지  이르렀 다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면, 내가 괴물(심부름꾼 아이)을 만들고 난후, 그 아이는 우리 집을 드나들던 어느 직업 세탁부의 쓰레기 같은 자식이었다, 나는 그 쓰레기 같은 녀석에게 푸른 코트를 입히고, 카나리아(종달새와 비슷한 새)가 그려진 양복 조끼와, 휜 색 넥타이, 그리고 크림(흰색) 같은 반 바지와, 앞서 언급한 그 망할 놈의 승마용 장화까지 구입해 입혔기 때 문이다.\\n\\u3000그리곤 정작 그 녀석에게 시킨 일이라고는 극히 사소한 몇 가지 심 부름뿐이었고, 대신 녀석에게 엄청난 양의 식사를 제공해야했던 것이다.\\n\\u3000이런 불쾌한 두 가지 요구사항들을 맞추려다보니 그 녀석은 내 생활에 계속해서 문제가  되었다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 복수(보복)의 유령(비용이 많이 들게 하는 심부름꾼 소년)에게 “화요일 아침 8시엔 홀에서 꼼짝 말고 있어, 응.”라고 지시를 내렸다. 홀은 마루깔개를 깔아놓은 가로 세로 각각 30×60센티미터 정사각 형이었다.\\n\\u3000허버트(주인공의 절친)는 조(주인공의 매형)가 좋아할만한 아침식사로 몇 가지를 제안했다. 그런 관심과 배려에 그에게 진심어린 고마움을 느끼면서도, 나는 ‘만약 조(대장장이)가 너(허버트)를 만나러 올라오고 있다고 해도, 네가 그렇게 활발하게 행동할 수 있었을까?’라는 이상 하고 반쯤은 약이 오른 느낌을 지울 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000어쨌든 조를 맞이하기 위해 나는 월요일 밤에  런던시내(버나드  여관)로 들어갔다. 다음날 아침 일찍 일어난 나는 ‘거실’과 ‘아침 식사용 식탁’이 가장 멋져 보이게끔  취해놓았다.\\n\\u3000불행히도 아치부터 보슬보슬 이슬비가 내렸다. 상황이 이쯤 되니 아기 천사가 와도 “두레(우물)박 틀의 ‘다소 눈물 많은 거인’처럼, 버나드 여관이 창문 밖으로 검댕투성이의(거무스름한) 눈물을 샘솟듯 내뿜고 있다는 사실”을 감추려야 감출 수가 없었다.\\n\\u3000시간이 다가올수록 도망가고 싶었다. 하지만 이 망할 놈(심부름꾼 소년)이 내 지시(오늘은 꼼짝 말고 홀에 서 있어!)를 충실히 따른답시고 홀(30×60센티미터의 협소한 정사각형 공간)에 버티고 있는 통에 눈치가 보여 도망갈 수도  없었다.\\n\\u3000곧 누군가 계단을 밟고 올라오고 있는 소리가 들렸다. 조(매형이름)라는 것을 알 수 있었다. 계단을 올라오는 소리가 너무 서투였기 때문이다. 자기 발보다 엄청 큰 장화를 지금도 신고 있는 것이 분명했다. 올라오면서 머무는 층들마다 방문에 걸린 이름패들을 읽기 위해 오래 지체하고 있었는데 분명  조(매형이름)였다.\\n\\u3000마침내 그가 내 방을 찾았다. 그가 손가락 끝으로 내 명패에 적힌  글자를 하나씩  더듬는 소리가 들렸다. 곧 그가 숨을 한 번 크게 내쉬는 소리가 열쇠구멍 사이로  들려왔다.\\n결국 그가 아주  미약한  강도로(힘으로)  가볍게  방문을  두드렸다. 그러자 이 상황파악 못하는 망할 놈의 ‘페퍼’(심부름꾼 소년의 이름.\\n비중이 극히 낮은 조연. 독자가 알 필요 없는 이름임. 다시 안 나오는 이름임. 물론 등장은 가끔씩 함)가 큰소리로 이렇게 말했다.\\n“미스터  가저리 씨!”\\n\\u3000문을 열기 전에, 나는 조(매형이름)가 장화 바닥 닦는 일을 그만두지 않을 것  같다는 생각이 들었다. 그래서 내가 먼저 문을 열고  나가 그를 매트(바닥깔개)에서 떼어내 와야 할 것 같았다. 바로 그때 조(매형 이름)가 들어왔다.\\n“조(매형이름),  반가워요, 조?”\\n“그래, 핍(주인공이름) 신수(겉모습의 느낌)가 훤하구나, 핍?”\\n\\u3000온통 상기되고 달아오른 너무도 순박한 얼굴로 그와 나 사이의 바닥에 자신의 모자를 내려놓은 후, 그가 내 두 손을 잡으며, 마치 내가 최근에 특허 받은 펌프인 마냥, 일직선으로 위로 일직선으로 아래로 흔 들어댔다.\\n“만나서 반가워요, 조. 모자는 이리 주세요.”\\n\\u3000하지만 조는 자신의 두 손으로 조심스럽게 모자를 다시 주워들더니  모자 안에 알들이 든, 새의 둥지를 들고 있는 마냥 자신의 소유물(모자)을 건네 달라는 내 말을 듣으려 하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000그는 지금 이 세상에서 가장 불편한 자세로 인사말을 나누며 서 있으려 했다.\\n\\u3000“그동안 많이 컸구나, 핍….” 조(매형, 착하지만 많이 어리석은 사람임, 58세)가 말했다. “살도 졌고…, 더 젊잖아 졌어….”  조는  이런 고상한 단어들을 떠올리기 위해 조금씩 뜸을 들었다. “넌 국왕폐하와 이 나라에 명예가 되었어,  핍.”\\n“조도 마찬가진데 뭘, 내가 떠나올 때보다  훨씬  말끔해졌어.” “고맙구나!” 조가 말했다. “(당시 영국 하층 노동자 계급의 말투로←\\n절대 나쁜 뜻 없음-_- 오해하시면 안 됨... 구글에서 해당 단어 검색되는 대로 쓴 것임 / 즉  철자 한두 개씩을 발음이 비슷한 엉뚱한 철자로 바꾸어 말하며 →) 나야 늘 그렇지, 핍. 하지만 내 누나(50세)는 아직 몸을 가누지 못한단다. 비디(여자이름, 28세)가 늘 옆에서 챙겨주고 있지. 그리고 친구들도 ‘더 좋아진 것이 없으니 더 나빠진 것도 없어’ (선주문이 없으니 이월상품도 없어). 하지만 웹슬 씨(교회서기)만은  조금  하락이 있었단다.”\\n\\u3000이렇게 조(매형)가 자신의 두 손으로 ‘새의 둥지’(모자)를 조심스럽게 쥐고 있는 동안, 그의 두 눈들은 방을 빙글빙글 돌고 있었고, 내 가운 (잠옷 위의 가운)에 박힌 꽃무늬패턴을 보면서도 두 눈이 빙글빙글 돌고 돌았다.\\n“추락이  있었다고, 조?”\\n\\u3000“이런 내 정신 좀 보게.” 조가 풀이 죽은 목소리로 말했다. “응, 웹 슬(교회서기)이 교회서기 일을 관두었단다, 본격적으로 연극계에 뛰어 들어 보겠대. 마찬가지 이유로 연극하겠다고 나를 따라  런던으로  온 거고. 그게 그의  바램이었으니까.”\\n\\u3000조가 잠시 ‘새둥지’(모자)를 왼쪽 겨드랑이에 끼더니, 오른손으로 알(새알)이라도 찾겠다는 양 모자 안을 손으로 더듬으며 말했다.\\n“네가 기분 나빠하지만 않는다면, 나보고 이걸 너에게….” \\n\\u3000나는 조가 건네는 것을 받았다. 그것은 쭈글쭈글 구겨진  ‘매트로폴리  탄 시어터’(공연장)의 ‘연극 광고 안내문’이었다. 거기엔 명연기로 이름을 떨친 지방의 어느 유명한 아마추어 연기자의 사상 첫 출연작이라는 문구가 적혀 있었다.  또한   〈 국민  음유시인의  가장 비극적인  도보 여행 〉 (←디킨스가 지어낸 연극 제목임)이라는 연극에서 그가 보인 전대 미문의 연기력은 지방연극계에선 이미 어마어마한 센세이션(성공)을 일으켰다는 문구도 같이 적혀  있었다.\\n“이 공연에 있었어? 조.” 내가 물었다.\\n\\u3000“그래, 핍.” 자신이 그 공연에 있었음을 강조하는 말을 하면서도 어째 그의 표정이 밝아보이지가  않았다.\\n“정말  연극이 대성공이었어?”\\n\\u3000“그게 좀.” 조(주인공의 매형)가 말했다. “물론, 틀림없이 오렌지 껍질들이 한 무대기 날아들었지만. 그(웹슬 씨, 교회서기 때려치우고 런던연극계에 띄어든 코믹한 인물)가 유령(극중에서 웹슬의 아버지)을 목 격하는 장면에서 특히 그랬지. 질문 같을 수 있지만, 선생(주인공을 선 생이라고 처음 불렀음, 이후 계속 선생이라고 부르며 신사가 되어가는 주인공을 어려워함.), (옛 말투로→) 자신과 유령 사이에 참견하며 계 속해서 ”아멘! 아멘!”이라고 하는 것이, 멀쩡한 정신으로 자기 배역에 열중하고 있는 배우에게 할 짓이오? 어떤 사람이 잠깐 다른 일을 할    수도 있고 그래서 교회에 몸담았을 수도 있지 그걸….”\\n\\u3000조가 힘이 빠진 목소리로 다소 감성적이며 논쟁적인 어조 말을 이어 갔다.\\n\\u3000“그렇다고 그 상황에서  쓰레기를 던져야했느냐는  것이오. 그러니까  제 말은, 배우가 ‘유령이 된 자기 아버지’에게 집중하는 것도 허락하지 않으면서  어쩌라고, 안  그렇소, 선생?  하물며, 그(웹슬)가 대성통곡하는 장면에서도 그래, 안타깝게도 입고 있던 검은색 의상(옷)이 너무 작아 자꾸 흘러내리는 것을 당사자(웹슬)가 어쩔 줄 몰라 올려 입고 또   올려 입고하는데도 불구하고, 도대체 어떻게 오렌지 껍질을 배우에게….”\\n\\u3000마치 유령을 보는 것 같은 표정변화가 조(매형, 58세)의 얼굴에 나타 나고 있다는 사실을 내가 알아차리는 순간 허버트(절친, 25세)가 방으로  들어서고 있었다.\\n그래서 내가 허버트를 조에게 소개했다.\\n\\u3000허버트가 손을 뻗으며 악수를 청했다. 하지만 조는  뒤로  물러서며 ‘새의 둥지’(모자)에서 손을 떼려고 하지 않았다.\\n“황송합니다, 나리.” 조가 말했다. “핍과 나리는…?”\\n\\u3000이 부분에서 조의 두 눈이 이 망할 놈(비용이 많이 드는 심부름꾼 소년)에게 가 고정되었는데 정확히 녀석이 막 식탁 위에 토스트를 올 려놓을 때였다. 조의 두 눈에는 ‘저 애도 이 집의 꼬마신사 같은데. 그럼 내가 인사를 드려….’라고 생각하려는 표정이 너무도 명백했기 때문에 내가 짜증을 내며 그의 생각을 물리쳐야했다. 이것이 또 조를 무척 당황하게  만들고 말았다.\\n\\u3000“내 말의 의미는 그러니까 두 신사분이…, 이 좁은 장소에서 건강하게들 잘 지내시는지를 물으려고…? 그러니까 이곳은, 현재 런던의 관점에서 아마도 아주 좋은 여관일 테죠?”\\n\\u3000자시고 따지고 할 것도 없이 조가 속마음을 털어놓았다. 우리들의 차림새에 비해 여관이 너무나도 볼품없어 뭐가 뭔지 헷갈린다는 얘기 였다.\\n\\u3000“물론 호감 가는 여관이라 생각됩니다만, 저보고 여기서 살라면 이 곳에선 돼지 한 마리도 못 키우겠습니다. 물론 수퇘지 놈을 뚱땡이로 살찌워서 양념에 배겨 배터지게 먹을 생각이  아니라면  야  또  모를  까….  여긴 꼭….”\\n\\u3000실물보다 돋보이게 하는 이런 아부의 말로 우리 거주지의 장점(무너지기 일보직전)이 분명해졌다. 그런데 그때부터 조(매형, 58세)가 나를 “나리”이라고 부르는 경향을 보이기  시작했다.\\n\\u3000내가 조에게 식탁에 앉으라고 권하자 그는 자신의 모자를 놓아둘 적당한 장소를 물색하기 위해 방을 이리저리 둘러보았는데 마치 자신의 모자를 놓아둘 적당한 장소는 본질적으로 아주 희소한 물질 위여야 한다는 것처럼 그는 방을 이리저리 둘러보았다.\\n\\u3000그리고 궁극적으로 벽난로 위 선반 맨 끝자락에 그가 모자를 세워놓았다. 그때부터 모자는 시간적 간격을 두고 선반에서 끊임없이 떨어졌다.\\n\\u3000“차 드실래요? 아님 커피로 하실래요? 가저리 씨(주인공의 매형의 이름)” 아침마다 티(차)타임을 주재하는 허버트(주인공의 절친, 25세) 가 물었다.\\n\\u3000“아 감사합니다, 나리.” 조가 머리에서부터 발까지 경직되어선 말했다. “나리께서 주시는 걸로 아무거나 마시겠습니다.”\\n“그럼 커피로 하실  거죠?”\\n\\u3000“감사합니다, 나리.” 조가 ‘커피’라는 말에 명백히 의기소침해하며 대꾸했다. “나리께서 커피를 추천해주실 만큼 생각이 깊으신데, 제가 어떻게 그걸 마시고 싶진 않다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니까. 다만 조그만 한 걸로 하심 안 되시겠는지?”\\n\\u3000“아하, 차(먹는 차)로 하시겠다고요. 말씀을 하시죠.^^ 전 또….” 허버트가 차를 따르며  말했다.\\n\\u3000이때 조(주인공의 매형이름, 58세, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 사람)의 모자가 ‘벽난로 위 선반’에서 굴러 떨어졌다.\\n\\u3000그러자 조가 의자에서 뛰쳐나와 모자를 집어든 후 정확히 똑같은 위치에 모자를 세워놓았다. 마치 그 위치가 새의 둥지로써 가장 안정적인 장소인양. 곧 그의 모자가 다시 바닥으로 굴러 떨어졌다.\\n\\u3000“런던에는 언제 오셨습니까, 가저리 씨(주인공의 매형 이름)?” 허버 트(주인공의 절친, 25세)가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“그게 어제 오후였나요….” 조가 손으로 입을 가리며 기침을 연거푸 하더니 말했다. 런던에 도착했을 때부터 백일해(경련성  기침 발작)에 걸린  마냥 말이다.\\n\\u3000“아닙니다, 어제가 아닙니다. 그래, 아, 어제입니다. 아니, 확실히 어제 오후에 올라왔습니다.” 그가 지혜와 안심과 엄격한 공정함이 아우러진  표정으로 말했다.\\n“런던  구경은  좀  해보셨습니까,  가저리  씨?”  허버트가  말했다. “아뇨, 아, 예, 했습죠,  나리.”  조(대장장이)가 말했다.  “런던에  도착\\n하자마자 웹슬(교회서기)이랑 ‘구두약 창고’부터 갔는걸요. 근데 어째 구두약 창고 규모가 우리 시골 가게 문에 달린 빨간 광고지에 있던 건 물보단 못한 것 같지 뭡니까. 그러니까 제 말씀은….”\\n\\u3000조가 이 부분에서 꼭 부연설명이 필요하겠다는 태도로 이렇게 덧붙 였다.\\n\\u3000“광고지에는 훨씬 더 어~리어~리하~게(어리어리하게) 그려져 있었 거든요.”\\n\\u3000나는 조(매형)가 이 마지막 후렴구(“어리어리하게”)로 완전한 합창곡을 만들어서 아주 그냥 끝장을 낼 줄 알았다(계속 길게 발음할 걸로 정말 믿었다), 사실 그 말이 대단히 의미심장하게 내 마음 속에 떠올리게 하는 어떤 건축 양식이 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 하느님이 도우서 조는 넘어지려는 자신의 모자에 마음을 빼앗기고 말았다.\\n\\u3000사실대로 말하자면, 모자는 크리켓(방망이로 공을 쳐서 상대방 깃대 쓰러뜨리는 경기) 최종 수비수에게 요구되는 것과 정확히 똑같은 ‘끊임 없는 주의’와 ‘손과 눈의 민첩함’을 그에게 요구하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그는 모자로 기이한(이상한) 동작을 했고, 고난이도의 기술을 선보이기도 했다.\\n\\u3000어떨 때는 떨어진  모자로 황급히 뛰어가 깔끔하게 줍기도 하고, 어떨 때는 떨어지는 도중에 모자를 위로 확 쳐 올려 방 여기저기로 모자를 통통 치거나 벽 위에 있는 수많은 벽지패턴들에 부딪치며 모자를 아슬아슬하게 다루었다.\\n\\u3000그러다 그가 모자를 안심하고 쥘 수 있겠다 싶기도 전에  ‘식탁에서  찻잔 속의 찌꺼기 따위를 받는 그릇’ 속에 모자가 첨벙 떨어뜨리고 말았다.\\n결국 내가 실례를 무릅쓰고 그릇에서 모자를 빼앗아버렸다. \\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형)가 입고 있던 ‘셔츠 칼라’와 ‘코트 깃’에 대해 언급하자면, 둘 다 해결할 수 없는 수수께끼들이었다. 그의 복장들에서 패션에 대해 생각해보는 것 자체가 난센스였다.\\n\\u3000그는 도대체 왜  자신이  정장을  착용했다고  느끼기  전까지,  어떻게 저 정도로까지 스스로에게 찰과상(면도, 때  밀기)을  내야했더란 말인가?\\n\\u3000그는 도대체 왜 나들이옷들을 입기 위해 고통이란 통과의례를 통해 스스로를 정화(면도, 때 밀기)시켜야 한다고 생각할 수밖에 없었더란 말인가?\\n\\u3000게다가 그는 접시와 입 사이에서 포크를 멈추고는 일종의 설명할 길 없는 기이한 상념에 빠져들곤 했었는데,  그럴 때면 그의 두  눈들이  아주 이상한 방향들로 이끌렸고, 그러다 범상치 않게 심한 기침들 때문에 몸을 가누지 못하는 것이다.\\n\\u3000그는 식탁에서 아주 멀리 떨어져 않아 있어 입으로 가져가는 음식의 양보다 바닥에 떨어뜨리는 음식의 양이 훨씬 더 많았으며, 그럴 때마다 자신이 떨어뜨린 음식이 아닌 양 행동하려고 무진장 애를 쓰고 있었다.\\n\\u3000허버트 포킷(25세)이 회계사무실로 나가보겠다며 방에서 나갔을 때  난 진심으로 기뻐했다. (허버트는 회계사무실로 일하러 가는 것이 아니라, 여기저기 일자리며 경기가 어떻게 돌아가는지를 그리고 금융거리를 나다니는 경제인들을 둘러보고 오겠다는 의미입니다.)\\n\\u3000‘이것이 모두 내 잘못이라는 것과 만약 내가 조(매형)를 더 편안하게 대했었더라면 조도 또한 나를 더 편안해했으리라는 것’을 알만한 양식 (분별력)도 선의(호의)도 나는 가지고 있지 않았다.\\n\\u3000그에게 참다못해 화가 잔뜩 나있었는데, 조는 상황파악도 못하고 나를 더 화나게 했다(내 머리 위에 숯불을 수북이 쌓았다).\\n“이제 저희 둘뿐이고…, 나리.” 조가 말을 꺼냈다.\\n\\u3000“조!” 내가 너무 섭섭해서 그의 말을 자르며 말했다. “어떻게 나한테 ‘나리’라고 불러?”\\n\\u3000조는 질책(비난) 같은 어떤 표정을  힘없이 지어보이며 아주 짧은 순간 내 눈을  살폈다.\\n\\u3000그의 넥타이가 완전히 터무니없고 그의 옷깃이 완전히 불합리했음에  도, 나는 그의 눈빛에서 어떤 위엄을 느낄 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“이제 우리 둘만 남았으니까.” 조가 얘기를 다시 시작했다. “나는 더 머물 생각도 힘도 없어, 이제 결론을 내자면…,  최소한  말을  꺼내자면…, 내가 왜 여기 와서 호강을 누리는지를 설명을 하자면…, 왜냐하면 호강을 누리자는 게 내가 여기 온 목적이 아니니까….”\\n\\u3000명쾌한 해설이 필요할 때마다 그가 널 보이는 손짓, 몸짓을 취하며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“난 그저 네게 도움이 되었으면 하고, 신사들과 자리를 같이하고 식사를 할 생각은  아니었으니까.”\\n\\u3000나는 그의 표정을 정말이지 다시 보고 싶지 않았다. 그래서 그의 지금 이 말투(상대를 어려워하고 공경하는 말하기)에 대해서도 어떠한 항변도  하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000“글쎄, 나리.” 조가 얘기를 이어갔다. “이게 어떻게 된 거냐 하면. 우리가 ‘세 명의 바지선 선원들’(‘주인공 시골’의  ‘읍내  술집이름’)에 모여  있을  때였는데, 핍.”\\n\\u3000그는 애정이 북받쳐오를 때면 나를 “핍”이라고 불렀다. 그리고 거리 감이 느껴질 때면 나를 “나리”라고 불렀다.\\n그가  계속 말했다.\\n\\u3000“바로 그때 마차를 타고 펌블추크(능청스런 잡곡상인. 쌀 이외의 곡식 사고파는 도매 및 소매업자)가 다가오지 뭐냐. 언제나 그렇듯이….”\\n그가 또 엉뚱한 얘기를  꺼냈다.\\n\\u3000“그는 이따금씩 아주 지독하게도 나를 약 올리는데 말이다. 읍내 여 기저기를 돌아다니면서 ‘핍 씨가 젖먹이일 때부터 나만이 절친 이었으며, 핍 씨가 어릴 때도 나만이 유일한 놀이친구였습니다, 여러분.’이라며 온 동네방네 떠벌리고 다니지 뭐냐.”\\n\\u3000“말도 안 되는 소리 하지 말라고 그래. 날 키우고 길러준 것 조(매형 이름)잖아.”\\n\\u3000“물론 나도 그렇게 믿는다, 핍.” 조가 내 손을 가볍게 토닥이며 말했다. “하지만 세상눈들은 그렇지만도 않지 않겠습니까. 나리. 아 참, 핍이지. 이번 경우도 그래, 너와 친하다는 것이 그를(펌블추크 = 능청스러운 잡곡상. 펌블추크 씨는 조의 실제 삼촌. 혈연관계임) 어찌나 뻐기고(뽐내고) 다니게 만들었는지. (갑자기 딴 얘기를 시작함) 아, ‘파이프 담배 한 모금’과 ‘맥주 500cc(시시, 우유2개 부피) 한 잔’이 엄청 자극을 주지 않으면서도 천한 것들에게 얼마나 힘을 북돋아주는지 아셔야 합니다, 나리. (다시 원래 주제로 돌아가서 얘기함) 이번에도 그가 ‘세 명의 바지선 선원들(술집이름)’으로 나를 찾아와서는 이렇게 일갈하지 뭡니까. ‘요셉(조의 세례명)아, 미스 해비샴(무지무지한 갑부)이 너와 얘기하고  싶어 하더라.’라고요.”\\n“미스 해비샴이? 조(매형이름).” \\n\\u3000“그래 그녀가 그렇게 말했다더라. 나랑 대화를 나누고 싶다고.” 조가 앉은 자세에서 천장으로 눈동자를 굴렸다.\\n“정말, 조? 계속 말해봐, 어서.”\\n\\u3000“그래서, 나리.” 마치 내가 저 멀리 떨어져 있다는 마냥 조가 나를 아늑히 바라보며 말했다. “깨끗하게 차려입고 미스 에이를 만나러 갔습죠.”\\n“미스 뭐? 조(매형이름). 미스 해비샴(갑부)이겠지.” \\n\\u3000“제가 말한….” 자신도 그 이름을 기억해내기  위해  애쓰고  있다는 마냥 조(매형이름, 58세)가 법률적 형식의례 따위를 차려가며(늦장을 부리며) 대답했다. “미스 에이, 미스 에이가 아니라면 해비샴 말입니다, 나리. (시각사투리를 사용하며. 즉 영어단어를 발음 나는 대로 사용하며→) 그녀가 이렇게 말하더구나. (정확한 발음으로→) ‘가저리 씨 (매형의 성), 핍 씨와 편지를 주고받고 있겠지요?’라고. 그 언제냐, 그 러니까 네가 보낸 편지를 내가 분명 가지고 있으니까, 난 당연히 ‘네’  라고 대답해드렸지. 사실 내가 네 누나와 결혼할 때 난 ‘그럼요.’라고 대답했단다, 이번에 네 친구(미스 해비샴)에게 대답할 적엔 ‘네’라고 대답했고, 핍. 그녀가 계속 말했지. ‘그럼 핍에게 전해주시겠어요? 에 스텔라가 집으로 돌아왔는데 그를 만나면 기뻐할 거라고요.’” (에스텔 라는 몇 년 전에 상류층 사교계교육을 받기 위해 파리로 건너갔다가 이번에  귀국한 것임)\\n조를 보고 있는 동안 내 얼굴이 화끈 달아오르는 것을 느꼈다.\\n\\u3000내 얼굴이 달아오른 여러 원인들 중 하나는 원하건대 ‘만약 조가 에 스텔라의 도착소식을 알려주기 위해 나를 찾아온 것임을 내가 미리 알았다면, 내가 그를 훨씬 더 격려해주었을 것’이라는 어떤 자각(의식)이 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“비디는.” 조가 계속해서 말을 이어갔다. “내가 집으로 돌아와 이 소식을 전해줄 수 있겠끔 네게 편지 한 장을 써달라고 부탁하자, 약간 망설이더구나. 그리곤 이렇게 말했어. ‘직접 만나 이 소식을 전해주면  핍이 더 기뻐할 거 같아요. 마침 휴가철이고, 조도 핍을 만나고 싶어 하잖아요, 어서요, 조!’라고. 그래서 나도 용기를 내서 이렇게…, 그렇게 된 거랍니다,  나리.”\\n조가 의자에서 천천히 일어서면  말했다.\\n\\u3000“그럼 지금처럼 잘 지내고 더 많이 더 높은 데까지 오르는 훌륭한 사람이  되길  바란다, 핍.”\\n“지금 가려는 건 아니겠지,  조?”\\n“지금 가는 게 좋겠다, 핍.” 조가 말했다. “그럼 저녁식사 때까진 올 거지, 조?” “아니다, 핍.” 조가  말했다.\\n\\u3000우리의 눈이 마주쳤다. 그가 손을 내게 내밀면서 그의 씩씩한 가슴에서부터 “나리”라는 지난 어색 함들이 녹아 없어졌다.\\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000(아래는 조(주인공의 매형)의 긴 대사임. 좀 길죠~ 모두 하나의 단락이지만 임의로 폰으로 보는 분들도 많기 때문에 임의로  단락을 나누었습니다.)\\n\\n\\u3000“핍, 이 친구야, 인생은 수많은 이별들의 용접(모음)들로 구성되어 있단다. 내가 말했다시피, 어떤 사람은 대장장이의 삶을 살고, 어떤 사람은 양철공(얇은 철판으로 물건을 만드는 사람)으로 살게 된다, 그리고 어떤 사람은 금세공인(금으로 물건 만드는 사람)으로 살고, 또 어떤 사람은 구리 세공인(구리로 물건 만드는 사람)으로 산다.\\n\\u3000사람들 사이의 이런 구분은 자연스레 생기게 마련이고 그럼 생기는  대로 각자가 받아들이면 되는 거란다. 만약 오늘 내 행동에서 잘못된  점이 조금이라도 있었다면, 그건 모두 내 탓인 이유다.\\n\\u3000너와 난 런던에서 함께 해선 안 되는 두 사람(신분)이었다. 개인적이고 친밀하고 또 친한 친구들끼리의 모임이 아닌 어떤 다른 장소에서도 너와 난 함께 해선 안 되는 두 사람(신분)이다.\\n\\u3000너는 이제 이런 옷차림(인간내면의 본질이 아닌 겉꾸밈)을 한 나를  더 이상 만나지 못할 거다. 그건 내가 뻐기고 싶기  때문이  아니란다,  단지 내가 올바르고 싶기 때문이지. 내겐 이러한 옷차림들(꾸밈)이 어울리지 않아.\\n\\u3000나(대장장이, 58세)는 대장간과 우리 집 부엌을 벗어나서는 당당해질 수 없는 사람이다. 그건 우리 마을 뒤편에 있는 습지대를 벗어나선 내가 힘이 나지 않는 이유다.\\n\\u3000생각해봐라. 만약 내가  해머를 손에 쥐고 다른 손엔 파이프 담배를  들고 대장장이 옷을 차려입고 네 앞에 서 있다면 네가 오늘처럼 많은 잘못을 내게서 찾을 수  있었겠니.\\n\\u3000그래도 만약 네가 언제든 나를 다시  만나야겠다면,  대장간  창가로 와서 대장장이 일을 하고 있는 이 조(매형이름)라는 사람을 찾아라, 오래된 모루(대장간에서 금속을 올려놓는 쇠 받침대)에 서서 불에 그슬린 앞치마(작업복)를 입은 채 변함없이 내 직업에 충실하고 있는 조라는 한 인물을 만나게 될 것이다. 그에게선 오늘과 같은 어색함의 반푼어치 어색함도 찾아볼 수 없을 게다.\\n\\u3000난 어릴 적부터 지독하게 어리석었다. 또 그렇게 평생 살아왔다. 하지만 마침내는 이 문제의 시시비비(옳고 그름을)를 내 나름은 거의 밝혀냈다고 본다.\\n\\u3000주님의 은총이 있기를,

쓰다듬어 주더니 밖으로 나갔다.\\n\\u3000내가 충분히 정신을 차렸을 때, 나는 허겁지겁 그를 뒤쫓아 거리로 뛰쳐나갔고, 거리와 거리 사이를 뛰어다니며 그를 찾았지만 어디에도 그는  보이지 않았다.\\n\\n\\n\\n위대한 유산\\n28장\\n\\n\\n이튿날(다음날)에 내가 고향으로 내려가야된다는 사실은 명백했다. 뉘우침의 첫 번째 밀물과 함께,

위조지폐를 내가 순진하게 받을 수는 있다. 그건 충분히 타당한 일이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 내가 직접 만든 가짜지폐를 진짜지폐라며 고의적으로 자신하는 것도 충분히 합리적인  일인가!\\n\\u3000‘어떤 친절한 낯선 사람’이 도난방지를 위해 내 지폐를 단단히 접어서 보관해주겠다는 핑계를 대며 내 지폐를 빼앗은 후 대신 내게는 호두  껍데기를

엄청 헤매고 있었다.\\n\\u3000저런 돈 먹는 하마 녀석이 여인숙 건물 출입구 아치 아래에 서서 남들이 다 보는 앞에서 자기 부츠에 바람을 쐬고 있는 모습이 사람들에게 줄 감명을 생각하는 것은 너무나도 유혹적인 일이었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그리고 우연인 듯 가장해가며 저 녀석을 신사복가게에 보여줌으로써 ‘트랩(돈 많이 버는 재봉사노총각) 가게

‘치프사이드 시티’의 ‘우드 거리’를 말함)를 출발하는 시각이  2시였다.\\n\\u3000나는 내 보디가드 녀석(심부름꾼 소년)의 시중을 받으며 15분의  여유를 두고 ‘크로스 키즈’에 도착했다.\\n\\u3000만약 내가 ‘보디가드’란 표현을 ‘만약 내 신변을 돌볼지 말지를 결정할 수 있다면 절대 나를 돕지 않을 저 녀석’과 연결시킬 수 있다면 말이다.\\n\\u3000역마차(승합마차)에 재소자(죄수)들을 태우고서 해군조선소(배 공장)까지 내려가는 것은 당시까지만 해도 하나의 관례였다.\\n\\u3000열외의 승객자격으로 마차에 오른다는 재소자들에 대한 얘기는 나도 들어 알고 있었다. 그리고 주요도로에서 ‘대형  4륜  마차(바퀴4개)’의 지붕 위로 쇠 족쇄(다리수갑)를 대롱거리는 그들을 몇 번이고 보았기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000마차 역 구내(지방에서 런던으로 올 때 반드시 들르는 곳임)에서 나를 발견한 허버트(절친, 25세)가 내게로 다가와 “네가 예약한 마차로 이송될 재소자들이 두 명이나 있데.”라고 했을 때 내가 놀랄 이유는 하나도 없었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 내가 “재소자”라는 단어를 들을 때마다 체질적으로 불안정해지는 이유는 있었다. 그것은 지금 아주  오래된 이유였다.(주인공은  어린 시절에 탈옥수(죄수)에게 빵과 포도주를 몰래 건네준 적이 있는데 널 불안해했음. 그 빵과 포도주가 누나 몰래 부엌에서 훔친 거라서)\\n“괜찮겠니? 헨델(주인공의 애칭).” 허버트(주인공의 절친)가 말했다. “오, 그럼!”\\n“아니 난 그냥, 네가 별로 달가워하지 않을 것 같아서.”\\n\\u3000“그렇다고 내가 그들을 좋아한다고 말할 순 없잖니, 너도 뭐 그들이 별로인거 같은데, 하지만 나야 꺼릴 것이 없지.”\\n\\u3000“저길 봐! 그들이 술집에서 나오고 있어.” 허버트가 말했다. “어쩜 저렇게도 타락하고 비열한 몰골들을 하고 있을까?”\\n\\u3000죄수들이 자신들의 교도관에게 한 턱 내고 있었던 것 같았다.  왜냐하면 교도관 한 명이 그들과 함께 보였기 때문이다. 세 명 모두 두 손  으로 입들을 닦으며 술집에서 나오고 있었다.\\n\\u30002명의 죄수들은 함께 수갑이  채워져  있었다. 쇠 족쇄(다리수갑)는 각각 따로 채워져 있었다. 내가 잘 알고 있는 형태의 바로 그 쇠 족쇄였다.(어릴 적에 주인공이 매형의 대장간에서 쇠줄을 훔쳐다가 탈옥수에게 건네주었고 탈옥수가 그 쇠줄로 족쇄를 갈고 있는 모습에 겁이 나 도망친 적이 있는데, 한동안 극한 공포에 시달렸었음)\\n그들은  또한  내가  익히  잘  알고  있는  죄수복들을  입고  있었다. 그들의 감시자(교도관)는 양쪽 허리에 권총 한 자루씩 차고 있었다.\\n그는 또한 겨드랑이에 ‘끝에 굵은 혹이 있는 몽둥이’를 끼고 있었다. 하지만 그 감시자는 죄수들과 친밀한 관계를 유지하고 있는 사이 같았다. 그가 자기 옆에 죄수들을 서 있게 했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그 교도관은 다소 점잔빼며 자신만만한 태도로 마차에 말을 메는 장면을 구경하고 있었다. 마치 죄수들이 지금으로서는 아직 정식 오픈되지 않은 흥미 있는 전시물인양 그리고 자신은 그 전시물의 큐레이터 (전시책임자)인  양 말이다.\\n\\u3000두 명의 죄수들 중, 한 명은 키가 더 커고 더 굳세(튼튼해) 보였다. 죄수의 세계와 일반인의 세계모두에서 비밀로 하는 풍습에 의거해, 너무나 당연하게도, 키가 큰 죄수는 키가 작은 죄수보다 더 작은 치수의 옷들을 할당받은 것  같았다.\\n\\u3000그의 두 팔과 두 다리는 마치 바늘을 꽂아 놓은 헝겊 같았다. 그의 의상(죄수복)이 그를 우스꽝스럽게 숨기주고  있었다.\\n하지만 나는 그 자의 반쯤 감긴 눈을 한눈에 알아보았다.\\n\\u3000어느 토요일 밤에(주인공이 어릴 적에) ‘세 명의 쾌활한 바지선 선원 들(주인공 시골의 술집이름)’에 앉아서 한 쪽 눈을 지그시 감은 채 꼭 보이지 않는 총구멍으로 나를 “탕!”하고 겨누었던 그 자가 저기에 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000다만 그가 나를 평생 본 적이 절대 없었다는 듯이, 아직까진 나를 알아보지 못한다는 것을 확인하기는  쉬웠다.\\n\\u3000그때 그가 나를 대충 훑어보았다, 그러더니 내 회중시계(호주머니에 넣는 비싼 시계)의 쇠줄이 얼마 나갈까를 생각하는 듯 한 눈빛을 보이더니 땅바닥에 침을 “탁!”하고 뱉더니 옆에 있던 다른 죄수에게 뭐라고 중얼거렸다. 그러더니 뭐가 그렇게 좋은지 자기들끼리 “껄껄!”거리며 웃었다.\\n\\u3000곧 두 죄수가 두 사람을 커플로 묶고 있던 수갑을 서로 부딪쳐 쨍그랑 소리를 내면서 뒤로 돌아섰다. 그런 후 다른 것에 정신이  팔려 나는  잊고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그들의 등 뒤에는 거리에 면한 주택의 현관문처럼 아주 큰 번호가 그려져 있었다. 그들은 거칠고 털이 빠져  보기  흉한 피부를  하고 있었 고, 그건 마치 그들을 저급한 하등동물로 보이게끔 만들고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그들의 두 다리에는 마치 사과(미안)라도 하려는  듯이  손수건들을 모아 둥글게 고리 모양을 낸 쇠 족쇄들이 채워져 있었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 마차 역 구내에 있던 모든 사람들이 그들(죄수들)을 멀리하면서 그들을 쳐다보고 있는 방식, 앞서 말한 이 모든 이유들이 이 죄 수들을, 허버트(주인공의 절친)가 말했듯이, 극도로 불쾌하고 타락한 강등당한 모습으로 보이게끔 하고  있었다.\\n아, 설상가상(불행이 겹침)이란 말은 이럴 때 쓰는 말일까.\\n\\u3000런던에서 이사를 떠나는 한 가족이 마차 뒷좌석 전체를 차지해버리는 바람에, (룰루랄라...-_-), 두 죄수가 앉을 자리가 없어져 버린 것이다. 그래서 마부 바로 뒤 첫 번째 줄의 좌석에 죄수들이 앉게 되었다.\\n\\u3000이 결과로서, 원래 그 자리에 앉기로 되어 있던, 아주 화를 잘 내는 영국신사 한 분이 갑자기 격렬한 분노를 내뿜으시며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“영국신사를 저런 극악무도한 것들과 합석 시키는  것은  계약위반이오. 이것은 유해하고 파멸적이고 수치스러운 망신살이오. 그래 망신살 나는 이 이상 더 어울리는 말을 생각해낼 수 없소.”\\n\\u3000이때는 대형 사륜마차(바퀴 4개)가 이미 출발준비를 마쳤고, 마부도 안달이 난 상태였고, 승객들도 마차에 오를 준비를 마친 상태라, 문제의 그 죄수2명도 교도관과 함께 등장했는데 죄수들의 등장과 함께 기  이한 냄새, 즉 끓는 물에 적신 빵으로 만든 찜질약 같은 냄새, 베이즈 (당구대 녹색 모직 천 냄새) 냄새, 밧줄 만드는 가는 줄 냄새, 그리고 광내는 돌 냄새가 났는데, 이것들은 죄수들이 있는 곳이면 항상 생기는  기이한 냄새였다.\\n\\u3000“너무 그렇게만 탓하진 말아주십시오, 나리.” 교도관이 화를  내고 있는  신사에게 애원했다.\\n\\u3000“당신 옆엔 제가 앉고, 저것들은 좌석 바깥쪽에 앉히면 되지 않겠습니까. 저것들 때문에 절대로 나리의 여행길이 방해받는 일은 없을 겁 니다요. 저런 것들일랑은 그냥 있어도 없는 척해주십시오, 나리.”\\n\\u3000“날 탓하진 마쇼.” 내가 익히 얼굴을  알고 있는 죄수가 으르렁거리며 말했다. “이런 제길, 이건 뭐 내가 좋아 가는 길인감. 가래도 가기 싫구먼. 어느 누가 나대신 가든 나로서는 대환영이니까.”\\n\\u3000“아니면 내 대신 가든지. 낄낄.” 다른 죄수가 퉁명스럽게 말했다. “당신네들 누구한테도 폐 끼칠 생각일랑은 없소, 난 내 길만 가면 되니까, 푸헤헤.”\\n\\u3000두 죄수가 동시에  웃었다. 그리고  두 죄수가  호두를 깨물어 부수더니 여기저기에 호두 껍데기들을 뱉어 댔다.\\n\\u3000만약 내가 그들 입장에서 그런 식으로 경멸을 당했다면, 내 자신도 저렇게 행동하지 않았을까 싶었다.\\n\\u3000결국, 화를 내던 신사를 도울 길은 하나도 없었다. 그는 이제 죄수와 동행을 하든지, 아니면 역에 계속 남아 있든지 양자택일해야만 했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 여전히 투덜대며 신사가 마차에 올랐다. 다음으로 교도관이  올라 신사 옆 좌석에 앉았다. 그리고 죄수들도 자신들이 할 수 있는 한 잘 서로를 잡아당기며 마차에 올랐다.\\n\\u3000그런데 하필이면 내가 얼굴을 알고 있는 죄수가 내 뒷좌석에 앉아       내 머리카락 위로 숨을 내쉬고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“잘 다녀와, 헨델(주인공의 애칭)!” 마차가 출발하려하자 허버트(주인공의  절친)가 소리쳤다.\\n\\u3000그가 나에게 핍(주인공의  실명)이라는 이름 대신 애칭(별명)을  만들어 주었었던 것이 ‘얼마나 축복 받을 일인가!’하고 나는 생각했다.\\n\\u3000나는 그 죄수의 호흡을 내 뒷머리로만 느낀 것이 아니었다. 그가 한 번 숨을 쉴 때마다 내 등뼈를 따라 내가 얼마나 격심하게 느끼고 있었는지 이 자리에서 설명하기는 어려울 정도다.\\n\\u3000그 느낌은, 어떤 찌르듯이 자극적이고 모진(날카로운) 산(산성)이 골수(뼈 안에 있는 신경세포 덩어리. 노란색으로 보임)에 닿은 것 같이 나를 불편하게 하는 느낌이었다.\\n\\u3000그는 다른 사람보다 더 많이 숨 쉬는 일을 하려는  것 같았고, 그는  숨을 쉴 때에도 다른 사람보다 더 요란하게 호흡하려는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000내가 어깨를 오그리며 그의 숨길을  피하려다보니, 나는 내 한쪽 어깨가 높이 들어 올려지는 것을 의식하였다.\\n날씨는 비참하고 몹시 추웠다. 두 죄수는 추위를  저주했다.\\n\\u3000추위 때문에 마차가 멀리 가기도 전에 우리 모두는 감각이 무뎌졌다. 중간 기착지(휴게소 역)를 벗어났을 때(떠났을 때) 우리는 습관적으로 꾸벅꾸벅 졸거나 와들와들 떨며 조용했다.\\n\\u3000헤어지기 전에 이 죄수에게, 그가 예전에 내게 주었던 50만 원짜리  수표 두 장을 되돌려주어야 할지 말지 그리고 어떻게 하면 그 일을 어색하지 않게 잘 해낼 수 있을지 하는 문제를 생각하다가 나도 모르게  잠이 들었다.\\n\\u3000마치 말들 사이로 다이빙을 한 것처럼 좌석 앞쪽으로 굴러 떨어질뻔 했을 때, 나는 깜짝 놀라서 깼다. 그리곤 다시 그 문제를 되씹어보기 시작했다.\\n그 후, 나는  내가  생각한  것보다  더  오래  잠들었음이  분명했다. 하지만, 내가 비록 어둠속에서 아무 것도 알아볼 수 없었고 램프의\\n빛과 그늘의 깜빡임 사이에서 아무것도 알아볼 수 없었을지라도, 우리 마차를 향해 부는 춥고 축축한 바람 속에서 우리 고장 늪지대의 자취를 나는 느낄 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000온기를 위해 그리고 거센 바람을 나를 방패로 해서 막으려고 앞쪽으로 웅크렸기 때문에 두 죄수는 마차를 탔을 때보다 내게 더 접근해 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 어느 정도 잠에서 깨어났을 때, 그들 사이에 오고가는 대화에서 내가 알아들은 첫 번째 말이 “50만 원짜리 수표 2장.”이었다. 그것은 내가 지금까지 고민해오던 바로 그 말이었다.\\n“그는 그 수표들을 어떻게 구했대?” 다른 죄수가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“낸들 아나?” 내가 얼굴을 아는 죄수가 말했다. “어떻게든 숨겨놓았던 수표일 테지. 아님 친구들이 준 수표였을 수도 있고.”\\n\\u3000“제기랄.” 다른 죄수가 추위를 길길이 저주하며 말했다. “지금 당장 그게 있었으면 좋겠구먼, 이런 젠장맞을.”\\n“수표?  아님 친구들이?”\\n\\u3000“수표 말이야 수표. 50만 원짜리 수표 한 장을 위해서라면 내 친구들을 몽땅 팔 생각도 있으니까 말이야. 아 그렇게만 되면 이 얼마나 축복받을 흥정일까, 그래 그 자식이 뭐라고 그러던?”\\n내가 얼굴을 아는 죄수가 지난 시간을 되씹으며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“조선소 목재 더비 뒤였을 거야. 거기서 극히 짧은 시간에 이 모든 게 이루어졌지. 그자가 이러더군. ‘조만간 나간다며?’ 내가 그렇다고 말했지. 그러자 나보고 어떤 꼬마 녀석 하나를 찾아 달래. 그 꼬마가 자기에게 먹을 것을 주고 비밀을 지켜줬다나, 그러면서 그 수표 2장을    꼭 그 꼬마 녀석에게 전달해주지 않겠나? 라더군. 그래서 그러마라고  내가 말했지. 석방 된 후 난 그 자의 부탁대로 꼬마를 찾아가 수표를 건네주었다네.  그게 다야.”\\n\\u3000“자네도 바보로군.” 다른 죄수가 화난  목소리로 말했다. “카~, 나라면 그 수표들을 먹고 마시는데 다 써버렸을 텐데. 그리고 그 자도 풋내기였음이 틀림없어. 내 말인즉슨, 그 자가 자넬 전혀 몰랐다고 하지 않았나?”\\n\\u3000“전혀 모르는 사이였지. 서로 다른 조였고, 서로 다른 배에 있었으니까. 그자는 재차 탈옥을 시도했고 결국 붙잡혀 무기징역형(당시 영국의 무기 징역은 ‘오스트레일리아로의 추방’을 의미)을 선고받았지.”\\n\\u3000“빙고! 그러니까 그자를 만났던 시기가 자네가 이 지방에서 노역을  하던 유일한 시기였다  이거지?”\\n“딱  한 번이지.”\\n“그래 이 염병할 지역에 대한 자네의 고견은 어떤가?”\\n\\u3000“짐승 같이 잔인하고 더러운 동네야. 온 사방이 ‘진흙 사주(퇴적지 형)’고, 온통  안개고, 온통  눅눅하고,  욕지거리를 하며 일만  했지, 또  그 다음날 일어나선 욕을 내뱉고 일하고, 습지에 발이 빠지고 주위는  온통 그 망할 놈의 ‘진흙 사주’뿐이고.”\\n\\u3000두 죄수 모두 온갖 악담을  퍼부으며 그 고장(주인공의  마을 인근 해변가 노역장)을 저주했다. 그러다 점점  악담의  수위가  낮아지더니 결국 아무 말도 하지  않았다.\\n\\u3000이들의 대화를 우연히 들은 후, 나는 분명 일어나 마찻길 어둠 속을 방패삼아 외롭게 몸을 숨겼어야 했었다. 하지만 그 죄수가 내 신원을 의심하지 않는다는 확신이 서서 그러지 못했다.\\n\\u3000그러고 보니, 그동안 나도 나이(현재나이가 19세 또는 23세 둘 중에 하나임)를 많이 먹었을 뿐만 아니라, 그때 당시와 비교해 입고 있는 옷이며 경제적인 처지가 판이하게 달라 있었기 때문에, 돌발적 변수가 발생하지 않는 한 그 죄수가 나를 알아보는 일은 있을 법하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000하지만  하고 많은 마차들 중에  내가 탄  대형 4륜 마차(바퀴 4개)에   그 죄수가 올라탔다는 이 하나의 우연이 나를 몹시도 괴롭히고 있었다. 그런 우연성의 연장선에서 또 다른 우연이 발생해 그가  내 이름을 나와 연결시킬 수 있는 어떤 계기가 막 생길 것만 같은 이상한 생각에 나는  온통 사로잡혀버렸다.\\n\\u3000이런 이유 때문에, 나는 마차가 마을에 닿자마자 내려서 그가 내 소식을 듣지 못할 정도로까지 멀리 가버리기로 결심했다.\\n나는 이 방법을 성공적으로 실행했다.\\n\\u3000내 작은 여행 가방은 ‘내 발 아래에 있는 트렁크(짐 넣는 곳)’에 있었기 때문에, 난 단지 경첩을 돌려 내 여행 가방을 꺼내기만 하면 되었다.\\n\\u3000내가 여행 가방을 먼저 마차 밖으로 내던졌다. 그런 다음 나도 마차에서 내렸다. 그렇게 해서 나는 읍내(주인공의 마을에서 가장 가까운 읍내) 포장도로의 첫 번째 비석 위에 있는 첫 번째 램프  아래에 남겨  지게 되었다.\\n\\u3000그 두 죄수에 대해 말하자면, 그들은 대형 4륜 마차(바퀴4개)에 그대로 남아 자신들의 길을 갔다. 나는 그 죄수들이 강 어느 지점으로 비밀리에 끌려갈지 잘  알았다.\\n\\u3000나는 “상상 속으로” ‘더럽고 끈적끈적한 물질들에 절은 선착장 계단’에서 두 죄수의 도착을 기다리고 있는 승무원죄수들과 보트를 보았다.\\n\\u3000보트에 탄 누군가가 마치 개들에게 으르렁거리듯 승무원죄수들에게  “이 새끼들아, 기브웨이다(노 저어)!”라며 소리치던 목소리가 다시 한  번 들리는 것만 같았다.(‘기브웨이’ 노들을 수면에 적시라는 신호임. 출발 시 처음 한두 번 서서히 노를 젓는 일. 5장 참조)\\n\\u3000내 눈에는 검은 바다 위에 음침하게 멈춰서 있던 그때 그 감옥선,  사악한 노아의 방주 같이만 느껴졌었던 그 감옥 선이 다시 보이는 것만 같았다. (주인공은 어릴 적에 군인들이 탈옥수를 생포하는 모습과  그 탈옥수가 감옥 선으로 끌려가는 장면을 목격하고 깊은 인상을 받은 적이 있음. 5장 참조)\\n\\u3000(어릴 적에는 단순히 목격하는 것으로 끝이 났지만 이젠 그렇게 호락호락 끝나지만은 않을 거라는 암시임. 여자라는 새로운 변수가 생기기 때문입니다. 물론 돈도 주인공을 망치는 데 한 몫 하겠지만….)\\n\\u3000내가 무엇을 그리도 두려워했었는지 차마 여기서 밝힐 순 없다. 왜 냐하면 내 두려움은 불분명함과 모호함의 혼합물이었기 때문이다. 하지만 그것은 거의 목전까지(가까이까지) 닫쳤던 두려움이었다.\\n\\u3000호텔까지 걸어가면서 나는, 단지 고통스럽고 불유쾌한 알아봄에  대한 불안에의 감정을 훨씬 초월하는 공포에 전율하고 말았다.\\n\\u3000나는 확신한다. 나는 그 공포가 뚜렷한 형태가 없다는 것과 그것이  단지 내 어린 시절의 공포에 대한 몇 분 동안의 되새김질이었음을 인정한다. (앞뒤 설명 : 주인공이 어린 시절에 탈옥수에게  빵과 포도주를 훔쳐서 건네준 이유는, 탈옥수가 자신에게 음식을 가져 다주지 않으면 자신의 젊은 친구가 어린 주인공의 생간을 먹을 거라고 위협했기 때문인데, 주인공은 상당한 기간 동안 두려움에 떨었음. 그때 일이 잠시 생각났다는  얘기임.)\\n\\u3000‘외설적인 수퇘지’(주인공 시골 읍내의 술집이름이자 여인숙이름)에 딸린 다방엔 손님이 아무도 없었다. 내가 다방에서 내 저녁식사를 주문하고 자리에 앉을 때까지 웨이터는 내 얼굴을 알아보지 못했다.\\n곧 그가 나를  알아봤다.\\n\\u3000“신사 분께서는 저의 부주의한 기억력을 용서해주시겠지요?” 그러더니 “펌블추크 씨(67세, ‘주인공 매형’의 친삼촌. 주인공과는 전혀 혈연 관계가 아님)에게 알려야겠지요?”라며 심부름꾼을 보내도 되는지를 내게 물었다.\\n“아뇨.” 내가 말했다. “됐습니다.  됐어요.”\\n\\u3000내 대답에 웨이터는 적잖이 당황한  표정이었다. 사실 그는 내가 어릴 때 그 망할 놈의 대장장이 수습공 계약서에 싸인 하던 날, 외판원 (세일즈맨)들의 강력한 불평을 판사에게 성토하던 자인데….\\n\\u3000하지만 그는 곧 내 앞에 먼지 가득하고 오래된 지방일간지 한 부를 가져다 놓는 센스를 발휘함으로써 앞서의 어색함을 만회할 기회를 조기에 가졌다.\\n나는 신문을 집어 들고 다음과 같은 단락을 읽기 시작했다. \\n\\n\\u3000(아래 내용은 주인공 고향의 지방일간지에 실린 칼럼(논평)내용입니다.)\\n\\n\\u3000오호~ 독자들이 전적으로 흥미를 가지지 아니할 수 없는 것이 아니한(-_-;;), 즉 이 지방 제철업에 종사하던 한(어느) 젊은 기술공(주인공)에게 최근에 일어난 드라마틱한 신분상승에  관한,  뭐  어쨌거나,  오~ 이 주제가, 피치 못하지 아니한 것이 아닐 사유로 아직까지는 널리 알려지지 못한 우리 읍내 사람인, 투비(사람이름, 한 번만 등장하는 이름임, 알 필요 없음) 즉 우리 칼럼(논평)의 시인이 마술적인 필력을 펼치기에 참말로 좋은 주제가 아니하지 아니한 것이 아니올시다.\\n\\u3000그 청년의 아기 때부터의 후원자이자 동료요 친구는 이제 널리 평판이 자자한 한 인물인데, 물론 그 분은 ‘곡물 장사나 씨앗 장사(펌블추크 씨의 직업)’과 완전히 관련이 없지 아니한 것이 아닌 인물이올시다,   그 분의 두드러지게 편리하고 넓은 상점은 시내중심가(거리)에서 고작 160킬로미터(어른이 걸어서 4일. 마차로는 쉬지 않고 가야 10시간)밖에 안 떨어져 있는 위치에 있어올시다.\\n\\u3000그 분은, 우리가 그(펌블추크 씨. 능청스러운 상인임)를 오디세우스 (영웅)가 자신의 아들인 텔레마코스(사람이름, 처음에는 미약한 존재였다가 불운과 행운을 경험하며 성장해가는 인물)의 교육을 맡긴 멘토르 (사람이름, 모두 그리스 신화) 같은 인물이었다고 수첩에 기록하고픈 우리네의 감정들과 완전히 관계가 없는 것이 아니한 것이 아니한데.\\n\\u3000이유인즉슨 우리 지방이, 텔레마코스(주인공을 의미함)가 누린 행운 들의 창설자를 배출할 수 있었다는 사실이 그지없는 기쁨이기 때문이 올시다.\\n\\u3000아, “누가 그 행운들의 주인공이냐?”라고 지방 현자의 찌푸린 이마     가  심사숙고하며 묻는가요?\\n\\u3000아니면, “누가 그 행운들의 주인공이에요?”라고 이 지방 미인의 초롱초롱한 두 눈이 묻는단  말인가?\\n그렇다면 우리는 이렇게만  말하겠다.\\n\\u3000“쿠엔틴 마세이스(16세기 벨기에 화가. 대장장이 출신임. 고리대금업자가 금화 세고 있는데 옆에서 아내가 성경을 손에 쥐고 있는 그림을   그린 사람)도 처음엔 앤트워프(벨기에의 항구 도시)의 말발굽을 다루던 대장장이였었다.”라고.\\n현자에게는 이 한 마디면 충분하리라. \\n“대.  장.  장. 이”\\n\\n(여기까지가 주인공이 밥 먹다 말고 읽은 신문칼럼(논평) 끝입니다.) \\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000지대한 내 지난 경험들에 비추어보건대, 용의자(이런 엉뚱한 칼럼을 지방일간지에 보낸 ‘투비’라는 인물이 실은 ‘펌블추크 씨’일거라는 확신)는 분명했다.\\n\\u3000만약 내 번영의 시기(일간지 칼럼을 읽었던 그때)에 북극으로 갔었어도, 나는 그곳에서 “펌블추크 씨(능청스런 잡곡상인)가 당신의 후원자이자 행운의 설계자라면서요?

 올릭.”\\n\\u3000“내 발로 왔지.” 그가 삐딱하게 말했다. “손수레에 한 상자 실고서 여기로 왔지.”\\n“그럼 여기서 영원히 사실  건가요?”\\n“나쁜 짓 하려고 여기 있는 건 아니겠지요, 도련님.” 나는 그의 말을 믿을 수가 없었다.\\n\\u3000그가 자신의 무거운 눈을 바닥에서부터 천천히 들어올려 내 다리, 팔, 그리고 내 얼굴을 보고 있는 동안, 나는 마음속으로 그의 말대꾸를 차분히 되새겨보았다.\\n“그럼 대장간 일은 그만 두었단 말인가요?” 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이 옷이 대장간에서 일하는 사람 옷같이 보이냐?” 올릭이 험악한 시선으로 자기 주위 여기저기로 시선을 보내더니 말했다. “자, 이래도 대장간에서 일하는 옷처럼  보여?”\\n\\u3000나는 “가저리 씨(주인공 매형의 이름)의 대장간을 떠난지 얼마나 되셨죠?”라고 물어보았다.\\n\\u3000“여기선 하루하루가 다 비슷해, 따로 더해보지 않고선 모르겠는데. 하지만 네가 런던으로 떠난 후 머지않아 여기로 왔지.”\\n“그걸 몰라서 묻는 게  아니잖아요!”\\n\\u3000“흥!” 그가 무미건조하게 말했다. “이젠 모르는 게 없는 학자가 되셨구먼, 제길.”\\n\\u3000우리는 이때 저택에 도착해 있었다. 그곳에서 나는 그의 방이  저택  옆문 바로 내부에 있는 방이며, 그 방문엔 안뜰을 구경할 수  있는 작은 창문이 달려있다는 사실을  알았다.\\n\\u3000방의 크기는 작았다. 파리에 있는 어느 문지기들에게 일반적으로 할당되는 방과 크게 다르지 않는 방이었다.\\n\\u3000몇몇 열쇠들이 방안 벽에 걸려 있었고, 그가 이제 막 벽에다 정문 열쇠를  추가로 걸었다.\\n\\u3000각양각색의 헝겊들로 잇대어 덮여있는, 그의 침대는 방 안쪽으로 쑥 들어가 구획되어 있는 작은 곳에 있었다.\\n\\u3000전체적으로 되는대로 처박혀 있고 좁고 졸리는 듯한 모습을 하고 있는 방이었다. 마치 인간 겨울잠 쥐(잠자기 좋아하는 사람)의 아지트 같았다.\\n\\u3000창문 옆 모퉁이의  그늘 속에서 어렴풋하게 보이는 검고 묵직한  ‘그의 모습은’ 흡사 이 방에 꼭 맞는 ‘인간 겨울잠 쥐 같았다.’\\n사실대로 말하자면 그는 인간 겨울 잠 쥐 그 자체였다. \\n\\u3000“전에는 못 보든 방인데.” 내가 논평했다. “그렇지 그땐 여기에 문지 기란  없을 때니까.”\\n\\u3000“그래.” 올릭(사악한 악당, 현재는 문지기)이 말했다. “하지만 이 큰 부지를 지켜줄 수단이 하나도 없다는 것이 알려지면서 이 곳이 아주 위험해졌지, 죄수들이며 어중이떠중이이며 거지들이며 하층민들이 오르락내리락 했으니까. 그런 다음 당한 만큼 되갚아주는 사나이로써 내가 문지기로 추천되었지. 난 당연히 그 일을 맡았고. 이건 뭐 풀무질 (대장간에서 불을 피울 때 바람을 일으키는  일)이나  해머(망치)질보다  도 더 편해. (주인공의 시선이 벽에 걸린 총에 모이는 것을 알고) 저거 장전된  거야, 진짜야.”\\n그것은 내 시선을 뒤쫓던 그가 한 말이었다.\\n\\u3000내 시선은 정말로 벽난로 위 선반 위 ‘테두리가 놋쇠(=구리+아연)로 보강된 총 한 자루’에 고정되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000 “그럼.” 그(올릭, 사악한 악당)와 더 대화를 나누기 싫어서 내가 다짜고짜, “미스 해비샴 마님을 만나러 올라가 봐도 되죠?”라고 물었다.\\n\\u3000“그걸 알면 내가 사람이 아니지.” 그가 우선 스트레칭을 쭉 해보이더니 몸을 이리저리 흔들면서 비딱하게 말했다. “내가 받은 지시는 여기까지요, 도련님. 여기에 놓인 이 망치로  내가  벨을  쾅  두드릴  테니 까, 그럼 넌 아무나 만날 때까지 혼자 쭉 통로를 올라가면 돼.”\\n“마님도 제가 온 거  아시죠?”\\n“젠장 할 내가 그걸 알 면 두 번 타 죽겠다!” 그가 말했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 나는 곧 내가 두꺼운 장화를 신고서 어릴 적에 처음으로 밟았었던 이 기나긴 통로로 접어들었다. 역시 그(올릭)가 벨을 망치로 두 드려  소리를 만들었다.\\n통로의 끝자락에서도 벨이 여전히 울려 퍼지고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 통로의 끝에서 세라 포킷(결혼하지 않은 주름투성이 노파. 소설 속에서 주인공의 신분에 중요한 변화가 있을 때마다 현실의 문을 열어주는 역할을 하는 엑스트라. 독자가 이름을 알아두면 중간 중간 소설의 흐름을 이해하는데 도움이 많이 됨, 다만 몇 번 안  나오는 이름이라 기억하기가 쉽지 않은 게 흠~)을 발견했다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 지금 내 갑작스런 등장 때문에 얼굴이  녹색이나  황색(노란 색)이 되는 체질이 된 것 같이 보였다.\\n“오!” 세라 포킷이 말했다. “당신, 그쵸?, 당신 핍 씨군요?”\\n\\u3000“예, 미스 포킷 양(미스). 포킷 씨와 그 가족들(주인공의절친인 허버트의 가족)이 잘 지내고 있더라는 얘기를 들려드리게 되어 기쁩니다.”\\n\\u3000“그들이 눈치가 좀 빨라졌나요?” 세라가 우울한 표정으로 고개를 가 로저으며 말했다. “그들은 잘 지내는 것보단 좀 더 현명해질 필요가 있어요. 아, 고지식한 매튜(허버트의 아버지), 고지식한 매튜! 길은 아 시죠, 나리?”\\n\\u3000어둠 속에서 몇 번이고 오르곤 했었던 계단이라 웬만큼 알고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 어릴 적에 여기 처음 와서 이 계단을 오를 때보다, 지금 훨씬 더 가벼운 부츠를 신고 나는 이 계단을 올랐다. 이 익숙한 길을 톡톡 두드려가다 보니 어느새 미스 해비샴의 방문 앞에 도착해있었다.\\n“핍(주인공이름)이  노크(똑똑) 드립니다.”\\n그 즉시 그녀(미스 해비샴)의 목소리가 들려왔다. “들어오거라, 핍.”\\n\\u3000그녀는 오래된 식탁 가까이에 놓인 의자에 앉아 있었다. 옷도 예전 그대로 오래된 옷이었다. 자신의 막대기(지팡이) 위에 두 손을 겹쳐놓고 있었고, 그 손 등위에서 그녀의 턱이 휴식을 취하고 있었다. 그녀의 두 눈은 지금 벽난로의 불길을 바라보고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그녀(미스 해비샴) 곁에는, 결코 누가 신어본 적이 없는 휜 색 구두를 손에 쥐고서, 고개를 숙여 그 구두를 살피고 있는, 내가 일찍이 본 적이 없는 우아한 여성이 앉아 있었다.\\n\\u3000“들어 오거라, 핍.” 미스 해비샴이 낮게 울리는 목소리로 계속 말했다. 하지만 뒤돌아본다거나 올려다본다거나 하진  않았다. “들어오거라, 핍, 그래 어떻게 지냈느냐, 핍? 마치 내가 여왕이라도 되는 것처럼 내 손에 키스를 하는구나. 응? 그렇지 않니?”\\n\\u3000그 순간 그녀가 갑자기 눈으로만 나를 쳐다보았다. 그러더니 짓궂게도 장난스런 말을  계속했다.\\n“그렇지 않니?”\\n\\u3000“저는…, 미스 해비샴 마남.” 내가 약간 당황스러워 이렇게 말했다. “친절하시게 도, 마님께서 저를 보시자고 했다는 그래서 이렇게 서둘러 왔습….”\\n“그게 다니?”\\n\\u3000내가 전에 한 번도 만난 적이 없는 그 숙녀가 고개를 들어 짓궂은 표정으로  나를 보았다.\\n그런 다음 나는 그 눈 속에서 에스텔라의 눈을 보았다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그녀는 너무나도 많이 변해있었다. 전보다 아주 훨씬 더 아름다워져 있었고, 전보다 아주 훨씬 더 여성스러워져 있었다. 모든 면에서 감탄을 자아내고 있었으며, 그녀의 그러한 변화는 너무나 놀라운 발전이라 내가 그동안 이룬 변화는 그저 아무것도 아닌 듯 느껴질 정 도였다.\\n\\u3000그런 그녀를 바라보고 있자니 내가 거칠고 천한 막노동꾼 소년으로 돌아간 것 같은 절망감속이 들었다.\\n\\u3000아, 내가 맞다드린 그 거리감과 불균형의 자각이란, 그리고 그녀에게 일어난 그 접근하기  어려움이란!\\n\\u3000그녀가 나에게 손을 내밀었다. 나는 말까지 더듬어가며 그녀를 다시 만나게 된 것이 더없는 기쁨이며 오늘과 같은 기회가 오기를 그동안 오랫동안 너무도 오랫동안 학수고대해 왔노라는 등등의 얘기를 했다.\\n\\u3000“저 애가 얼마나 많이 변했는지 알아보겠니? 핍.” 미스 해비샴이 갈 망하는 눈빛으로 내게  물었다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴이 지팡이로 그녀들(미스 해비샴과 에스텔라) 사이에 놓인 의자를 두드렸다. 나보고 거기에 앉으라는 신호인 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000“미스 해비샴 마님, 제가 방으로 들어섰을 때, 얼굴이나 모습에서 전혀 에스텔라가 아닌 듯 했습니다. 하지만 지금은 너무나도 신기하게도 예전처럼 모두 제자리를  잡았….”\\n\\u3000“뭐라고? 설마 저 애가 예전 그대로라고 말하진 않을 테지?” 미스 해비샴이 내 말을 가로막으며 말했다. “저 애는 도도하고 무례했지. 넌 그런 저 애로부터 도망치고 싶어 했고. 핍, 내가 잘못 기억하고 있는 거니?”\\n\\u3000나는 당황해서 “마님, 그건 너무 오래전 일이고…, 그땐 제가 아직 잘 모를 때이고…, (횡설수설)”라고  말했다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 조금도 동요하지 않고 웃으며 말했다. 그녀도 내가 전적으로 옳았음을 확신한다고, 그리고 그녀가 그때 대단히 무례한 애였다고 말했다.\\n“그가 변했니?” 미스 해비샴이 그녀에게 물었다. \\n“아주 많이요.” 에스텔라가 나를 바라보며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“덜 거칠고 덜 저속해졌니?” 미스 해비샴이 에스텔라의 머리카락을 만지작거리며 말했다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 웃더니 손에 들고 있던 구두를 내려다보았다. 그녀가 다시 웃었다. 그리고 나를 다시 보더니 손에 들고  있던  구두를  내려놓았다.\\n그녀(에스텔라)는  여전히  나를  소년으로  대했다.  하지만  나를 계속 유혹했다.\\n\\u3000우리는 꿈결 같은 방에서, 내게 깊은 인상을 주었던 오래되고 낮선 영향들 사이로 앉아  있었다.\\n\\u3000곧 나는 알았다. 에스텔라가 프랑스에서 막 돌아왔다는 사실을 그리고 그녀가 조만간 런던으로 갈 거라는 사실을.\\n\\u3000그녀는 그대로였다. 예전처럼 거만하고 제멋대로였다. 하지만 그러한 자질들을 가져다 자신의 아름다움 속에 종속시키고 있었다. 그래서 거만하고 제멋대로인 것을 그녀의 아름다움과 떼어내서 생각하는 것은 불가능했고 본질에도 맞지 않았다. 적어도 난 그리 생각했다.\\n\\u3000내 소년기를 훼방 놓았던 돈과 상류계급에 대한 추구 그러한 모든 비참한 열망으로부터 그녀의 존재를 떼어내서 생각하는 것은 실로 불 가능했다.\\n\\u3000생전 처음 내 집과 ‘조’(주인공의 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 매형, 대 장장이)를 창피하게 여기게 만들었던 그 모든 부당한 염원들로부터 그 녀의 존재를 떼어내서 생각하는 것도 실로 불가능했다.\\n\\u3000작열하는 불길 속에서 그녀의 얼굴이 떠올랐던 환상들과, ‘모루’(대장간 쇠 받침대) 위에 쇠에 놓았을 때 그녀의 얼굴이 떠올라 미친 듯이 해머 질을 했었던 환상들과, 밤의 어둠 속에서 형성된 그녀의 얼굴이 대장간 목재창문을 사이로 안을 들여다보다 휙 스치듯 사라져 버렸던 그 모든 상상들로부터 그녀의 존재를 떼어내서 생각하는 것은 진실로 불가능했다.\\n\\u3000한 마디로 말해, 내 가장 깊숙한 내면세계로부터, 과거든 현재든, 내가 그녀를 떼어내는 것은 있을 수 없는 일이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 마음먹었다. 미스 해비샴의 저택에서 그 날의 나머지시간을 모두 보내고 저녁 늦게 호텔로 돌아갔다가 내일 런던으로 상경하기로 마음먹었다.\\n\\u3000나와 에스텔라가 잠깐 대화를 나누는 사이, 미스 해비샴이 산책을 다녀오라며 우리를 방치된 정원으로  보냈다.\\n\\u3000다만 머지않은 시각에 돌아와 예전에 그랬던 것처럼 자신이 탄 의자를 잠깐 동안 밀어줘야 한다고 말했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 에스테라와 나는, 내가 길을 잃다 ‘창백한  어린  신사’(허버 트)와 만났을 때 통과했었던 통로를 통해 정원으로 들어섰다. 물론 여기서 말하는 ‘창백한 어린 신사’란 지금의 허버트(주인공의 절친)를 말 한다.\\n\\u3000나는 영혼까지 떨려와 에스텔라가 입고 있는 옷의 가장자리 단(안으로 접어 붙인 부분)까지 숭배하고 있었다. 하지만 그녀는 매우 침착해 보였다. 그리고 상대방의 옷 가장자리 단을 숭배하는 모습 따윈 확실히  거부하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 허버트를 만났던 장소 가까이에 다다랐을 때, 그녀가 걸음을 멈추더니 말했다.\\n\\u3000“숨어서 그 날 그 싸움을 지켜보고 있었다니 난 정말 특이한 아이였음이 분명해. 하지만 난 지켜보았고, 사실은 아주 즐겼지.”\\n“그 답례(그녀의 뺨에 입맞춤)가 내겐 너무도 큰 보상이었어.”\\n   “내가 그랬니?” 그녀가 별 대수롭지 않다는 듯 그리고 그 일을 잊었다는  듯 말했다.\\n\\u3000“난 네 적수(허버트)에게 대단한 이의를 품고 있었던 걸로 기억해. 그런 애가 여기 온다는 것도 받아들이기 힘든 데 날 귀찮게까지 하지\\n\\n\\n뭐니.”\\n“그 앤 지금 내  절친(친구)이야.”\\n\\u3000“그러니? 그러고 보니 그 애 아버지가 네 공부를 봐준다는  소식은  들은  것 같아.”\\n“그래.”\\n\\u3000나의 이러한 인정은 내키지 않는 것이었다. 왜냐하면 그것엔(누군가가 자신의 공부를 돌봐준다는 것) 뭔가 소년 같은 모습이 있었기 때문이다.\\n그녀는 이미 나를 소년보다 더 소년같이 대하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“네 운과 미래에 대한 변화만큼이나 네 친구들도 달라졌겠구나.” 에 스텔라가 말했다.\\n“당연히….”  내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“필연적인지도 몰라.” 그녀가 다소 도도한  말투로  덧붙였다.  “한때  네 친구로 적합하던 사람들이, 지금의 네 친구론 아주 부적합할 수도 있으니까.”\\n\\u3000조(주인공의 매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물, 주인공은  조를  많이 창피해하고 있음)를 만날 생각이 조금이라도 내게 있었는지 그 질질 끄는 의향이라도 있었는지 도저히 의심해보지 않을 수 없다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이미 결판났다. 만약 내게 그러한 의향(조를 만날 의향)이 있었다고 해도, 그녀의 이 발언이 그런 내 생각을 “확” 달아나게 만들었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“그때까지만 해도, 네 앞에 펼쳐질 행운에  대한  개념은  없었겠구나?” 에스텔라가 손을 가볍게 흔들면서 말했다. 나와 허버트와의 싸움이 있던 어릴 때를 의미하는 것 같았다.\\n“조금도 없었어.”\\n\\u3000내 옆에서 완벽하고 우월한 태도로 걷고 있는 그녀의 모습과,  그런  그녀 옆에서 젊은이특유의 굴복하는 자세로 걷고 있는 내 모습은 큰 대조를 이루었다. 나는 그 대조를 너무도 가슴 아프게 자각하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 그녀를 위해 따로 챙겨져 할당된 존재로써 그런 생각(그녀와 주인공 사이의 크나큰 대조)을 이끌어낸 것임을 내 스스로 생각하지 못했다면, 그것은(큰 대조) 실제보다 더 오랫동안 내 마음에 사무쳤을 것이다.\\n\\u3000정원엔 풀이 너무 크고 지나치게 무성하게 자라 있어 걷기가 쉽지 않았다.\\n\\u3000두 번 혹은 세 번 정원을 마저 돈 후, 우리는 맥주공장의 안뜰로 다     시 들어섰다.\\n\\u3000나는 그녀에게 정확하게  가리켰다. 내가  여기에 처음 왔을 때  그녀   가 큰 통들 위를 걸어가던 장소를 나는 정확하게 가리켰다.\\n\\u3000그러자 그녀가 아주 냉담하게 그러면서 그 쪽 방향을 무관심하게 바 라보며 말했다.\\n“내가 그랬니?”\\n\\u3000나는 그녀에게 그녀가 그 저택에서부터 걸어 나와 나에게 고기며 음 료수(따뜻하게 데운 맥주를 의미함)를 준 일을 상기시켰다.\\n그러자 그녀가 말했다. “기억  안 나는데.”\\n“그럼 날(주인공) 울렸던 일도 기억 안나?” 내가 말했다. “그래.” 그녀가 고개를 흔든 후 여기저기를 보며 말했다.\\n\\u3000나는 정말로 믿는다. 그녀가 조금도 기억 못하고 있다고 그리고 그녀가 조금도 마음에 담아두지 않았다고. 그것이 나를 마음속 깊이 다시 울게 만들었다. 나는 정말로 믿는다. 그 눈물이 모든 눈물들 중에서도 가장 날카로운  울음이었다고.\\n\\u3000“넌 알아야해.” 가끔 훌륭하고 아름다운 여성이 내게 일부러 공손하게 대하듯, 에스텔라도 그렇게 말을 하고 있었다. “난 심장이 없어. 그게 만약 내 지난 기억과 관련된 것들이라면 더욱더.”\\n\\u3000내가 그 말을 의심한다는 효과를 내기 위해 몇 마디 알아들을 수 없는 허튼소리를 내뱉고 말았다. 그 문제라면 내가 더 잘 알 것 같다고.  심장 없이 어떻게 이런 아름다운 미인이 존재할 수 있느냐고.\\n\\u3000“오! 칼로 찌를 수 있고 총에 맞을 수 있는 심장은 내게도 있어. 그건 거절할 수 없는 사실이니까.” 에스텔라가 말했다. “당연히 심장이  뛰지 않는다면 내 삶도 멈출 테니까. 하지만 넌 알겠지, 내가 무슨 말을 하고 있는지. 내 심장엔 부드러움이 없다는 말이었어. 내 심장엔 동정이라느니 감정이라느니 하는 그런 허튼 게 들어갈 자리가 없어.”\\n\\u3000그녀는 가만히 서서 나를 주의 깊게 쳐다봤을  때, 문득  내 마음 속에서 떠오르는 것이 있었다. 그것이 무엇이었을까? 그녀에게서 미스 해비샴과 닮은 점을 내가 발견했던 것일까? 그렇지 않았다.\\n\\u3000물론 그녀의 외모와 행동에는 미스 해비샴을 연상시키는 기운이 얼마간 남아있었다. 하지만 그것은 어릴 적부터 어른과 오래 같이 지낸 아이들에게서 흔히 보이는 후천적인  닮음이었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 그것은 어린 시절을 통과한 후 완전히 다른 두 얼굴들 사이에서 예외적으로 유사한 표정이 이따금씩 보이곤 하는 그런 유의 닮음이었다.\\n\\u3000그럼에도 불구하고 나는 이 자취를 미스 해비샴과 연결시킬 순 없었다.\\n\\u3000나는 다시 그녀를 보았다. 비록 그녀는 여전히 나를 쳐다보고  있었지만 방금 전의 그 이미지는 사라졌다.\\n그것이 무엇이었을까?\\n\\u3000 “난 지금 심각하게 말하고 있어.” 에스텔라가 말했다.  하지만 아주  많이 언짢아하는 표정은 아니었다. 왜냐하면 그녀의 이마가 부드러웠기 때문이다. 단지 표정이 어두웠다.\\n그녀가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“우리가 자주 만나야한다면, 방금 내가 한 말(”난 심장이 없어”)을 즉시 믿는 게 좋아. (주인공이 무슨 말을 하려하자) 아냐!”\\n\\u3000내가 뭐라고 입술을 벌리려고 하자 그녀가 고압적으로 제지하며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“내 애정을 다른 곳에 두었기 때문이 아냐. 난 절대 그런 짓은 하지 않을 테니까.”\\n\\u3000다음 순간 우리는 맥주공장 안에 있었다. 그곳은 아주 오래전부터 사용되지  않던 곳이었다.\\n\\u3000그녀가  아주 높은  좌석을 가리켰다. 그 곳은  내가 이 곳에 처음 온 날 그녀가 빠져 나가는 것을 보았던 곳(맥주공장 내부 맨 위쪽 관람석 좌석)이기도 했다.\\n그녀가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“난 기억나. 내가 저 위쪽에 있었던 것과 네(주인공)가 이 아래에서  겁을 집어 먹고 서 있던 걸 내가 본 일을 말이야.”\\n\\u3000내 시선이 그녀의 하얀 손에  닿았다. 그 순간 내게 혼선을 주며 아무리 해도 움켜쥘 수 없는 아까와 같은 흐릿한 연상이 떠올랐다.\\n\\u3000본의 아니게 내가  놀라자 그녀가 내 팔에 손을 얹어 주었고, 그 즉시 환영(유령)이 다시 한 번 지나가더니 이내 사라졌다.\\n그것은 무엇이었을까?\\n“무슨 문제 있니?” 에스텔라가 물었다. “아님 다시 두려워진 거니?” “아마도, 방금 전에 네가 한 그 말을 내가 믿는다면 두려웠겠지.” 내\\n가 논지에서 벗어난 말을 했다.\\n\\u3000“그럼 안 믿는단 말이니? 알았어. 어쨌든 난 말했으니까. 미스 해비 샴이 기다리겠다. 네가 옛날처럼 의자를  밀어주길 바라나봐.  내 생각엔, 그녀가 다른 익숙한 소유물(재산)들과 함께 운동도 그만둘 것 같지만 말이야. 어떠니, 정원 한 바퀴만 더 돌고 갈까, 그러자. 어서! 걱정마 내 잔인한 행위 때문에 오늘만큼은 네가 눈물 흘릴 일은 없을 테니까. 넌 오늘 내 시동(시중을 드는 아이)이 되어야하니까, 우선은 네 어깨를  좀 빌릴까.”\\n\\u3000그녀가 입고 있던 멋있는 옷이 지면에 끌렸다. 그녀가 한 손으로 옷을 잡고서 다른 한 손을 내 어깨 위에 가볍게 얹었다. 우리는 그렇게 걸었다.\\n\\u3000폐허가 다 된 이 정원을 우리는 그런 식으로 두 번 혹은 세 번을 더 돌았다. 내겐 그 정원 곳곳에 꽃이 활짝 핀 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000오래된 벽의 갈라진 틈들에 핀 그 황록색(녹색과 노란색)의 잡초들이 그때까지 피웠었던 가장 값비싼 꽃들이었다손 치더라도, 내 추억 속에서 이 정도로까지 소중히 간직되진 못했을 것이다.\\n\\u3000그녀를 나로부터 멀어지게 하는 연령의 차이 같은 건 우리사이에 전혀 없었다.\\n우리들은 거의 동갑이었다.(부연설명 : 둘 다 19세입니다.) 물론 그녀가 나보다 몇 살 많아 보였지만.\\n\\u3000하지만 그녀의 아름다움과 태도가 그녀 자신에게 부여하고 있는 그 접근하기 어려운 분위기 때문에 난 내 환희의 한복판에서도 고통 받았다.\\n\\u3000그리고 우리의 여성 후원자(미스 해비샴을 의미함)가 우리를 서로를 위한 배필로 정해주다는 내 확신이 최고조에 이르렀을 때조차도 나는 그녀의 아름다움과 태도가 그녀 자신에게 부여하고 있는 그 접근하기 어려운 분위기 때문에 고통받았다.\\n가련한 녀석!\\n마침내 우리들이 저택으로  되돌아왔다.\\n\\u3000거기서 난 놀라운 소식을 하나 들었는데, 내 후견인(재거스 변호사, 미스 해비샴의 고문 변호사)이 미스 해비샴을 업무 차 만나러 방문했었으며 저녁식사시간 때 다시 오실 거라는 것이었다.\\n\\u3000우리들이 외출하는 동안, 썩고 있던 식탁이 넓게 자리 잡고 있던 방안 ‘샹들리에’(천장 장식용 고급 전등)들에 매달린 ‘낡고 황량한 나뭇 가지들’(촛대)에는 불이 밝혀져  있었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 미스 해비샴(어마어마한 갑부)이 그녀의 의자에 앉은 채 나를  기다리고 있었다.\\n\\u3000우리가 결혼식 축하연 잿더미 주위를 둥근 원을 그리며 익숙하게 서서히 돌았을 때, 그건 마치 의자 자체를 과거의 원위치로 되돌리는 것 만 같았다.\\n\\u3000하지만, 구슬픈 그 방에서 시체 같은 사람이 의자에 등을 바짝 기댄채 자신(미스 해비샴)의 시선을 그녀(에스텔라)에게 고정하고 있었음에도 에스텔라는 전보다  더  빛나보였고  아름다워  보였다.  그것이  나를 더 강렬하게 그녀에게  매혹시켰다.\\n\\u3000시간이  그렇게 차츰 녹아 사라져,  우리가 이른 저녁식사를 들  시간이 다가왔다.\\n\\u3000그녀 자신을 준비(꾸밈)하기 위해 에스텔라가 방을  나갔다. 우리는 그때 긴 식탁 중앙 가까이에 멈춰 서 있었는데, 의자 밖으로  다 말라  빠진 두 팔 중 하나를 내민 채 미스 해비샴의 꽉 쥔 손이 색이 바란  식탁보 위에 받쳐져  있었다.\\n\\u3000문을 나서기 전 에스텔라가 어깨 너머로 뒤돌아보자, 미스 해비샴이 그 손(꽉 쥔 손)으로 탐욕스러울 정도로 집요하게 키스를 보냈다. 그건 굉장히 무서운 종류의  강렬함이었다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 사라진 다음 우리는 둘만 남게 되었다. 미스 해비샴이 내게로 고개를 돌리더니 다음과 같이 속삭였다.\\n\\u3000“저 애가 아름답니, 저 애가 우아하니, 저 애가 잘 자란 것 같으냐?     저  애를 찬양하느냐?”\\n\\u3000“그녀를 보는 모든 사람들이 다 그렇게 생각할 거예요, 미스 해비샴 마님.”\\n\\u3000그녀가 한 팔로 내 목을 끌어당겼다. 그리고 의자에 앉은 채로 내  고개를 그녀의 고개 쪽으로 내려서 끌어당겼다.\\n\\u3000“저 애를 사랑하거라, 저 애를 사랑해, 저 애를 사랑하고 또 사랑하 거라! 저 애가 그를 어떻게 이용하더냐?”\\n\\u3000적어도 내가 그 어려운 질문에 대답을 할 수 있었다면 내가 채 대답     도 하기 전에, 그녀가 다시 말했다.\\n\\u3000“저 애를 사랑하거라, 저 애를 사랑해, 저 애를 사랑하고 또 사랑하 거라! 저 애가 네게 친절을 베풀면 저 애를 사랑해라. 만약 저 애가 네게 상처를 입히더라도 저애를 사랑해라. 만약 저 애가 네 심장을 갈기  갈기 찢어놓더라도, 넌 저 애를 사랑해야한다. 저 애를 사랑하고, 또 사랑해야한다! 나이가 들고 더 강해질수록 네 상처는 더욱더 깊어질 테지.”\\n\\u3000이러한 말들(“그녀를 사랑해라”)을 내뱉으면서 그녀가 보인 그런 열정적인 갈망을 나는 일찍이 단 한 번도 접한 적이 없었다.\\n\\u3000내 목을 감은 얇은 팔의 근육들이 그녀를 홀린 열정들에 이끌려 부풀어오는 것을 나는 느낄 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“잘 들어라, 핍(주인공이름)! 난 저 애를 입양했다. 그건 저 애가 사랑을 받게 하기 위해서였다. 내가 저 애를 길렀고 교육시켰다. 그건 모두 저 애가 사랑을 받게 하기 위해서였다. 내가 저 애를 지금의 모습으로 키운 것도 모두 저 애가 그 사랑을 받을 수 있도록 하기 위해서다. 그러니 저 애를  사랑해주어라!”\\n\\u3000그녀는 매우 빈번하게 그 단어(“사랑”)를 사용했다. 그녀에게 그 단어가 무엇을 의미하는지는 의심할 것도 없었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 만일 그토록 자주 되풀이되던 단어가 “사랑”이란 단어 대신에 “증오”였어도, 아니 그 단어가 “절망”이었어도, 아니 그 단어가 “복 수”였어도, 아니 그 단어가 “무시무시한 죽음”을 지칭하는 단어였어도, 그녀의 두 입술에서 이토록 저주스럽게 들릴 수는 없었을 것이다.\\n\\u3000그녀(미스 해비샴)이 여전히 성마르고 정열적인 어조로 속삭이며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“진정한 사랑이 뭔지 아느냐. 그건 눈 먼 헌신이다. 그건 무조건적인 겸손이며 완전한 복종이다. 그것은 신뢰이자 ‘네 자신과 전 세계에 맞선 신앙’이다. 알겠느냐, 네 모든 심장과 영혼을 강타자(연인)에게 산체로 넘기는 것이다. 내가  그러했듯이.”\\n\\u3000“내가 그러했다”는 말까지 나왔을 때, 그녀가 야생적인 외마디 고함을 내질렀다. 내가 그녀의 허리 주의를 붙잡아야했다. 왜냐하면 그녀가 수의(죽은 사람의 몸을 씻긴 뒤 입히는 옷) 같은 드레스를 입은 상태로 폭동을 일으키듯이 의자에서 일어나 허공을 향해 덤벼들었기 때문이다. 그 행동은 마치 그녀가 이대로 벽에 부딪쳐 죽어  넘어지고 말겠 다는  태도 같았다.\\n\\u3000몇 초 사이에 이 모든 소란이 지나갔다. 내가 그녀를 다시 부축해  의자에 앉히자, 내가 익히 알고 있는 비누향수 냄새가 남을 알아챘다.  내가 고개를 돌렸을 때 내 후견인(재거스  변호사)이  방안에  서 있는 것이 보였다.\\n\\u3000내가 아직 언급 안 한 것이 하나 있는 것 같은데, 그건 바로 재거스  씨가 꼭 손수건을 휴대하고 다닌다는 사실이다. 아주 화려한 비단으로 만들어진 손수건, 인상적일 만큼 커다란 손수건을 그는 항상 휴대하고 다녔는데, 그건 변호사란 그의 직업상 그에게 대단히 중요한 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000마치 그가 당장에라도 코를 풀 것처럼 그 손수건을 지나치게 격식을 갖추며 펼침으로써 의뢰인(고객)이나 증인을 아주 겁먹게 하는 모습을 내가 여러 번 보았었기 때문이다. 그러다가 그는 그 행동을 딱 멈추었는데, 마치 의뢰인이나 증인이 분명한 태도를 나타내기 전엔 그와 같이 행동할 여유를 자신이 가지면 안 됨을 그가 퍼뜩 생각했다는 것만 같았다. 그러면 아주 당연하게도 의뢰인이나 증인들의 자기 서약(맹세)  이  곧바로 이어졌다.\\n\\u3000내가 방안에서 그를 보고 있는 이 순간에도, 그는 예의 그 손수건 행사 례(코풀기)를 하려고 두 손으로 폼을 잡고 있었다. 그는 우리를 지켜보고  있었던 것이다.\\n\\u3000내 눈이 그의 눈과 마주치자, 그가 코풀기 바로 전 자세에서 멈칫하며 말없이 정지하든이 솔직히 속마음을 털어났다.\\n“정말이오? 그거 참  놀랍소!”\\n\\u3000그런 다음 불가사의할 정도로까지 효과적으로(보는 이로 하여금 두 려움을 줄 정도로) 손수건에다 코를 풀어댔다.\\n\\u3000내가 재거스 씨를 보자마자 미스 해비샴도  재거스  씨를  발견했다. 다른 사람들이 그러하듯이 그녀는 그를 두려워했다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 자기감정을 가다듬으려고 애쓰면서 다음과 같이 말을 더듬었다.\\n“여전히… 약속 시간을…  엄수하시는군요.”\\n\\u3000“전 언제나 약속 시간을 엄수했습니다, 미스 해비샴.” 그가 우리 쪽으로  걸어오며 대답했다.\\n\\u3000“(주인공에게) 그래 어떻게 지냈나, 핍? (미스 해비샴에게) 제가 좀 태워드릴까요, 미스 해비샴? 한 바퀴면 되겠죠? (주인공에게) 그래서  여기  있었던  거군, 핍?”\\n\\u3000나는 그에게 내가  언제  도착했는지,  그리고  미스  해비샴이  언질을 줘 내가 에스텔라를 만나러 내려왔노라고 그에게 설명해주었다.\\n\\u3000그러자 그가 “아! 그 대단히 아름다운 젊은 숙녀분 말인가!”라며 답했다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 그는 미스 해비샴이 탄 의자를 뒤에서 밀었다. 두 손으로  미는 것이 아니라 자신의 커다란 두 손들 중 한 손으로  밀었다. 다른  손은 마치 자신의 호주머니 속에는 비밀이 가득하다는 듯이 바지 호주머니 속에 집어넣고  있었다.\\n\\u3000 “그러고 보니, 핍(주인공이름)! 자네 에스텔라 양(미스)을 얼마나 자주 만난 거지? 전에 말일세.” 그가  한 바퀴 돌았을 때  나를 보며 말했다.\\n“얼마나 자주라뇨?”\\n“아! 얼마나 여러 번 말일세. 한 만 번쯤은 되나?” \\n“어! 만 번이라니요. 택도  없죠.”\\n“그럼  두 번?”\\n\\u3000“재거스.” 나로서는 대단히 다행스럽게도 미스 해비샴이 제지하며 말했다. “핍은 내버려두게. 저 애를 데리고 저녁이나 먹으러 가시게.”\\n\\u3000재거스 씨가 그 말을 따랐다. 우리는 함께 손으로 더듬어 가며 어두운  계단을 내려왔다.\\n\\u3000우리가 저택 뒤쪽에 있는 ‘포장된 안뜰’ 맞은편에 있는 ‘외따로 떨어져 있는 집들’을 향해 여전히 가고 있는 도중에, 재거스 씨가 내게 또 물었다.\\n“그래, 미스 해비샴이 먹고 마시는 것을 얼마나 자주 보았나?”라고. 그는 여느 때와 같이 “백번? 아님 한 번 보았나?”라며 한 다발의 선\\n택폭을 제시했다.\\n\\u3000나는 잘 생각해본 끝에 이렇게 대답했다.  “전혀요.”(미스  해비샴이 먹고 마시는 것을 전혀 본 적이 없습니다.)\\n\\u3000“그 ‘전혀’란 말이 앞으로도 이어질 걸세, 핍.” 재거스 씨가 눈살을 찌푸리며 웃더니 결국 삐딱하게 응수했다. “그녀가 현재와 같은 이런  삶을 시작했을 때부터, 먹는 모습이든 마시는 모습이든 남들에게 보이는 걸 결코 허용하지 않고 있으니까. 밤이면 여기저기 종잡을 수 없이 어슬렁거리며 손에 집히는 대로 음식을 먹는다지 아마.”\\n“그럼 저도 질문 하나만 해도 되나요?

향했다.\\n\\u3000여관에 도착해보니, 허버트(주인공의 친구. 약간 허풍이 심하지만 착함. 19세)가 식은 고기로 식사를 하고 있었다. 그가 내 귀가를 기쁘게 환영해주었다.\\n\\u3000일단 ‘돈 먹는 하마 녀석(심부름꾼 소년)’을 커피하우스로 보내 내가 먹을 추가분의 저녁식사를 가져오라며 떼어낸 후에야, 난 마음을 열고 오늘 꼭 내 친구에게 모두 말해야겠다는 생각이 들었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 ‘원수 같은  녀석(심부름꾼  소년)’이  여전히  홀에  있어 지금 이 문제를 허버트와 의논해보았자 소용없었다. 홀이 열쇠 구멍이 딸린 방임으로 감안하면 그랬다. 그래서 녀석을 연극구경 보냈다.\\n\\u3000녀석이 할 일을 찾아주기 위해, 내가 끊임없이 내몰려야했던 모멸적인 궁여지책들보다, ‘작업할당 원(감독)’의 직책에 내가 얼마나 고통스럽게 속박당하고 있었는지를 더 잘 보여주는 증거는 찾을 수 없다.\\n\\u3000이 비열한 궁여지책들이  얼마나 지나쳤는지, 나는 이따금씩 녀석에게 일을 찾아주기 위해 지금 몇 시인지 알아보고 오라며 ‘하이드 공원 (런던의 공원)’ 모퉁이(구석)로 녀석을 보내기까지 했다.\\n\\u3000저녁 식사를 마친 후 우리는 함께 발을 난로의 철사 망 위에 올려놓     은  채로 앉았다.\\n내가 허버트(절친, 19세)에게  말했다.\\n“있잖아,  허버트.  꼭  얘기해야  될  것  같은  게  하나  생겼어.” “친애하는  헨델(주인공의  애칭).”  그가  맞대응했다.  “나를 신뢰해준\\n것을 고맙게 생각해 그리고 네 신뢰에 대해 존중해주겠어.” (← -_-    대책  없는 해석)\\n\\u3000“나에 관한 얘기야, 허버트.” 내가 말했다. “그리고 또 다른 한 사람에 관한 얘기이기도  하고….”\\n\\u3000허버트가 자신의 두 다리를 서로 교차시키더니, 고개를 옆으로 돌려 벽난로를 바라다보며, 그러면서 잠깐 동안 허망한 눈망울로 벽난로를 바라보다, 내가 얘기를 더 진행하지 않자 다시 나를 쳐다봤다.\\n\\u3000“허버트” 내가 내 손을 그의 무릎 위에 가만히 대며 말했다. “나는 그녀를 사랑해. 아니 숭배해.  에스텔라를….”\\n\\u3000내 갑작스런 말에  그 자리에서 옴쭉 못하는 대신, 허버트가 편안하     고 말할 나위 없이 당연하다는 태도로 대답했다.\\n“맞아. 어?”\\n“어라니, 허버트? 그게 네가 얘기할 수 있는 전부니? ‘어?’란 말이?” “이어지는  말은  무엇으로  하겠느냐고?”  허버트가  말했다.  “당연히\\n나도 그 사실을 알고 있었어, 지.”\\n“네가? 네가 어떻게 알았어?” 내가 말했다 .\\n\\u3000“이런, 내가 어떻게 알았느냐고? 당연히 너를 보고 알았지, 헨델(주 인공의 애칭).”\\n“난 한 번도 네게 그런 얘기를 한 적이 없는데.”\\n\\u3000“어떻게 알았느냐고, 핍. 네가 이발을 했을 때 네가 굳이 말하지 않아도 난 그걸 감지할 정도의 지각은 있단다. 넌  항상  그녀를  숭배해왔 어. 심지어 내가 너를 처음 마주친 순간부터 말이야. 네가 여기로 왔을  때 넌 작은 여행 가방과 함께 그녀에 대한 숭배도 함께 가지고 왔단다. 내가 어떻게 알았느냐고, 핍! 이런, 넌 내게 밤새도록 얘기를 했었 어. 내게 네 자신의 얘기를 들려줄 때, ‘그녀를 처음 본 순간부터 숭배 해오기 시작했어. 내가 정말 아주 어렸을 때인데도 말이야’라고 넌 내게 분명히 얘기했었단다,  핍.”\\n“그럼 좋아.”\\n\\u3000그의 말이 새로웠지만 못 받아들일 것도 없노라고 허버트에게 말했다.\\n내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“난 그녀에 대한 숭배를 단 한 번도 관둔 적이 없어. 이제 그녀가 귀국했어. 전보다 훨씬 더 아름다운 여성으로 그리고 전보다 훨씬 더 우아한 여성으로 말이야. 어제 그녀를 만났는데, 만일 내게 그녀를 전에 숭배했었다면, 나는 지금 그녀를 두 배로 숭배하게 되었어.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 네겐 행운이 일어난 거야, 헨델(주인공의 애칭).” 허버트(주인 공의 절친, 19세)가 말했다. “넌 그녀의 배필로 정해졌잖니 그녀에게 할당된 거라고. 금기(주인공의 유산에 대한 정보를 캐지 말 것)를 깨지 않으면서도, 우린 이렇게 말해볼 수 있지 않니? 네가 그녀의 배필로 뽑혔다는 것에 대해 우리 둘 사이에 어떤 의심도 없노라고. 아직 뭐 들은 얘긴 없니? 네가 그녀를 숭배하는 문제에 대한 에스텔라의 생각에  관해서 말이야.”\\n나는 침울한 표정을 지으며 고개를 가로저었다.\\n\\u3000“아니! 그녀는 지금 나와 수백 킬로미터나 떨어져 있는걸.”라고 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“침착해, 헨델(주인공의 애칭). 시간은 넉넉하고 충분히 있으니까. 하지만 내게 해줄 말이 더 있는 것 아니었니?”\\n\\u3000“차마 말하기 부끄러운 사실이어서 그래.” 내가 대답했다. “그럼에도 불구하고 생각하는 것보단 털어놓는다고 상황이 더 나빠지는 건 아니 니까. 넌 나보고 행운아라고 그랬지. 맞아, 난 행운아야. 하지만 어제 까지만  해도  대장간의  한낱  심부름꾼  소년이었는걸.  난  사실… 내가 도대체 무슨 말을 하려든 걸까…오…늘?”\\n\\u3000“만약 적절한 단어가 떠오르지 않는다면, 네가  지금  ‘착한 사람’이 되어 있노라고 말해두렴.” 허버트가 미소 지으며 그리고 내 등을 살짝 두드려주면서 말했다.\\n\\u3000“‘착한 애’ 말이야. 성급함과 망설임, 그리고 대담함과 자신 없음, 그리고 행동과 꿈이 네 안에 기묘한 방식으로 혼합되어 있는 ‘착한 애’ 말이야. 넌 착한  애니까.”\\n\\u3000난 잠시 멈추고 생각해보았다. 과연 내 성격 안에 그런 혼합물(성급함과 망설임, 그리고 대담함과 자신 없음)이 정말로 있는지를 생각해보 았다.\\n\\u3000대체적으로 그 분석에 동의할 수 없었지만 논쟁까지 할 가치가 있다곤  생각지 않았다.\\n\\u3000“허버트(주인공의 절친), 지금 내 모습을 뭐라고 불러야 할지 내가 물었을 땐 말이야.” 내가 얘기를 계속했다. “나도 나름 생각한 게 있어 서야. 내가 운이 좋다고 말했니. 하지만 내 스스로 무언가를 이룬 적은  단 한 번도 없는 걸. 지금 이 모습도 마찬가지야. 단지 돈이 현재의 나를 치장해주었을 뿐이야. 그걸 운이라니 운이라고 해두자. 그럼에도 불구하고 에스텔라가 떠오를  때면….”\\n\\u3000“그럼 네가 그녀를 생각하지 않을 때가  있었니?” 허버트가 벽난로  위로 시선을 던지며 말했다. 나는 그것을 녀석의 친절과 공감으로 생각했다.\\n\\u3000“그럴 때면, 허버트(주인공의 절친 이름), 난 이 말을 네게 들려주지 않을 수 없어. 내가 얼마나 의존적이고 불확실하게 내 자신을 느끼고 있는지, 수많은 우연들에 노출되어 있다고 내가 얼마나 느끼는지를. 방금 전에 네가 말했듯 금기(주인공의 유산에 대한 정보를 캐지 말 것)를 피해 말하자면, 난 여전히 이렇게 밖에 말할 수 없어. 내 유산은 오 로지 내가 이름도 모르는 어느 누군가의 불변성(지조)에 의존하고 있다고. 단지 그 유산이 무엇인지 아주 어렴풋하게만 알고 있어, 이 얼마나 막연하고 불만스러운  일이니!”\\n\\u3000이런 말들을 하면서 난, 그동안 가슴속에 담아두었던, 사실상, 에스 텔라를 만난 어제 이후부턴 의심할 바 없이 최고조로 치닫던 내 마음을 털어놓았다(없앴다). \\n\\n(아래의 글 전부 다 허버트의 대사입니다. 좀 길어요.)\\n\\n\\u3000“자, 헨델(주인공의 애칭).” 허버트(주인공의 절친, 19세)가 명랑하고 희망에 찬 태도로  응답했다.\\n\\u3000“사랑을 부르는 선율에 낙담해 있을 때 우리는 확대경(돋보기)을 통해 공짜로 받은 물건이나 선물에 대해 흠을 잡는 경향이 있는 것 같아. 게다가, 확대경으로 검토를 하려고 정신을 집중할 때 우리는 사물의 가장 좋은 면들 중 하나를 완전히 간과해버리는 경향이 있는 것 같아, 적어도 내 생각엔  그래.\\n\\u3000(내용이 길어서 단락을 임의로 나누었습니다. 모두 허버트의 긴 대사 입니다.)\\n\\u3000내게 처음에 말하지 않았니? 내 후견인(주인공에게 유산을 주는 사람이 아님. 그냥 법률 후견인임)인 재거스 씨(사람이름)가 다음과 같이 말했다고. 넌  막대한 재산만  증여받게 되어있는  것이 아니라고? 심지어 그가 그렇게 말했다손 치더라도, 이건 내가 승인한 매우 커다란 가 정인데, 어떠니? 네 생각은? 런던에 있는 이 많은 사람들 중, 재거스 씨(변호사이름)가 아무런 근거도 없이 너와의 관계를 유지할 사람으로 보이니?”\\n\\n“네 말도 일리가 있어. 부정하진 않을 게.” 내가 말했다. 나는 또 이 말도 했다.\\n\\u3000“이런 경우 사람들이 흔히 말하듯, 내가 진실과 정의에 대한 너무 성급한 양보를 하고 있는 지도 몰라. 마치 내가 그걸(허버트의 말에 일 리가 있다) 부정하고 싶듯이 말이야!”\\n\\u3000“나도 내 말에 일리가 있다곤 생각해.” 허버트가 말했다. “그리고 그 보다 더 강도가 센 말을 네가 생각해내긴 당혹스러울 거라고도 생각해. 그 나머지(사랑)에 관해서는, 넌 네 후견인(재거스 씨)이 말할 때까지 기다려야 해. 그리고 네 후견인(재거스 씨)은 의뢰인(주인공에게 유산을 주려는 수수께끼 인물)이 말할 준비가 될 때까지 기다려야 하고. 네가 어디에 서 있는지 미처 알기도 전에 넌 스물한 살이 될 거고. 그럼 넌 좀 더 이해하게 될 거야. 여하튼 너는 점점 더 그 해답에 다가가게 될 거야, 그게 결국엔 오게 되어 있을 거니까.”\\n\\u3000“너 정말 낙천적인 성격을 가지고 있구나!” 그가 주는 기분 좋은 분위기가 너무너무 좋아 내가 고마워도 하고 감탄하기도 하며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“너도 알잖니, 내게 그런 거라도 있어야지.” 허버트(20세)가 말했다. “그것 외에는 가진 게 별로 없으니까. 그건 그렇고, 내가 방금 말한 것들에 대한 양식이며 분별이 내 자신의 것이 아니라 내 아버지의 사상임을 인정안 할 수 없구나. 네 이야기를 들으시고 아버지께서 결정적인 논평 하나를 하셨지. 네 이야기에 대한 그의 유일한 논평이기도 해.  ‘그 일은 자리를 잡았고 완료되었다. 그렇지 않다면야, 재거스 씨(런런의 유명 변호사)가 이 일에 관여하고 있겠니.’ 그건 그렇고 내 아버지와 내 아버지의 아들에 대해 더 말하기 전에, 그리고 신뢰(주인공의 고 백)를 신뢰(허버트의 격려)로 갚기 전에, 내가 잠시 동안 너에게 아주 불쾌하고 명백히 매정하게 굴려고  하는데….”\\n“넌 그러지 못할 거야.” 내가 말했다. \\n\\u3000“아니 난 할 거야!” 허버트(20세)가 말했다. “하나, 둘, 셋, 자 난 물 러나려야 물러날 수 없게 됐어. 헨델(주인공의 애칭, 귀여운 별명), 내 여린 친구야.” 그가 비록 가벼운 농담조로 말했지만 확실히 심각하게 말하고 있었다. “내가 생각해 오던 게 있어. 우리가 펜더(벽난로의 철사 망 위)에 발을 올려놓고 대화를 시작했을 때부터 난 이런 생각이 들었단다. 에스텔라가 확실히 네 상속재산의 조건이 아닐 수도 있다는 거야. 내 후견인(재거스 변호사)이 그녀에 대해 단 한 차례도 언급한   적이 없었다면서. 네가 나에게 들려주었던 이야기들을 내가 완전히 이 해한 거라면, 적어도 네 후견인은 그녀에 대해 전혀 언급하지 않았다는 거야, 어때, 틀렸니? 예를 들어볼까, 그(재거스 씨)에게서 어떤  힌트도 없었지? 네  후원자(주인공에게 재산을  물려주려는  사람)가  과연 네 결혼에 대해 최종적으로 어떤 견해를 가지고 있을지도 모른다는 그런  암시 말이야.”\\n“전혀 없었어.”\\n\\u3000“자, 헨델(주인공의 애칭). 내 영혼과 명예를  걸고  말하건대,  이건 절대 질투심에서 비롯된 말이 아니야! 넌 그녀에게 구속당하는 게 없잖니, 네 자신을 그녀로부터 떼어놓을 순 없겠니? 어때? 내가 말했지, 내가 널 아주 불쾌하게 만들 거라고.”\\n\\u3000나는 고개를 옆으로 돌렸다. 바다에서 불어오던 우리 마을 습지대 바람들처럼, 급속하게 휘몰아치는 어떤 감정이, 안개가 엄숙하게 피어 오르던 어느 날 아침에 내가 대장간(고향)을 떠나던 날, 내가 마을 끝 자락에 있던 ‘손가락 모양의 길 안내문’ 위에 손은 짚었을 당시 나를 엄습했었던 것과 똑같은 어떤 감정이 급속하게 휘몰아쳐 또 다시 내 심장에 엄청난 영향(고통)을  주었다.(ㅠ_ㅠ)(자세한  것은  19장 끝부분 참조 바람. 19장 끝부분의 내용은  “런던으로 상경하기  위해 고향을 떠나올 때 주인공이 울었다”는  내용임)\\n잠깐 동안 우리(주인공과 허버트) 사이에 침묵이 있었다.\\n\\u3000“그렇지? 하지만 친애하는 헨델(주인공의 애칭, 20세).” 마치 우리가 침묵 대신 대화를 계속하고 있었다는 듯이, 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20 세)가  계속 말했다.\\n\\u3000“천성(본성)과 환경이 아주 로맨틱하게 만든 어느 소년의 심장 속에 사랑이 강하게 뿌리를 내려왔기 때문에 매우 심각한 상태가 된 거야. 그녀의 양육을 생각해봐, 그리고 미스 해비샴을 생각해보고. 그녀가 어떤 여자인지를 생각해봐. 지금 난 매정하게 굴고 있어 그리고 넌 나를 증오하고 있고. 그럼에도 이 말만은 해야겠어,  헨델(주인공의  애칭). 너의 사랑은 비참한 결말로 치달을 수 있어.”\\n\\u3000“나도 그리되리라는 것을 알고 있어, 허버트.” 여전히  그에게서 고개  를 돌린 채 내가 말했다. “하지만 나도 그것을 어쩔 수 없어.”\\n“네 자신을 그녀에게서 떼어놓을 순 없다는 말이니?” “그래, 불가능해!”\\n“시도해볼 순 있잖아, 헨델(주인공의 애칭, 별명).” “아니, 도저히 있을 수 없는 일이야!”\\n\\u3000“좋아!” 마치 지금까지 잠을 자고 있었다는 마냥, 허버트가 활기 넘치게 흔들며 일어나더니 벽난로의 불을 휘저으며 말했다. “자, 난 다시 상냥한 아이가 되도록 노력할 테야.”\\n\\u3000그러더니 허버트는 방을 여기저기 걸어 다니며 커튼들의 먼지를 털어 없애고, 의자들을 원래 제자리에 옮겨두고, 아무렇게나 놓여있던 책들 따위를 정리하고, 홀(방) 안을 들여다보고 우편함을 살짝 엿본 후, 출입문을 닫고 벽난로 옆 자신이 원래 앉아 있었던 의자로 되돌아와 앉으며 왼쪽 발을 두 팔로 껴안듯이 들었다.\\n\\u3000“어쩌지, 할 말이 한 두어 가지 더 있는데, 헨델(주인공의 애칭). 이번엔 ‘내 아버지(주인공의 신사교육 개인지도교사인 ’포킷 씨‘를 말함)’와 ‘내 아버지의 아들(허버트 자기 자신)’에 관한 일이야. 내 아버지의 집이 살림살이 면에서 별로 훌륭하지 못하다는 것은, 내 아버지의 아  들이 논할 필요도 거의 없을 정도야. 유감스럽지만.”\\n\\u3000“하지만 모든 게 넉넉하잖아, 허버트(주인공의 친구이름, 20세).” 용기를 불어넣어줄 요량으로 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000(허버트의 긴 대사입니다→) “오오 그렇고말고! 확실히 쓰레기 운반 인조차도 전폭적으로 동의하며 그렇게 말할 정도니까. 그리고 뒷골목에 있는 중고 선박용품 가게에서도 그렇게 말할 정도고. 이젠  좀 진지 하게 말해볼까 헨델(주인공의 애칭, 20세), 이건 충분히 진지한 주제일 테니까. 너도 나만큼이나 우리 집이 형편이 어떤지 잘 알지. 내 아버지   가 상황을 포기하지 않았던 때가 한 번은 있었을 테지. 하지만 그게  이전에 있었다 해도, 시간은 가버리는 거란다. 이런 걸 물어봐도 되니? 네가 예전에 주목할 기회가 있었는지 없었는지를 말이야. 지극히 어울 리지 않는 혼인관계에서 태어난 아이들은 거의 대부분 결혼하고 싶어서 항상 안달이 나 있다는 사실을 아니. 너희 지방에선 어땠니?”\\n\\u3000이건 정말이지 기괴한 질문이었다. 그래서 나는 그에게 이렇게 다시 물었다.\\n“그게 정말이야?”\\n\\u3000“나도 잘은 몰라.” 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20세)가 말했다. “내가 알기 원하는 것도 그것이니까. 우리 형제들의 경우엔 확정적이거든. 내 가엾은 누이 ‘샤를로트(여자이름)’가 인상적인 예지. 그 애는 내 바로  아래 여동생인데 가엾게도 14살이 되기도 전에 하늘나라로 갔단다. 꼬 맹이 ‘제인(11살)’도 마찬가지고.  결혼해서  자리를  잡는  것이  열망인 그 애(제인, 11세)는 자신의 짧은 생애를 가정의 더없는 기쁨에 대한 끊임없는 명상을 하며 보냈다고 네가 생각해도 좋을 정도니까. 제인보다 더 어린 ‘앨릭(‘알렉산더’란 의미임, 애칭임, 22장 참조)‘의 경  우는 또 어떻고. 실내용 어린이옷을 입은 그 애는 벌써 ’큐(런던 남서  부의 한 지구. 유명한(?) ’큐 왕립 식물원‘이 있다고 함. 네이버검색결 과)’에 사는 자기 또래의 알맞은 어느 어린 여자애와 결혼하기로 약혼 까지 해 놓은 상태니까. 실제로도, 우리 모든 형제자매들이 약혼을 한 상태야, 아기(20세인 허버트의 동생 중에는 갓 태어난 아기가 있음)만 빼고 말이야.”\\n“그럼 넌? 너도 야?” 내(주인공, 20세)가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그래, 나도 약혼했어.” 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20세)가 말했다. “하지만 비밀이야.”\\n\\u3000난 내가 약속을 꼭 지키겠다고 녀석에게 말했다. 대신 호의를  베풀어 좀 더 자세히 말해줄 순 없느냐고 간청했다.\\n\\u3000녀석이 내 미약한 사랑에 대해 너무도 분별 있게 그리고 너무도 감성 충만하게 말해주었기 때문에 나도 그의 사랑의 세기에 대해 뭔가 알고  싶어졌기 때문이다.\\n“내가 그녀의 이름을 알아도 돼?” 내가 말했다. “‘클라라(여자이름, 조연, 19세)’야.” 허버트가 말했다. “그녀도  런던에 사니?”\\n\\u3000“응. 어쩌면 내가 이 말을 해야 할 것 같은데.” 허버트가 말했다. 그와 내가 흥미를 일으키는 이 테마(주제)로 본격적으로 발을 들여놓기 시작한 후부터, 녀석은 호기심을 불러일으키게도 풀이 죽고 온순해졌다.\\n녀석이 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그녀는 내 어머니의 엉터리 같은 귀족가문 관념엔 다소 못 미치는 여성이야. 그 애 아버지가 여객수송선에 식료품을 공급하는 일을 했었거든. 내 생각에 그의 지위가 사무장(사무책임자, 선원) 쯤 이셨을 거야.”\\n“지금은 뭐하시는 분이신데?” 내가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“(놀림조로) 지금은 ‘몸이 성치 못해 늘 골골거리며 병을 앓고 사시는 분’이셔.” 허버트가  대답했다.\\n“생활은 어떻게…?” “2층에서.”  허버트가 말했다.\\n\\u3000그것은 내가 기대한 것과는 전혀 다른  답변이었다.  왜냐하면  내가 애초 질문을 던진 의도는 그의 생계수단이 궁금했기 때문이었다.\\n허버트가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“실은 나도 그 분을 뵌 적은 없어. 그가 항상 자기 방에만 틀어박혀 있거든. 내가 클라라(허버트의 약혼자)를  알게  된  이후로도 마찬가지 야. 하지만 그를 끊임없이 엿듣고는 있어. 엄청나게 무시무시한 소동을 일으키시거든. 고함지르고 어떤 끔찍한 도구를 이용해서 방바닥에 말 뚝을 박으시니까.”\\n\\u3000내 눈을 살피며 그가 진심으로 웃었다.  허버트가  잠간동안  평상시 그의 활기찬 태도를  되찾았다.\\n“그를 만나보고 싶은 건 아니고?” 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“오 그렇고말고, 난 항상 그를 만날 기대를 하는 걸.” 허버트가 대답 했다. “그의 고함소리를 들을 때마다 그가 천장을 통과해 공중제비를  돌며 떨어지는 것을 기대하니까. 하지만 보(건물바닥 하중을 기둥으로 옮겨주는 구조물)들이 얼마나 오랫동안 2층 바닥을 잡아 줄지 나는 모르니까.”\\n\\u3000허버트가 다시 한 번 실컷 웃었다. 그러더니 다시 온순한 태도로 돌아왔다. 그가 내게 “자산만 현실화되면 이 젊은 숙녀와 결혼할 생각이 야.”라고 말했다.\\n\\u3000그가 한 마디를 더 덧붙였다. 그건 의기소침함을 불러일으키는 다소 자명한 진술이었다.\\n\\u3000“하지만 넌 결혼할 수 없을 거야. 네가 더 잘 알겠지만, 방황하는 한 넌 그럴 순  없어.”\\n\\u3000우린 함께 벽난로의 불을 응시했다. 나는 생각했다. 때때로 이 같은 자산을 현실화한다는 비전(전망)이 얼마나  어려운지를.\\n나는 두 호주머니에 두 손을 집어넣었다.\\n\\u3000두 호주머니 중 하나에 있던, 접힌 한 장의 ‘종이’가 내 주의를 끌었다.\\n\\u3000종이를 펼쳐보았다. 그건 내가 조(주인공의 매형, 대장장이, 55세, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물)에게서 받았던 연극 광고 안내문이었다.\\n\\u3000명연기로 이름을 떨친 지방의 어느 유명한 아마추어 연기자(웹슬 씨, 주인공 고향의 교회서기였다가 연기자가 되겠다며 런던연극계로 무작정 상경한 코믹한 인물)의 사상 첫 출연작과 관련된 연극 광고 안내문 이었다.\\n\\u3000“어럽쇼!” 내가 본의 아니게 큰 소리로 말했다. “젠장 할, 오늘 밤이잖아!”\\n\\u3000즉시 대화의 주제가 바뀌었다. 우리는 허겁지겁 연극을 보러 가기로 결정했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 나는 모든 실행 가능한 방법들과 실행 불가능한 방법들을 통 틀어서라도 그의 애정에 관한 제반사항에 있어 허버트를 위로하고 돕겠다고 맹세했다.\\n\\u3000그러자 허버트도 내게, 그의

이을 왕자로 정하고 좋은 여자를 맞이해 결혼을 시키려고 하는데 때마침 이때부터 왕궁을 지키던 수비병(햄릿의 친아버지를 존경했었던 병사들)들  눈앞에  ‘죽은  왕(햄릿의 친아버지)’ 이 나타나면서 일이 벌어져 여차여차해서 햄릿도 친어머니와 삼촌의 계략을 알게 되고 이리저리해서 햄릿은 ‘자신을 사랑하던,’ 귀족가문의 ‘딸’을 죽게 만들고 그녀의 오빠와 원수지간이 되어 왕의 만찬장에서 결투를 벌이다 왕위 계승자들(삼촌, 친어머니, 자기 자신)을 모두 죽인 다는 내용입니다. 스스로 목숨을 끊게 만든다는 내용입니다. 〈햄릿〉에서 끔찍한 유령이 나오는 분위기가 이후 전개될 위대한 유산 31장의 이미지와 비슷해 디킨스가 사용했습니다.)(잠깐 앞 뒤 설명 끝)\\n\\u3000\\n(아래부터는 『위대한 유산』 본문임)\\n\\n\\u3000연극이 속행되는 동안 몇 가지 호기심을 끄는 작은 상황들이 연출되 었다.\\n\\u3000‘고인이 되신, 덴마크의 왕(햄릿의 친아버지)’이 사망 당시 기침으로 엄청 고생한 것 같았을 뿐만 아니라, 무덤까지 그 기침을 가지고 간것 갔고 다시 무덤에서 나오실 때에도 그 기침을 가지고 나온 것만 같 았다.\\n\\u3000‘국왕의 환영(유령, 햄릿의 친아버지)’은 자기 곤봉(몽둥이) 둘레에다가 유령 같은(희미한) 원고 한 장을 두르고 나와, 때때로 그 원고를 참조하는 모습을 보였으며 또한 자신의 죽음 상태를 암시하는 대사를 어디까지 읽었는지 종종 까먹는 경향을 보이며 불안한 태도를 보였다.\\n\\u3000이 어설픈 연기 때문에 결국 이 ‘음영의 존재(유령)’는 관객들로부터 “다음 페이지 넘겨봐!”라는 야유까지 듣게 되었다. 내 생각엔 그랬다.\\n\\u3000물론 ‘국왕의 환영(유령)’은 이  권고를  몹시  기분  나쁘게 받아들였다.\\n\\u3000게다가  ‘이 위엄 있는 영혼(유령)’에겐 주목할 만한 것이 있었다. 그건 바로, 그가 오랜 세월 전에 무덤을 떠나 헤아릴 수 없을 정도의 거리를 떠돈 것처럼 매번 등장했음에 비해서, 그가 밀접하게 인접해 있던 벽에서 걸어 나왔다는 것이다. 그것도 연기도 뭐고 간에 누가 보더라도 막 나온 게 티가 나게 말이다.\\n\\u3000대충 돌아가는 상황이 이러하다보니, 두려움의 존재여야 할 환영(유령)이 오히려 비웃음을 사고  있었다.\\n\\u3000‘덴마크의 왕비(햄릿의 친어머니)’는 가슴이 엄청나게 풍만한 여성이었다. 비록 그녀가 뻔뻔스러웠다고 역사적인 평판을 받았다는 것이 정설이지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000관객들은 왕비가 옷 여기저기에 너무 과도한 놋쇠(구리와 아연으로 만든 쇠붙이)를 달았다고  여겼다.\\n\\u3000또한 왕비(= 햄릿의 친어머니 = 남편을 독살한 여인)의 턱은 폭이 넓은 금속 끈으로 그녀의 왕관에 달라붙어 있었다. 마치 그녀 자신이 어마어마한 치통을 앓고 있는 중임을 과시하려는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000그녀의 허리는 또 다른 금속 끈에 둘러싸여 있었다. 그녀의 두 팔도 하나씩 금속 끈에 둘러싸여  있었다.\\n\\u3000그래서 관객들이 그녀를 향해 공공연히 “팀파니(솥을 뒤집어 놓은 모양의 큰북)”라고 놀릴  정도였다.\\n\\u3000거인 같은 조상에게서 물려받은 것 같은 ‘사슴가죽 부츠’를 신은 그 귀족소년의 경우엔 일관성이 없이 무대에 매번  등장하고  있었다.  한 번은 단숨에 유능한 뱃사람이 되었던가 하면, 또 한 번은 단숨에 순회공연을 떠도는 남자배우가 되었던가 하면, 또 한 번은 단숨에 죽은 사람을 위한 무덤을 파는 사람이 되기도 했으며, 또 한 번은 단숨에 목사님이 되고, 또 한 번은 단숨에 궁전(궁궐) 펜싱시합에서 극도로 중요한 심판이 되기도 했다. 왜 그 있잖은가, 자신의 노련한 눈과 좋은 식별력을 근거로 하여 펜싱 시합 자들의 최고의 찌르기를 걸러내는 심판.\\n\\u3000이 때문에 웹슬 씨(연극배우)에 대한 관객들의 인내는 점점 타들어 갔으며 심지어, 승직자로 등장한 배우(웹슬 씨)가 아까와 같은 동일한 배우(웹슬 씨)임을 감지해낸 관객들이, 그 배우(웹슬 씨)가 불쌍하게 죽은 어느 소녀(오필리아)의 장례식 절차를 이행할 것을 거부하는 장 면에서는, 기어이 관객들의 분노가 폭발해 호두 껍데기들을 무대를 향해 집어 던졌던  것이다.\\n\\u3000(↑잠깐 ‘앞’ 단락 앞뒤설명 : 햄릿을 너무 사랑해 정신이 안 좋게 된 어느 소녀(이름이 ‘오필리아’, 귀족의 딸임)가 햄릿과 잠을 잔 후 어느 날 우물에 스스로  몸을  담겨  생을 마감합니다.  이 소녀는 스스로 목숨을 끊었기 때문에 승직 자가 종교절차에 따라 장례식을 치러 주는 것을 거절합니다.)\\n\\u3000최후에, 오필리아는 음악적 광기에 서서히 먹이가 되어갔고, 이윽고 그녀가 새하얀 ‘모슬린(털실로 짠 모직물) 스카프’를 벗어 접은 후 손 수건을 묻었을 때, 관객석 앞줄에 있던 철봉에 기대어 너무나 어설픈 배우들의 연기에 짜증이 나고 못마땅해 하며 오랫동안 화가 나 있던 한 남성이 이렇게 으르렁거리며 말했던 것이다.\\n“자 애기 재우고 저녁이나  먹자!”\\n\\u3000조금도 과장하지 않고 말하건대, 그의 말은 상황과 전혀 어울리지 않았다.\\n\\u3000이러한 모든 사건들의 연속이 익살맞은 효과를 내며 내 불행한 읍내 사람의 목전에 차곡차곡  쌓여갔다.\\n\\u3000우유부단한 햄릿 왕자(웹슬 씨)가 국왕(유령)에게 질문을 할 때나 혹은 의심을 품을 때마다, 관객들이 먼저 대답을 말해 버려 왕자를 도왔다.\\n\\u3000예를 들면, 왕자가 “아, 마음속으로 괴로워하는 것이 더 고귀한가?”라고 질문을 했을 땐, 일부 관객들이 “그렇다.”라며 고함질렀고, 또 일부 관객들은 “아냐.”라며 고래고래 고함을 질러댔다. 또 일부 현명한 관객들은 두 가지 의견을 동시에 피력했는데 이런 식이었다. “동전 던 지자! 앞이냐 뒤냐!”라는 괴상망측한 야유. 이 일로 관객들 사이에 토 론클럽이  크게 일어났다.\\n\\u3000왕자가 “나 같은 자들이 천상과 지상 사이에서 기어다니며 도대체 무엇을 해야 하는가?(복수를 해야 하는가?란 의미)”를 물었을 때에는, 관객들 사이에서 “옳소! 옳소!”라는 시끄러운 고함소리들이 여기저기에 서 울려퍼져 왕자(웹슬 씨)의 심기를 북돋아주었다.\\n\\u3000왕자가 스타킹(긴 양말)을 채 다 올리지 못하고 무대에 나타났을 땐, 관객들 사이에서 “저 배우의 다리가 여위고 핏기가 없이 해쓱한 것”에 관한 열띤 대화가 오고 갔고 “혹 그의 다리가 파리한 이유가 친아버지인 유령을 보고 충격을 받아 생긴 것은 아닌지?”에 대한 열띤 대화가  오고 갔다.\\n\\u3000(디킨스가 관객들이 소란을 피운 이유를 부연 설명한 것입니다. 제가  쓴 것이 아니라 디킨스의 글임→) 관습에 따라 왕자가 스타킹을 채 다 올리지 못한 묘사는, 맨 위를 한 번 깔끔하게 접는 것으로써 마무리되 었는데, 원래대로라면 맨 위 부분을 인두(다리미)로 꾸며 놓았어야했겠지요.\\n\\u3000왕자가 리코더(악기)를 집었을 때에는, 관객들 사이에서 “ 〈 브리타니 아 서곡 〉 (영국의 애국적 노래)이나 한 번 불어보라!”는 빗발치는 요청 이 왕자에게 쏟아졌다. 물론 왕자가 집은 리코더는 관현악단에서 방금 연주되던 검정색의 작은 플루트(부는 악기)와 아주 유사했다. 왕자가 문간(출입구)에서 건네받은 것  같았다.\\n\\u3000( 〈 브리타니아 서곡 〉 의 부연설명 : 영국 사람들이 즐겨 부르는 애국 적\\t노래라고\\t함,\\t유튜브\\t링크\\t: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgd9nYqVz2s&feature=youtu.be , 전체 6분, 15초 후부터 음악 나옴, 검색일자 2014-08-27, 이 기회에 한 번 들어보는

왁자하고 터지는 웃음들이 웹슬 씨에게 쏟아 부어졌음을 나는 몹시 슬퍼하며 덧붙이는 바이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 웹슬 씨의 일생일대의 시련은  ‘교회 부속의  묘지’에서  있었다. 교회 부속의 묘지는 고대 숲 같은 모양새를 하고 있었다. 한쪽에는 교회의 세탁소 같이 생긴 작은 게 하나 있었고, 다른 쪽에는 ‘유료 도 로(마찻길)의 요금을 받는 문’이 하나 있었다.\\n\\u3000폭이 넓은 검정색 망토(소매 없는 외투)를 입은 ‘웹슬 씨’가 유료 마찻길 쪽으로 들어오는 모습이 보였을 때, 관개들이 ‘무덤을 파고 있던 사람’에게 좋은 생각에서 나온 말투로 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“조심하쇼! 당신이 어떻게 일을 하고 있는지 보기 위해 저기 장의사 (웹슬 씨)가 오고  있으니까!”\\n\\u3000생각건대, 두개골(머리뼈)을 두고 도덕적인 말을 들려준 다음에는 꼭 자기 가슴 호주머니에서 꺼낸 흰색 냅킨으로 손가락의 먼지를 털지 않고서는 아마 웹슬 씨(성직자로 연기. 나중에는 햄릿으로 연기)가 그 두 개골을 다시 돌려 줄 수 없다는 것이 입헌국(영국관객들)에 널리 퍼져 있는 통념임에도, 아, 애석하게도(ㅜ_ㅜ), 당연히 해야 할 이 순결하고 ‘필요 불가결한 동작(먼지 털기)’을 웹슬 씨가 했을 때조차도 관객들은 그냥 지나치지 않으려  했다.\\n관객들이 이렇게 지적 질을 했기 때문이다. “웨~이~터냐!”\\n\\u3000매장될 오필리아(햄릿을 너무 사랑해 잠을 잤는데 이후 햄릿이 외면해 미쳐 음악에 심취하다 샘에 비췬 자신의 모습을 보고 빠져 생을 마감한 오필리아)의 시체는 뚜껑이 오른쪽으로 기울어 열린 비워있는 검 정색 상자 안에 있었다. 오필리아 시체의 등장은 곧 관객들에게 “기뻐 하란  신호”로 작용했다.\\n‘이 신호는,’ 관 운반인들 사이에서 식별이 가능한 밉살스러운 한 개인(어설픈 연기도 연기거니와, 시체의 두개골을 만지고도 손수건으로 손가락의 먼지를 터는 관례를 생략해 관객을 불쾌하게 만든 웹슬 씨)이 새삼 목격됨에 따라 ‘아주 강렬하게 작용했음은  두 말할 나위도 없다.’\\n\\u3000또한 그 환희는 ‘오케스트라(관현악단)와 무덤의 끝자리’에서 웹슬 씨(햄릿 연기)가 레어티스(오필리아의 오빠)와 결투를 벌이는 내내 계속되었으며, 웹슬 씨(햄릿 연기)가 식탁 위에 앉아 있던 왕을 찔러 꺼 꾸러뜨릴 때까지도 줄어들지 않았으며, 이윽고 독 칼(펜싱 칼)에 살짝 상처를 입었던 햄릿(웹슬 씨)이 그의 발목에서부터 머리 쪽으로 서서히 죽어갈 때조차도 멈춰지지  않았다.\\n\\u3000( 「 햄릿 」 설명 : 레어티스는 ‘오필리아의 오빠’임. 여동생을 사랑했는데 햄릿 때문에 여동생이 스스로 목숨을 끊자 왕(햄릿의 친아버지를 죽이고 햄릿의 어머니와 결혼한 삼촌)과 계략을 꾸며 만찬장에서 펜싱 시합으로 독 묵은 펜싱 칼을 햄릿에게 찔러 복수하려다 칼이 뒤바꿔 자신이 죽게 되는 인물. 그가 죽자 햄릿이 큰 충격을 받고 왕을 똑같은 칼로 찔러 죽임. 물론 햄릿도 펜싱 시합 때 독이 묵은 펜싱 칼에 살짝 상처를 입어 서서히 의식을 잃다 죽음. 이 모든 사태에 햄릿의 어머니(왕비)도 목숨을 끊음. 셰익스피어의 「 햄릿 」 은 비극임. 하지만 막상 책으로 읽으면 감동이 처음 생각만큼은 아님. 셰익스피어의 비극은 책보단 영화나 연극으로 보는 게 더 좋음)\\n\\u3000우리는(주인공과 허버트) 정말로 웹슬 씨를 위해 박수를 치고 싶었다. 그래서 주위의 눈치를 보고 또 봤다. 하지만 지금 같은 관객들 분위기에선 그를 위해 박수를 친다는 것은 어림 반 푼어치도 없는 일이  었다.\\n\\u3000따라서 우리는 웹슬 씨를 매우 동정하며 앉아있어야만 했다. 그럼에도 불구하고 우리는 입을 크게 벌리고 웃어대고 있었는데, 그건 우리의 의지와는 상관없는 웃음이었다. 뭐랄까 그냥 다 너무나 우스꽝스러 웠다.\\n\\u3000하지만  웹슬 씨의  발성 능력에는 확실히 훌륭한 뭔가가 있었다. 나름 연기에 잠재성이 있다는 인상을 받았다.\\n\\u3000내가 이 얘기를 꺼내는 것은 그와의 옛정을 생각해서 하는 말이 아니다.\\n\\u3000유감스럽게도, 그의 발성 능력에는 아주 느리면서도 매우 황량하며 정력적인 뭔가가 있었다. 삶과 죽음이라는 자연적 환경(죽느냐 사느냐란 대사를 하는 햄릿)에 처한 어떤 남성이 끊임없이 뭔가에 대해 표현했던 것과는 아주 다른 독특한 방식이었다.\\n셰익스피어의 비극은 그렇게 끝이났다.\\n웹슬 씨가 관객들에 의해 불러져 나와 야유를 흠뻑 받았다. 내가 허버트(주인공의 절친,  20세)에게  말했다. “튀자(나가자), 잘못하면 그와 마주칠지 몰라.”\\n\\u3000우리(주인공과 허버트)는 우리가 할 수 있는 최대한 허겁지겁 계단을 내려왔다. 하지만 우리의 걸음이 손살 같지는 못했음이 판명 났다. 왜냐하면 극장 출입구에 짙은 눈썹 자국이 부자연스럽게 나 있는 유대인 한 명이 서 있다 우리가 지나치려 할 때,\\n“핍 씨와 그 친구 분 되시죠?”라고 말했기 때문이다. 그가 내 눈을  보았다.\\n우리가 핍 씨와 그 친구임을 자백할 수밖에 없었다.\\n\\u3000“미스터 ‘월든가버’(웹슬 씨의 예명, 배우용 이름) 씨께서,” 그 남성이 말했다. “두 분을 만나 뵙는 영광을 누리고 싶어 하십니다.”\\n\\u3000“‘월든가버’라고요?” 내가 당황하자 허버트가 내 귀에다 대고 “아마 웹슬 씨를 말하는 건가봐”라고  말했다.\\n\\u3000“오!” 내가 말했다. “그럼요 만나 봬야죠. 당신을 따라가면 되겠습니까?”\\n\\u3000“몇 걸음만 더 가시면 됩니다.” 우리가 옆 복도 안으로 들어갔을 때 그 남성이 고개를 돌리더니 물었다. “그(웹슬 씨)의 옷차림이 오늘 어땠습니까? 제가 옷을 제공했거든요.”\\n\\u3000장례 행렬 때를 제외하고는 웹슬 씨가 그 날 무대에서 무슨 옷을 입었는지  기억나지 않았다.\\n\\u3000그는 파란 리본 옆에 ‘큰 덴마크의 태양인지 별’인지를 추가로 목에 매달고 있었는데 그것이 웹슬 씨를 어떤 특별한 화재 보험 회사 보험에 든 사람 같은 모양새를 갖추게 했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그렇게 말했다가는 결례였음으로 “좋아보였어요.”라고 쿨 하게 대답해주었다.\\n\\u3000“무덤으로 갈 때 말입니다.” 우리의 안내자(웹슬 씨가 고용한 어깨) 가 길안내를 하며 말했다. “그의 망토가 참 아름다워 보이더군요. 하지만 무대 옆쪽에서 봤을 땐, 그가 왕비의 방에서 유령(햄릿의 친아버지이자, 햄릿의 친어머니인 왕비가 독살한 남편)을 볼 때, 그가 스타킹으로 효과를 더 냈을 수도 있었을 텐데 아쉽다는 생각은 들더군요. 제  생각엔 그랬습니다.”\\n\\u3000그의 말에 나도 겸손하게 동의를 표했다. 우리는 협소하고 더러운 반회전문을 통과해, 그 바로 뒤에 있던 뜨거운 팩(포장)을 한 일종의 통  속으로 들어갔다.\\n\\u3000거기에  웹슬 씨가  덴마크 식  의상을 몸에서 때어내고 있었다. 포장용 상자 같은 ‘문’ 혹은 ‘뚜껑’ 같은 그 문을 전부 열어놓고서야, 서로의 어깨들 너머로 웹슬 씨를 쳐다볼 정도의 딱 그 크기의 방이었다.\\n\\u3000“오! 제군들.” 웹슬 씨가 말했다. “이렇게 신사 분들을 접하게 되어 덧없는 영광이네. 특히 핍 씨 자네는 내가 사람을 보내오라고 한 나를 용서해주게나. 자네 같은 신사 분을 이전부터 알아왔다는 것이 이렇게 기쁠 수가 없네. 그리고 연극은 언제나 귀족과 부유한 이들에 대한 권  리가 있으니까. 그들도 언제나 인정해 오는 바였지.”\\n\\u3000그러는 동안에도 미스터 ‘월든가버(웹슬 씨의 예명,  배우용  이름)’ 씨는 햄릿 왕자용 상복(복장)에서 벗어나려고 진땀을 다 빼고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“스타킹을 아래로 내리면서 벗으세요, 미스터 ‘월든가버(웹슬 씨의 예명)’ 씨.” 스타킹의 원소유자가 말했다. “그렇지 않으면 당신이 그걸 부술 테니까요. 70만 원짜리 명품 스타킹입니다. 셰익스피어도 생전에 신어보지 못한 명품 스타킹이란 말입니다. 자, 의자에 잠자코 계세요,     그 일은 제게  맡기시고요.”\\n\\u3000그렇게 말하고서, 그(웹슬 씨가 고용한 어깨)가 웹슬 씨의 무릎으로 가 희생자(웹슬 씨)의 껍질을 벗기기 시작했다. 그 남성이 첫 번째 스타킹을 떼어냈을 때 100% 희생자(웹슬 씨)도 자신의 의자와 함께 발라당 뒤로 넘어갔을 것이다. 하지만 어쨌든 나동 거려지기엔 이 놈의 방안이  너무나 협소했다.\\n\\u3000나는 정말이지 웹슬 씨가 연극에 대해 물어볼까봐 마음이 불안하고 걱정스러웠다.\\n\\u3000바로 그때 우리의 월든가버(웹슬 씨의 예명, 배우용 이름) 씨가 아주 자기 만족스러운 눈빛으로 우리를 올려다보며 말했다.\\n“그래 제군들, 오늘 내 연기 어땠나? 객석에서 보기에 말이네.”\\n\\u3000내 뒤에 서 있던 허버트(주인고의 절친, 20세)가 내 옆구리를 손가락으로 쿡 찌르며  말했다.\\n“훌륭했어요.” 그래서 나도,\\n“훌륭하셨어요.”라고 말했다.\\n\\u3000“등장인물의 개성을 끄집어내는 능력이 어때보였나?” 우리의 월든가버 씨가 생색을 내는 태도와 완전히 다름없는 어조로 말했다.\\n\\u3000이번에도 내 뒤에 서 있던 허버트가 내 옆구리를 손가락으로 쿡 찌   르며 말했다.\\n“중량감  있고 구체적이셨어요.”\\n\\u3000그래서 나도, 마치 내가 그 말을 먼저 하려던 참이었다는 걸 강조하  려는 마냥, 대담하게  말했다.\\n“무게감 있으면서도 실제사실에 입각하신 것 같았어요.” \\n\\u3000“자네들이 그렇게 과찬해주니 기쁘네, 제군들.” 월든가버(웹슬 씨의 예명, 배우용 이름) 씨가 목소리에 위엄을  담아서 말했다. 비록 그때  자기 자신은 벽과 대치한 채 의자의 좌석 옆쪽을 꽉 쥐고 있어야 했지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000“하지만 말씀드릴 게 하나 있는데요, 미스터 월든가버 씨.” 스타킹을 벗겨주고 있던 그 남성(웹슬 씨가 고용한 어깨)이 말했다. “당신이 낭 독하실 때 놓치신 게 있습니다. 귀담아 들어주세요! 이와 반대로 말하는 사람일랑은 전 관심 없으니까요. 제 말은, 당신이 햄릿 대사를 읊으시는 장면에서 두 다리를 옆모습으로 하셨는데 당신이 놓치신 부분입 니다. 제가 옷을 제공한 저번 햄릿 연기자도 리허설(예행연습) 때 그 대사부분에선 똑같은 실수들을 했더랬지요. 제가 그 사람의 양쪽 정강 이(다리부분에서 앞부분에 있는 수직의 긴 뼈) 위에다 ‘착 달라붙는 붉 은색 큰 메모지’를 부착해줄 때까지는 그 사람도 실수를 했습니다. 아마 최종 리허설 때였을 겁니다. 그때 전 무대 바로 앞쪽 아래 부분의 오케스트라석 뒤쪽으로 가서, 그 사람이 두 다리를 옆모습으로 돌리며 대사를 옆을 때마다 이렇게 외쳐주었죠. ‘’메모지가 안 보여요!‘ 결국  그날 밤 정식공연 때 그의 낭독은 훌륭했습니다.”\\n\\u3000미스터 월든가버(웹슬 씨의 예명, 배우용 이름) 씨가 내게 미소를 지 어보였다. 마치 “내 충실한  극단 딸린 식구지. 그가  약간 어리석은  건  난 신경 쓰지 않는다네.”라고 말하려는 듯이 보였다.\\n그러더니 큰 소리로  말했다.\\n\\u3000“연극에 대한 내 관점은 이곳 사람들에겐 좀 고전적이고 진지하게 들린다네. 하지만 그들도 나를 통해 성장해갈  것이네.  암  그러고  말

했다.\\n\\u3000“그러고 보니 그런 남성이 한 명 있었던 것도 같은 생각이 살짝 드 네요.”라고.\\n내가 덧붙였다.\\n“아마 술 먹었겠지요, 확실해요.” \\n\\u3000“오 아니오, 그게 아니오, 선생.” 웹슬 씨가 말했다. “술이 아니오.   그의 고용주가 조치를 취했을 거니까, 술에 취하는 것도 용납지 않았을  게고, 선생.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 아저씨는 그를 고용한 사람을 아신다는 말씀이세요?” 내(20 세)가 말했다.\\n\\u3000웹슬 씨가 눈을 감았다. 그러더니 눈을 번쩍 떴다. 그는 이 두 가지 의식(눈 감은 후 눈 뜨기)을 아주 느릿느릿 실행했다.\\n\\u3000“자네도 눈치 챘을 게 아닌가, 신사양반.” 그가 말했다. “무지하고 뻔뻔스러운 당나귀 같은 놈이지. 귀에 거슬릴 정도로 긁어대는 목에 저급한 원한이 흐르는 안색을 한 놈이지. 그 놈이 덴마크 왕 ‘클라우디 우스’(햄릿의 친아버지를 죽이고 왕비와 결혼한 삼촌. 햄릿의 삼촌)의 배역을 완수한 거요. 방금 눈치 채셨소, 내가 배역이란 말을 프랑스어로 했는데. 나는 또한 그가 연기를 잘해냈다고 인증하려는 게 아니오.  신사 양반, 바로 그 자가 그 남성의 고용주요. 직업이란 그런 것이오!”\\n\\u3000그런 계략에 웹슬 씨가 자포자기하고 있었다면 내가 그를 더 슬퍼했 을는지 아닌지는 명확히 알 수 없었지만, 지금 그대로도 난 그가 너무 처량했고 그래서 웹슬 씨가 멜빵(끈)을 걸치기 위해 몸을 뒤로 돌리는 틈을 이용해서, “집에 모셔서 저녁을 대접하면 안 돼?”라며 허버트의 의견을 물었다. 웹슬 씨가 멜빵을 걸치려고 뒤돌아서는 바람에 허버트와 내가 밀치락달치락하며 반회전문 밖으로 밀려났기 때문이다.\\n허버트도 동의했다. “그게 저분에게도 좋을 것 같아.”\\n\\u3000그래서  우린 정식으로 웹슬 씨를 집으로 초대했다.  그리고 우리 둘은 오는 내내 외투를 눈까지 걸치곤 잠이 든 그를 데리고 우리의 보금 자리인 바너드 여관으로 돌아왔고, 우리가 그에게 대접할 수 있는 한 열심히 그를 대접했다. 그는 새벽 2시까지 앉아서 자신의 연극계 진출 성공을 재평가해보고 앞으로의 구상들을  진척시켰다.\\n\\u3000우리가 나머지 시간을 어떻게 보냈는지는 잘 기억나지 않는다. 하지만 대체적인 내 기억으로는 그는 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“나는 연극을 부할 시키는 것으로 시작할 예정이네. 그리고 결국에 가서는 그것을 으스러뜨리는 것으로 마무리 할 예정이네.”라고.\\n\\u3000그 까닭인즉슨, 그가 죽으면 연극계가 완전히 상실감에 빠져 더 이상의 가망이나 희망을 찾아볼 수 없을 것이기 때문이라고 했다.\\n\\u3000어찌 되었건 나는 잠이 들었다. 우울했다. 에스텔라를 향한 내 마음은 한 마디로 빈약하고 불쌍함 그 자체였다. 나는 내 막대한 유산이  언제 어디서 취소될지 모르는 비참한 꿈을 꾸었다. 나는 또한 허버트의 피앙세(이름이  ‘클라라’)와 결혼식을 올려야하는 꿈을 꾸었으며, 2만 명이 넘는 사람들이 보는 가운데 햄릿에 대해서는 스물(20) 단어도 모르는 체로 유령이 된 미스 해비샴 앞에서 햄릿을 연기해야만 하는 꿈을 꾸었다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 32장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000어느 날이었다. 내가 책들과 포킷 씨(주인공의 신사교육담당 개인교사) 일로  한창 바쁠  때였다. 우체부가 내게 격식을  차리지  않은 편지  한 통을 건네주었다. 편지의  겉봉투를 보는 순간  난 극도의  초조와  흥분 상태로 빠져들었다.\\n\\u3000겉봉투에 적힌 필체는 내가 일전에  본 적이 없는 필체였다. 하지만  나는 그걸 누가 썼는지 직감적으로 알 수 있었다.\\n봉투를  열어봤다. 편지에는 〈친애하는 핍 씨〉 혹은 〈안녕 핍〉\\n혹은 〈 받으시는 분께 〉 혹은 〈 친애하는 아무개 씨 〉 하는 도입부 없이 바로 이렇게 시작되고  있었다.\\n\\u3000〈 런던으로 갈 예정이야. 이틀 후 오후가 될 거고. 런던 도착 ‘정오 마차’편이 될 거야. 마중 나와 줄 거란 약속 잊지 않았지? 무튼 미스 해비샴은 그리 생각하고 있거든. 그리고 나도 그에 맞추어 이 편지를  쓰는 거고. 그녀(미스 해비샴)가 네게 안부 전해 달래~.\\n너의 에스텔라 〉\\n\\u3000그녀의 도착날짜까지 만약 시간이 더 있었다면 나는 아마 이 마중을 위해 정장 몇 벌을 더 주문했었을 텐데. 하지만 시간이 없었기 때문에,  난 지금 가지고 있는 옷들로도 모양을 내기로 기꺼이 감내했다.\\n\\u3000내 식욕은 즉각적으로 사라졌다. 그녀의 도착 때까지 내겐 평온이니 안정이니 하는 것들이 있을 수 없음을 알았다. 물론 그녀의 도착으로  내게 다시 평온이나 안정이 돌아오는 것도 아니었다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 그녀가 도착하는 당일 날 상황은 더 악화되어, 내가  끊임  없이 ‘치프사이드 시티’(런던의 시티 중 하나)의 ‘우드 거리’(런던의 거 리)에 있는 ‘역마차 매표소’를 맴돌기 시작했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그건 그녀를 태운 마차가 우리 읍내에 있는 ‘외설적인 수퇘지’ 여인  숙을 떠나기도 전이었다. 내가 그 사실을 완벽하게 잘 알았음에도 불구하고 난 여전히 “역마차 매표소가 한 번에 5분 이상 내 눈 앞에서 사라지면 안전하지 않을 것 같이 느꼈다.\\n\\u3000이런 이성을 잃은 상태에서 나(20세)는 처음 30분을 망을 보며 보냈다. 물론 그녀의 도착은 앞으로 4시간 또는 5시간은 더 있어야 했다.\\n\\u3000그때 웨믹(42세, 변호사 사무실의 서기 = 사무원, 이름 꼭 외우셔야 합니다. 웨믹은 사무실에서 돈이 나가는 것도 담당하므로 알 수 없는 후원자가 변호사사무실에 맡겨둔 돈을 매달 주인공에게 전해주는 인물 이기도 함)과 우연히  마주쳤다.\\n\\u3000“여보세요, 이거 핍 씨 아니십니까.” 웨믹(42세, 21장 웨믹의 인물묘사 참조. 좀 딱딱해보이고 키가 다소 작고 사각형 턱에 가장자리를 무딘 정으로 뭉갠 것 같은 얼굴의 소유자)이 말했다. “그래 어떻게 지내셨습니까? 설마 이곳이(역마차 매표소) 당신의 순찰 구역은 아닐 테지요?”\\n\\u3000“제가 누굴 좀 기다려야 해서요. 마차 편으로 올 거거든요.”라고 내 (20세)가 설명했다.\\n\\u3000나는 그의 성(성 모양의 오두막집 형태를 하고 있는 웨믹의 집)과 아버님께서는 잘 계신지  물었다.\\n\\u3000“덕분에 모두 무탈하답니다.” 웨믹이 말했다. “특히 연로하신 분(아 버지)께선 더 잘 지내고 계시죠. 원기왕성하십니다. 다음 생일 때 82세가 되시죠. 이번 아버님 생신 땐 대포를 82발 쏠 생각입니다. 물론 이웃에서 민원만 넣지 않는다면요. 그리고 제 꼬맹이 대포가 그렇게 많은 압력을 견딜 수 있는 게 증명이 되면요. 하지만 이게 런던에서 할 이야기는 아니죠. 그래 제가 지금 어딜 가고 있을 것 같으십니까?”\\n\\u3000“사무실로 가시나요?” 내가 말했다. 왜냐하면 그가 사무실 방향으로 향하고  있었기 때문이었다.\\n\\u3000“그건 다음 일이고요.” 웨믹(변호사사무실 서기)이 대답했다. “뉴게 이트  감옥(런던의 유명한 옛날감옥, 1902에 폐쇄됨. 이 소설은 1861년에 쓰인 것임)으로 가고 있습니다. 저희가 바로 지금 ‘은행간부의 소포 꾸러미 소송사건’을 맡고 있거든요. 그래서 사건 현장을 잠깐 보러 내려갔다 오던 참입니다. 그 직접적인 결과로 우리의 의뢰인과 한두 말 정도는  나눠야 해서요.”\\n“그럼 그 의뢰인이 강도질을 벌인 건가요?” 내가 물었다.\\n\\u3000“어이구 천만에요, 그게 아닙니다.” 웨믹이 아주 건조한 어조로 말했다. “하지만 그가 그  일로 고소당한  건 사실이죠. 당신이나  저도 그리될 수 있죠. 우리들 중 어느 쪽은 그 일로 고소까지 당할 수도 있겠고요. 아시잖습니까.”\\n\\u3000“단지 우리 둘 중 어느 쪽도 고소를 당하지 않은 것에, 지나지 않은 거군요.”  내가 논평했다.\\n\\u3000“(상류층 말투로) 그렇습니다!” 웨믹이 자신의 집게손가락으로 내 가 슴부위를 “톡” 치며 말했다. “당신 같은 능구렁이(엉큼한 사람)도 없으실 겁니다, 핍 씨! 뉴게이트 감옥(영국의 유명한 옛 감옥)을 한 번 슬쩍 보시고 싶진 않으십니까? 어떠십니까, 시간이 좀 되시나요?”\\n\\u3000나는 여유시간을 지나치게 많이 가지고 있었다. 그래서 그의 제안(감옥 구경하기)은 내게 다행이었다. 물론 내 내면의 욕망은 역마차 매표 소에서 한시도 눈을 떼서는 안 된다고 반발하고 있었음에도 불구하고 말이다.\\n\\u3000“동행해도 될 만큼의 시간이 있는지를 좀 알아보고 올게요.”라고 구 시렁거리며(중얼거리며) 나는 역마차 사무실 안으로 들어가 직원이 화를 내려고 할 만큼 아주 자세하게 “마차가 도착할 수 있는 가장 빠른 시간”을 확인했다.\\n\\u3000나는 이미 마차 도착 시간을 그 직원만큼이나 자세히 알고 있는 상태였다.\\n\\u3000확인 과정을 거친 후 다시 웨믹 씨에게로 가 내 시계를 참고하는 척 가장하며 내가 역마차 사무소에서 얻은 정보에  놀라는  척  가장하며, 나는 웨믹 씨의 제안(감옥 구경하기)을 받아들였다.\\n\\u3000몇 분 후에 우리는 뉴게이트 감옥에 도착할 수 있었다. 수위실을 통과했다. 수위실에는 몇 개의  족쇄(다리  수갑)들이  횅댕그렁한(벌거벗 은) 벽 위에 걸려 있었다. 족쇄 뒤로는 감옥에서의 준수사항들이란 포 스터가 보였다. 감옥 내부로  들어갔다.\\n\\u3000부풀려진 반발이야 말로 항상 공적인 모든 범법 행위들의 가장 중대 하고 가장 힘든 처벌일 것이다. 하지만  당시까지만  해도  교도소들이 거의 방치된 상태였다. 그리고 공적인 모든 범법 행위들에 대한 결과로 일어나는 부풀려진 반발의 시기는 아직 저편 이야기였다.\\n\\u3000그래서 흉악범들이 병사들보다 더 잘 기거하고(자고) 더 잘 먹는 일은 없었다. 아주 가난한 사람은 말할 것도 없었다.(당시만 해도 흉악범들의 생활이 병사나 가난한 사람들보다 못했다는 이야기. 비슷한 시기에 책을 쓴 마○○스는 영국에서 죄를 짓지 않고 사는 가난한 사람들 이 죄수들이나 병사들보다 훨씬 비참한 생활을 하고 있다고 썼습니다.) 또한 자신들에게 배급된 수프(음식)의  풍미(맛)를 개선하려는 용납될 수 있는 목적으로 교도소에 불을 피우는 일은 좀처럼 찾아 볼 수 없었\\n다.\\n\\u3000웨믹이 나를 데리고 갔을 때가 마침 면회가능 시간이었다. 대폿집(술 집)의 사환(심부름꾼)이 맥주를 든 채 교도소 안  여기저기를 걸어 다니고 있었다. 그리고 교도소 안뜰 철망 뒤로 자유를 빼앗긴 자들이 맥주를 사고 있었고 친구들과 잡담을 나누고 있었다.\\n\\u3000모든 것이 지저분하고 불결했으며 곰팡내 나며 추하고 무질서하고 억압적인 환경 그  자체였다.\\n\\u3000마치 정원사가 식물들 사이로 걸어 다니듯 웨믹(변호사사무실 서기, 42세)이 죄수들 사이를 걸어 다니는 것을 보고 난 충격을 받았다.\\n\\u3000이것이 내 머릿속에 처음으로 들어 온 것은 그가 한 밤 중에 땅을  뚫고 나온 총알 한 방을 쏘아보듯이 죄수에게 말하는 순간이었다.\\n\\u3000“어이, 이거 톰(‘토마스’의 애칭) 대령님이 아니십니까? 거기 계셨군요.  아, 저런!”\\n그리고 또한 웨믹은 다른 죄수에게도 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“물통 뒤에 있는 게 ‘블랙 빌(다시 안 나오는 죄수이름임)’ 아닌가?  이런 근 두(2) 달 동안은 자넬 보지 못했는걸, 그래 오늘 기분은 어때요?”\\n\\u3000그런 식이었다. 웨믹은 철장 앞에 서서 개별적으로 한 사람씩  갈망  하듯 속삭이는 죄수들의 얘기를 귀담아줄 때에도,  웨믹은  움직일  수 없는 상태에 놓인 우체통 같은 표정으로 죄수를 쳐다보고 있었다. 그건 마치 그가 그 죄수를 지난번에 관찰한 이후로 죄수가 이룬 개과천선(잘못을 뉘우치고 착하게 됨)의 양을 주목하고 있는 것만 같았다. 그 래서 죄수의 이번  재판  때  그것이 활짝  꽃 필  때를 기다리고  있는 것 만 같았다.\\n\\u3000웨믹은  뉴게이트 감옥에서 인기가 대단했다. 나는 알아챘다. 웨믹 씨는 재거스 씨(변호사)의 사무 중에서 친숙한 파트를 담당하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000비록 재거스 씨의 상태와 같은 무언가가 웨믹의 주변에도 늘 붙어 다녔고 또한 웨믹이 일정한 선을 넘어서는 친숙함은 용납하지 않았지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000연속적으로 만나는 의뢰인들 개개인에 대한 그의 개인적인 눈도장 (유심히 봄)은 고개를 한 번 까딱하는 것이었다. 그리곤 자신의 모자를 두 손으로 쥐곤 자기 머리 위에 좀 더 편안하게 앉히는 동작과, 그런 다음에 우체통 같은 표정을 더욱더 단단히 하고서 자신의 호주머니 두 개에 두 손을 푹 집어넣는 동작의 연속이 상대방에 대한 그의 개인적인 눈도장이었다.\\n수수료(변호비용) 인상과 관련해 한두 번의 곤란함이 있었다.\\n\\u3000그럴 때면 웨믹 씨(변호사사무소 ‘서기 = 사무원’)는 죄수가 제시한 불충분한 금액에서 가능한 한 멀찍이 뒤로 물러서면서 말했다.\\n\\u3000“당치 않은! 소용없어요 소용없어. 난 단지 하수인(부하직원)일 뿐이 에요. 금전적인 문제는 제가 담당할 사항이 아닙니다. 부하  직원에게  그런 식으로 몰아세우지 마세요. 그리고 수수료를 마련할 수 없다면 본인(재거스 변호사)에게 직접 말하시는 게 낫습니다. 이 바닥에 변호 사는 많습니다. 아시잖아요, 이쪽이 그 수수료 액수를 가당치 않게 여긴다면 저 쪽에선 사건을 맡기에 충분한 수수료 액수로 여길 수 있다는 것을요. ‘종속된 지위에 있는 부하직원에게는 금전적인 부분을 말하  지 말라’가 제가 당신에게 드릴 수 있는 권고(부추김)입니다. 괜히 이것저것 잰다고 시간 낭비하지 마시고요. 그게 저나 당신이나 뭐 다르 겠어요?(←직역 : 왜 당신이 그래야 합니까?) 자, 다음?”\\n\\u3000앞서 말한 바와 같이, 우리는 웨믹(사람이름, 42세)의 온실(뉴게이트 감옥)을 걸어 다녔다. 그때 웨믹이 내게 고개를 돌리며 말했다.\\n“제가 이제부터 악수를 나눌 자를 주목해주세요.”\\n\\u3000그런 귀띔이 없었더라도 나는 그렇게 했어야  했다.  왜냐하면  웨믹 씨는 아직 아무와도 악수를 하지 않았었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그의 말이 있자마자, 당당하고 허리가 똑바른 자세를 한 한 남성이 철장의 한쪽구석으로 다가왔다. 이 글을 쓰는 지금도 그의 모습을 그릴 수 있을 정도로 강한 인상이었다. 그는 일단 많이 입어서  해진 올리브 색(초록색) 프록코트(남성용 긴 코트)를 입고 있었다. 특유의 창백함이 그의 얼굴홍조(붉은 색 안색)를 온통 뒤덮고 있었다. 그의 모자는 표면이 차가워진 수프(음식)마냥 기름이 많이 묻어 있고 표면이 유들유들했다(기름기가 돌았다). 그는 시선을 고정시키려고 애를 쓸 때조차도 사방으로 종잡을 수 없이  움직이는 두  시선을 가지고 있었다.  그가 손을 모자에 붙였다. 반은 진지한 그러면서도 반은 익살맞은(웃기는) 군대식  경례(인사)였다.\\n\\u3000“대령, 당신이 사용하는  이름을 쓰자면 요, 대령!” 웨믹(변호사사무소 서기, 42세)이 말했다. “어떻게 잘 지내셨습니까, 대령님?”\\n“만수무강이오,  웨믹 씨.”\\n\\u3000“처리할 수 있는 모든 것이 처리되었습니다마는, 증거가, 우리 쪽 증 거가 지나치게 강합니다,  대령.”\\n“그렇소, 증거가 너무 강하오, 선생. 하지만  난  신경  쓰지  않소.” “그럼요,  그러시겠죠.”  웨믹이  냉담하게  말했다.  “대령이야  상관도\\n안 하시니까요.”\\n그런 다음 웨믹이 내게로 고개를 돌리더니 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이자는 폐하를 위해 복무하던 자입니다. 복무 중인 군인이었었죠,  사건 발생 후 결국 강제전역 당했지만요.”\\n내가 “정말요?”라고  놀라워하자,  그  자의  시선이  내게  와  꽂혔다. 그런  다음  그  자의  시선이  내  고개  너머를  쳐다보았다.  그런 다음\\n그의 시선이 다시 돌아와 내 주변 여기저기를 떠돌았다. 그런 다음 그    가 손으로 자신의 입술을 “썩” 닦더니 웃었다.\\n\\u3000“내 생각으론 이번 월요일이면 출소할 것 같소, 선생.” 그(대령이었다가 강제전역당한 죄수)가 웨믹(변호사사무소 서기)에게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“아마도요.” 내 친구(웨믹)가 맞장구쳤다. “하지만 어떤 일이 있을지는 알 수  없죠.”\\n\\u3000“웨믹 씨, 당신과 작별을 고할 기회를 가지게 되어 기쁘오.” 그가 두 개의 창살 사이로 손을 내뻗으며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“고맙습니다.” 웨믹이 그와 악수를 나누며 말했다. “당신도 그러시길 바랍니다, 대령.”\\n\\u3000“체포당시 내가 소지하던 게 진짜 화폐로 드러났다면 말이오, 웨믹  씨.” 자신의 손을 도로 거두기를 마음 내키지 않아하며 그 남성이 말했다.\\n\\u3000“당신의 배려에 대한 감사의 뜻으로 당신이 반지를 하나 더 낄 수    있게 장만해주었어야 했는데  말이오.”\\n\\u3000“그 마음만은 받은 걸로 하겠습니다.” 웨믹(변호사사무소 서기, 42세)이 말했다. “그건 그렇고, 대령은 비둘기 기르는 사람이셨다죠. 전문가 수준이었다는데.”\\n그 남성이 하늘을 올려다보았다. 웨믹이  계속 말했다.\\n\\u3000“대령은 공중제비까지 할 줄 아는 놀라운  비둘기들을  기르셨다죠. 당신 친구 아무에게 시켜서 제게 비둘기 한 쌍만 가져다주게 하실 수 있겠는지요, 물론 대령께서 소용이 없는 걸로 한 쌍만 말입니다.”\\n“그리하리다. 선생.”\\n\\u3000“좋습니다.” 웨믹이 말했다. “제가 잘 돌보도록 하지요. 기분 좋은데요, 대령. 그럼 안녕히  계십시오!”\\n그들이 다시 악수를  나누었다.\\n우리가 그에게서 멀리 떨어졌을 때 웨믹이 내게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“화폐 위조자입니다. 아주 솜씨 좋은 작자였죠. 기록관의 보고서가  오늘 제출됩니다. 아마 월요일부로 교수형에 처해질 것이 확실합니다. 그러니까, 어떤 범위 내에선 비둘기 한 쌍 정도는 휴대할 수  있는 재  산이  되는 거죠.”\\n그렇게 말하고는 그가  뒤돌아보았다.\\n\\u3000그 불쌍한 사형수에게 고개를 끄떡여주고 나서 웨믹은 뉴게이트 감옥 안뜰에서 퇴장하는 동안 감옥 여기저기로 시선을 보냈다. 그 행동은 마치 어떤 다른 죄수를 다음 순번으로 아까 그 사형수의 감방 안에 들이면 가장 어울릴지를 이리저리 따져보는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000우리가 수위실을 통해 교도소를 벗어날 때 나는 알아챘다. 내 후견 인(재거스 변호사)의 엄청난 중요성은 교도관들 사이에서도 인정받고 있다는 것을. 물론 그들이 보호하는 죄수들의 경우엔 더 생각할 것도 없었다.(교도관과 죄수 모두 재거스 씨를 인정했다).\\n\\u3000“이거 참, 웨믹 씨.” 간수 한 사람이 말했다. 그는 장식 단추가 달리고 스파이크(뾰족한 징이나 못)가 붙은 수위실 문 2개 사이에 우리를 있게 하고서 다른 쪽 문의 자물쇠를 풀기 전에 방금 연 문의 자물쇠를  주의 깊게 잠그면서  말했다.\\n\\u3000“강가 둔치에서 발생한 살○사건을 재거스 씨(변호사)는 어떻게 처 리하실 생각이시죠? 이번에도 솜씨 좋게 과실 치사로 처리하시겠죠, 그렇지 않으면 그는 이번 사건에 대해 어떻게 대응하실 생각이신지?”\\n\\u3000“왜 그(재거스 변호사)에게 직접 묻지 않는 게요?” 웨믹(변호사사무소 서기, 42세)이  되받아쳤다.\\n“오오, 제가 감히요!” 교도관이  말했다.\\n\\u3000“보시죠, 이게 여기 있는 자들의 행동이죠, 핍 씨(주인공 이름,  20세).” 우체통 입구 같은 입을 길게 늘어뜨리며 웨믹이 고개를 내게로 돌리면서 말했다.\\n\\u3000“저들은 내게 묻는 건은 꺼려하지 않죠. 난 하수인(부하직원)이니까요. 하지만 제 상사(재거스 변호사)에겐 어떤 질문도 던지지 못한 답니 다.”\\n\\u3000“이 젊은 신사 분은 당신 사무소의 연수생이나 수습생(인턴) 중 한 명인가요?” 웨믹 씨의 유머에 교도관이 “씩” 웃어 보이며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“(혼자말로) 또 시작이군, (주인공을 쳐다보며) 이젠 알겠죠!” 웨믹이 호소했다. “(주인공에게) 제가 저렇다고 말하지 않았습니까! 저들은 첫 번째 질문이 채 마르기도 전에 두 번째 질문을 저 같은 하수인에겐 잘도 던져 되죠! (교도관을 쳐다보며) 자, 핍 씨(주인공이름)가 수습생 중 한 명이 맞대면  어쩌시려고요?”\\n\\u3000“그런데,” 교도관이 또 히죽히죽 웃으며 말했다. “그는 재거스 씨가 어떤  분인지 아시나요.”\\n\\u3000“흥!” 느닷없이 웨믹이 익살맞은 몸동작으로 교도관을 비웃으며 소리쳤다.\\n\\u3000“당신은 내 상사(재거스 변호사)와 대면할 때는 그 열쇠들 중 하나 만큼도 말을 못하지. 그걸 당신이 더 잘 알걸. 자 어서 우리나 밖으로 나가게 해주시오, 이 늙은 여우같은 양반아, 그렇지 않았다간 내가 당 신을 불법 감금 혐의로 고소해버릴 테니까, 자 어서 여시오.”\\n\\u3000교도관이 소리 내어 웃더니 우리를 내보내 주었다. 그리고 우리(주인 공과 웨믹 씨)가 계단을 밟고 내려가 거리로 들어섰을 때에도 쪽문의 스파이크(뾰족한 징이나 못) 너머로 우리를 비웃으며 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000“이제 아시겠죠, 핍 씨.” 좀 더 은밀함을 덧보이기 위해 내 팔을 잡으며 웨믹이 진지한 말투로 말했다.\\n\\u3000“전 ‘재거스 씨(변호사)’의 처세 같은 건 모릅니다. 다만 그가 자신을 아주 높게 유지하는 방법은 압니다. 사실 그는 그 방면으로 도가  턴 사람이죠. 그는 항상 아주 높은 곳에 있습니다. 변함없는 그 높이는 헤아릴 수도 없는 그 자신의 변론능력과 같은 종류입니다. 대령(화폐 위조자)이 감히 재거스 씨에게 작별인사를 고하지 못한 것처럼, 저 교도관도 감히 소송과 관련해 재거스 씨에게 묻지 못했습니다. 바로 그때, 저 같은 하수인(부하직원)을 저들과 자기(재거스  변호사)  사이에 몰래 끼어 넣는 거죠. 이제 아시겠죠? 그래서 재거스 씨가 저들의 영혼과 육체까지 소유하게 된 것입니다.”\\n\\u3000나는 아주  강렬한 인상을  받았다. 비록  그것이  처음은 아니었지만,  내 후견인의 사람 다루는 절묘함에 대해서는 혀가 내둘려질 정도였다.\\n\\u3000솔직하게 말하자면, 난 그때 ‘내가 다소  능력이 좀 못한 다른 후견인   을 가졌으면’하고 진심으로  바랬다.\\n\\u3000웨믹 씨와 나는 ‘리틀 브리튼(런던 북서쪽에 있는 거리이름)’에 있는 변호사사무소 앞에서 헤어졌다. 그곳에는 여느 때와 같이 재거스 씨(변 호사)를 한 번 만나기 위해서 새벽부터 꾸물거리고 있는 수많은 탄원 자들을 볼 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 역마차 매표소가 있는 거리로 되돌아와 갔다.  시계를  보았다. 대략 세 시간 정도의 여유시간이 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 시종 내내 뭔가 낯설다는 생각이 들었다. 내가 이 모든 더럽혀지고 얼룩진 교도소와 범죄에 둘러싸여 있어야 한다는 사실이 내겐 너 무도  낯설게 다가왔다.\\n\\u3000즉 내 어린 시절에 어느 겨울 저녁에 홀로 늪지대까지 나아갔다가 내가 처음으로 마주쳐야했었던 것이며, 색이 바랐지만 여전히 지워지지 않는 어떤 얼룩과 같이 시작해 그것이(늪지대로의 여행가서 죄수를 만난 일) 두 번씩이나  재현된  일이며, 그것이 이렇게 새로운 방식으로  내 운과 진보 구석구석에 베어들어야 하는 것이며, 이 모든 게 너무도 낯설게 다가왔다.\\n나는 이런 생각들로 나머지 세 시간을 모두 소비했다.\\n\\u3000내 마음이 이와 같이 골똘해있는 동안에도, 나는 젊음의 아름다움을 지닌 에스텔라를 생각하고 있었다. 거만하고 세련된 여성이 내게 오고 있었다.\\n\\u3000교도소와 그녀 사이에 그어진 이 절대적인 불일치의 혐오를 나는 생 각해보았다.\\n나는 바랬다.\\n\\u3000‘차라리 웨믹을 만나지 않았더라면, 그래서 애초에 뉴게이트 감옥에 들어가지 않았더라면 더 좋았을 텐데. 그가 같이 가자고 권했을 때 처음부터  뿌리쳤어야 했는데.’라고.\\n\\u3000사실이 그랬다. 적어도 이 날만큼은 그런 곳에 가지 말았어야 했다. 일 년 중 그날만큼은, 그녀를 만나는 오늘 만큼은 그런 곳에 가지 말았어야 했다. 지금처럼 내 숨결과 내 옷들에 뉴게이트 감옥의 냄새를  풍길  필요도  없었을 것이다.\\n\\u3000나는 앞으로 뒤로 어슬렁거리며 돌아다녔다. 그래서 내 발에 묻은 교도소의 먼지를 털어냈다. 그리고 내 옷들에서도 먼지를 흔들어 털어 냈다. 나는 숨을 크게 내쉬며 내 허파에서 공기를 내보냈다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 지금 오고 있는데 난 이렇게나 많이 오염되어 있다는 생각이 들었다. 결국 마차가 너무 빨리 오는 것은 아닌지 걱정되었다.\\n\\u3000웨믹 씨(변호사사무소 서기) 씨의 온실(교도소)의 오물에 대한 상념 에서 내가 체 자유롭지 못할 때, 나는 대형 사륜마차(바퀴4개)의 창문 에 비췬 그녀의 얼굴을 보았다. 그녀가 나를 향해 손을 흔들고 있었다. 한 순간, 또 다시, 그녀의 얼굴에서 스쳐 지나갔었던 형언하기 힘든 그 그림자는 무엇이었을까? (주인공은 아직 모릅니다. 하지만 서서히 그녀의 얼굴과 손에서 어떤 특징을 찾아내기 시작합니다. 아직은 ‘그게 누군가와의 닮음을 의미’함을 모르는 상태입니다. 어쨌든 주인공은 시간 간격을 두고 그녀를 마주할 때마다 그녀의 모습에서 불연 듯 스쳐 지나가는 형언하기 힘든 어떤 그림자를 보게 됩니다. 또한 자신이 왜\\n이토록 불안해하는지도 아직은  모릅니다.)\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 33장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000모피로 안을 댄 ‘트래벌링 드레스(잘 구개지지 않는 여행자용 옷)’를 입고 있는 에스텔라의 모습은 이전 어느 때보다 섬세하게 아름다운 것 같았다. 심지어 내 눈에서도  말이다.\\n\\u3000전에 나를 대하며  신경 썼었던 것보다는 더 애교가 있었다. 그리고  나는 생각했다. 에스텔라의 그런 변화에는 미스 해비샴의 영향이 있을 거라고.\\n\\u3000그녀가 내게 자신의 짐을 가리켜 보여주는 동안 줄곧 우리는 여인숙 안뜰에서 서 있었다. 그녀의 짐이  모두 다  모아졌을 때  그제야 떠올렸 다. 내가 그녀의 목적지에 대해 하나도 모르고 있다는 사실을. 그때까지 그녀 외의 모든 것을 망각하고 있었던 것이다.\\n\\u3000“리치먼드(런던 내에서 가장 부유한 동네)로 갈  거야.” 에스테라가 내게 말했다. “수업에 따르면 리치먼드는 ‘서리’(런던 바로 남서쪽 템스 강 부근을 말함)에 하나 ‘요크셔’(런던에서 아주 먼 지방. 영국 가 운데에 위치)에 하나가 있다고 들었어. 내가 말한 건 서리에 있는 리치먼드야. 여기서 거리는 16km고.(16km면 당시 마차로 ‘1시간 거리’입 니다) 마차로 가야하니까 네가 날 에스코트 해줘야 해. 이게 내 지갑이 란다. 거기서 내 여행 경비를 꺼내 지불해주면 돼. 참, 너에게도 지갑이 있었지! 하지만 우리에겐 선택권이 없어, 너와 난 그래, 우리가 받은 지시를 따르면 되니까. 우리 아직 마음대로  행동하기엔  자유롭지 못해, 적어도 너와 난  그래.”\\n\\u3000지갑을 건네주며 그녀가 나를 쳐다보았다 그 동안에도 난 그녀의 말들 속에 어떤 내적인 의미가 있기를 바랐다. 그녀는 그 말들을 경멸하듯 말했지만 사실 불쾌함을 드러낸 것은 아니었다.\\n\\u3000“마차를 부르러 사람을 보내야 할 것 같아, 에스텔라, 잠시 여기에 있을래?”\\n\\u3000“그래, 난 여기서 잠시 머물러야  해, 그리고 차(먹는 차)도  좀 마셔야 하고. 그동안 네가 날 돌봐줘야 해.”\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 내 팔짱을 꼈다, 마치 그 행동(팔짱)도 처음부터 예정되어  있었다는 마냥.\\n“우리를 전용객실로 안내해주시오”라고 나는  웨이터에게  요구했다. 그는 자기 생애에 그런 것을 본 적이 결코 없었던 사람마냥 대형4륜\\n마차를 빤히 쳐다보고 있던 자였다.\\n\\u3000그러자 그 웨이터는 냅킨 하나를 꺼냈는데, 마차 그 냅킨이 위층 계단으로 통하는 길을 자신에게 알려주는 마술의 지팡이인 양 생각하는 것 같았다.\\n그가 우리를 여인숙의 어두운 굴 안으로 이끌었다.\\n\\u3000사물을 줄여서 보여주는 거울 하나가 비치된 방이었다. 그리고 안초 비(멸치)로 만든 소스 양념 통 하나도 비치되어 있었다. 그리고 누군가의 나무 덧신들이 비치되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000방(어두운 굴 같은 방)의 크기를 고려하면 사물을 줄여서 보여주는 거울은 완전히 불필요한  물품이었다.\\n\\u3000이런 은둔지에 대해 내가 반대하고 나서자, 웨이터는 우리를 데리고 다른 방으로 안내했다. 그 방엔 30명은 앉을 저녁 식탁이 하나 놓여 있었다. 방에는 벽난로도 하나 있었다. 그 벽난로 안, 석탄가루 30킬로그램( ㎏ ) 아래로 불에 그슬린 글씨 연습용 책 한 페이지가 있었다. 웨이터가 활동을 멈춘 이 큰 불을 살펴보더니 고개를 흔들었다. 그가 내 주문을 받았다. 하지만 내 주문이 기껏 “이 숙녀 분에게 약간의 차를!”로 판명나자 그는 아주 처진 기분이 되어 방을 나갔다.\\n\\u3000나는 의식하고 있었다. 그건 지금도 마찬가지다. 마구간과 ‘수프스톡 (탕거리)’ 냄새의 강렬한 조합을 이루고 있는 이 방의 공기는, 어쩌면 손님에게 이런 생각이 들게 했을지도 모른다.\\n\\u3000‘마차들이 오고가는 여관 파트의 영업이 신통치 않은가?’ 혹은 ‘기업 심이 왕성한 여관경영자가 여관식당파트에 쓸 요량으로 말들을 바짝 달이고 있는(한약을 ’달이다‘라고 할  때의  ’달이다‘)  것은  아닐까?’라는.\\n\\u3000그럼에도 불구하고 이 곳은 나에게 둘도 없이 소중한 방이었다. 왜냐하면 에스텔라가 그 안에 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000‘그녀와 함께라면 이 곳에서도 평생 행복할 수 있을 텐데.’라고 나는 생각했다.\\n\\u3000당시, 나는 그 점(그녀와 함께하는 삶이 가능한지여부)에 있어서 전혀 행복하지 않았다. 말하건대 나는 그것을 충분히 알고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“리치먼드(런던 내에서 가장 부유한 동네) 어디로 가는데?” 내가 에 스텔라에게 물었다.\\n\\u3000“그곳에서 나는 큰 비용을 대고 어떤 영향력 있는 부인과 지낼 예정이야.” 그녀가 말했다. “그녀 자신이 그렇게 말하는 것일 수도 있지만, 그녀가 나를 이곳저곳 데리고 다니면서 안내해주고 내게 사람들을 소 개시켜 줄 예정이야, 물론 나를 그들에게 소개시켜주기도 하고.”\\n“맞아, 넌 다양성과 감탄을 기뻐할 거야.” “(무관심하게) 응 그럴 거  같아.”\\n그녀가 매주 부주의하게 대답했기 때문에 내가 다음과 같이 말했다. “넌 꼭 네 자신의 일을 남일 같이 말하는구나.”\\n\\u3000“내가 다른 사람들에 대해 어떻게 말하는지를 네가 꼭 어디서 전해 듣기라도 했다는 거니? 자, 자.” 에스텔라가 즐겁게 웃으며 말했다. “내가 너에게서 가르침을 받을 거라곤 기대해선 안 돼. 난 내 방식대로 말한 거니까. 그래 포킷 씨(주인공의 신사교육 담당 개인교사)와는 잘  해나가고 있니?”\\n\\u3000“나는 그 부분에 있어선 아주 만족하며 지내, 적어도….” 내가 혹 기 회를 놓치고 있는 것 같이 여겨졌다.\\n대답은 않고 에스텔라가 갑자기 웃어대기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000이것은 내겐 매우 이상하게 다가왔다. 그래서 상당한 당혹감을 감추지 못하고서 내가 그녀를 바라보았고, 그녀는 활기 없는 웃음이 아니라 진심으로 즐거워서 웃고 있음을 알았다.\\n\\u3000그녀의 웃음이 멈추었을 때 내가 자신 없는 태도로 그녀를 대하며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“만약 그 분들이 내게 어떤 해를 끼친다면 네가 그렇게 유쾌하게 웃진 못할 것 같은데.  아니니?”\\n\\u3000“그래, 그래 그걸 믿어도 좋아.” 에스텔라가 말했다. “그들이 실패하기 때문에 내가 웃는 거라고 믿어도 좋아. 아, 그 사람들이 미스 해비샴을 상대하며 어찌나 추궁을 당하던지 ㅋㅋ!”\\n그녀가  다시 웃었다.\\n\\u3000심지어 지금은 그녀가 웃는 이유를 내게 들려주었음에도 그녀의 그런 웃음은 내게 아주 낯설게 다가오고 있었다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 그녀의 웃음이 진짜임을 내가 의심할 여지가 없었음에도 불구하고 이 경우 그녀의 웃음은 뭔가가 너무나도 이상했다.\\n\\u3000그녀의 웃음에 내가 모르는 뭔가가 더 있을 거라는 확신이 들었고, 그녀가 그런 내 생각을  보았다.\\n그녀가 이렇게 대답했다. \\n\\n(아래는 모두 에스텔라가 주인공에게 하는 대사입니다.)\\n\\n\\u3000“심지어 너조차도, 좌절된 그들의 모습을 보는 것이 내게 얼마나 만 족감을 주는지 알기가  쉽지  않을  걸.  그리고  그들이  우스꽝스러워질 때 내가 그 모습에서 얼마나 큰 대리만족을 느끼는 지도 넌 알기가 쉽지 않을 거야. 왜냐하면 넌 그런 이상한 집에서 갓난아기 때부터 양육 되어본 적이 없을 테니까. 하지만 난 아냐. 동정, 연민, 부드러움과 위로 그 외 비슷한 것들의 복면 아래로, 너에 대한 음모를 꾸밈으로써 네 어린 명민함이 억눌리고 무방비 상태가 되어 본 적이 넌 없을 테니까. 하지만 난 아냐. 한 밤중에 깨어선 그녀 자신에게 마음의  평안을  주는 소지품들을 따져보는 그런 협잡꾼 같은 여자(미스 해비샴)를 발 견하곤 네 어린애 같은 두 둥근 눈이 더 넓게 더 넓게 서서히 떠지는  것을 넌 경험해 본 적이 없어. 하지만 난 그래 봤어.”\\n\\u3000에스텔라는 이제 더 이상 웃고 있지 않았다.  또한  이러한 기억들(겉과 속이 다른 사람들 틈에서 자란 것)을 이제 더 이상 어떤 얕은 곳에서 끄집어내고 있지도  않았다.\\n\\u3000‘모든 유산을 위해서 내가, 그녀에게 그런 표정을 짓게 만드는 원인이 되진 않으리라. 내 비록 그 유산이 산더미 같이 쌓이더라도.’\\n\\u3000“네게(주인공) 들려줄 얘기가 두 가지 있어.”  에스텔라가  말했다.  “왜, 낙숫물이 댓돌을 뚫는다는 속담이 있지.(낙숫물 = 처마 끝에서 떨 어지는 물, 댓돌 = 낙숫물 받는 돌) 물론 넌 그 사람들(주인공의 성공을 질시하는, 미스 해비샴의 먼 친척들)이 네게 해를 끼치진 못할 거란   걸 확신해도 좋아. 크든 작든 언제 어떠한 일에서도 미스 해비샴이 널 지지할 테니까. 그리고 그들의 꾐과 비열함이 무너지는 것에 대한 이  유가 너니까 난 어찌 보면 네게 신세를 지고 있는 거야. 그래서 자 내  손!”\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 장난스럽게 손을 내게로 내밀자 난 그 손을 쥐고 내 입   술로 가져갔다.\\n\\u3000“너 정말 말도 안 되는 바보구나.” 에스텔라가 말했다. “아니면 경고를 전혀 받고 싶지 않은 거니? 그것도 아니면 언젠가(12살 때) 내가 내 볼에 입 맞춰도 좋다고 했을 때의 기분으로 내 손에 키스한 거니?”\\n“그게 어떤 기분인데?” 내가  말했다.\\n“잠깐 생각해봐야겠어. 아첨꾼과 음모자들에 대한 경멸에의 감정?” “내가 ‘그래’ 대답하면, 네 뺨에 다시 키스해도 되니?”\\n\\u3000“넌 내 손에 입 맞추기 전에도 내게 물어 봤어야 했어. 하지만, 그      래,  좋을  대로 해.”\\n내가 웅크렸다. 그녀의 침착한 얼굴이 마치 석고상 같이 느껴졌다. “자.”라고 말하며 에스텔라가 고개를 돌렸다.\\n그 즉시 난 그녀의 볼에 입 맞추었다.\\n\\u3000“이제 내가 차를 좀 마실 수 있도록 배려해주겠니. 그리고 나를 리 치먼드(런던 내에서 가장 부유한 동네)까지 보호해주는 것도 잊지 말고.”라고 말하며 그녀가 원래 말투대로 돌아갔다.\\n\\u3000그건 마치 우리의 유대가 누군가에 의해 강요된 것이며 우린 단지  ‘작은 인형(꼭두각시)’에 지나지 않음을 의미하는 것만 같았다. 그녀의 그런 행동이 내게 고통을 주었다. 사실 우리 교제에 있어서만큼은 모든 것이 내게 너무 고통을 주었다.\\n\\u3000나와 나누는 그녀의 말투가 그 무엇이었든지 간에,  나는 그녀의 말투를 전혀 신뢰할  수 없었다.  그리고 그녀의 말투에 어떠한  희망도  얻 을  수 없었다.\\n\\u3000그런데도 나는 불신과 부질없음에 저항해 계속해서 나아갔다. 왜 수 천 수 만 번이나 그랬냐고? 정말로, 언제나 늘 그것이 신뢰할 수 없고 부질없었기 때문이다.(자신의 행동이 부질없음을 알고 자괴감에 그녀에게 더 다가가려 했다는 말)\\n\\u3000나는 어서 차를 달라고 벨을 울렸다. 그리고 웨이터가 ‘마술의 지팡이(냅킨, 웨이터가 뭔 일을 할 때 먼저 꺼내든다는 의미)’와 함께 다시 나타나, 이 다과(차와 과자)에 곁들여지는 부속물들을 대략 50가지 정도 조금씩 가져왔다.\\n그 50가지 부속물들은 다음과 같다.\\n\\u3000차 쟁반 하나와, 컵들과 받침접시들, 나이프(칼)들과 포크들, 그리고 고기 써는 큰 나이프와 큰 포크들, 각양각색의 스푼들과, 소금 그릇들, 순하게 생긴 작고 둥근 빵(머핀) 하나, 그  빵은  튼튼한 철판 덮개 아래에 조심하고 또 조심해서 가두어져 있었고, 그리고 ‘수북한 파슬리 잎 안’에 ‘부드러운 버터 한 조각’으로 포인트를 준 ‘부들(개울가에 자라는 풀)들 속’에 든 ‘모세(종교지도자)’와, 맨 윗부분에  잘게  빻은 가루를 뿌린 색깔이 연한 빵 한 덩어리, 삼각형 모양의 빵 몇 조각 위에 두(2) 줄 나 있는 부엌벽난로 막대기자국들의 증거, 그리고 최종적으로 뚱뚱 하고 주둥이가 있는 가정용 홍차주전자 하나였다.\\n\\u3000짐이 무거워 고통스럽다는 기색을 얼굴 표정 가득 명백히 드러내며, 웨이터가 이 모든 부속물들을 들고서 비틀거리며 방안으로 들어왔다.\\n하지만 눈결에 언뜻 보아서도 차(먹는 차)는 없었다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 웨이터는 이 접대의 단계에서 오랫동안 돌아오지 않더니, 한참 있다가 어린 가지들이 담겨 있는 값비싸 보이는 작은 상자 하나를  들고서 되돌아왔다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 어린 가지들을 뜨거운 물속에 담갔다. 그런 뒤에 웨이터가 가지고 온 50가지 부속물들 전체를 가지고, 에스텔라를 위해, 뭔지 잘 모르는 것을 한 잔 우려냈다.\\n\\u3000찻값을 지불했다. 웨이터는 팁을 잊지 않고 챙겼다. 마부에게 돈을 지불한 후, 객실 담당 여종업원에게도 적절한 팁을 주었다. 한 마디로, 여인숙에 있는 모든 사람들에게 뇌물을 쥐어주고 멸시와 적개심의 상태에 빠지게 만든 후에야 에스텔라의 지갑은 아주 가벼워졌다.\\n우리는  우편마차를 타고 그곳을\\t떠났다.\\n\\u3000‘치프사이드 시티’(런던의 시티 중 하나)를 돌아 덜거덕거리는 뉴게 이트(감옥) 거리를 지나자, 내가 가장 수치스러워하는 벽들(감옥의 벽 들)이 나왔다.\\n\\u3000“저기(뉴게이트 감옥, 런던의 유명한 감옥, 1902년에 폐쇄됨)가 어디니?” 에스텔라가 내게  물었다.\\n\\u3000나는 바보같이 그것이 무엇인지 한 눈에 알아보지 못하는 척 연기했다. 그런 다음 그녀에게 말해주었다. 그녀가 그곳을  쳐다보고 있다가  이내 고개를 마차 안으로 끌어당기며 중얼거렸다.\\n“불쌍한 사람들!”\\n어떤 일이 있어도 내가 그곳을 방문한 사실을 고백하지 않으리라.\\n\\u3000“재거스 씨(변호사, 주인공의 후견인)는,” 누군가 다른 사람을 솜씨 좋게 언급하며 내가 말했다. “재거스 씨는 저 음침한 곳에 대한 비밀에 있어서는 어떤 다른 런던 시민보다 더 많이 알고 있다는 평판을 받고 있어.”\\n\\u3000(에스텔라의 대사) “그는 모든 장소에 대한 비밀을 죄다 알고 있는      것 같던데, 아니니.” 에스텔라가 낮은 목소리로 말했다.\\n(주인공의 대사)  “그러고  보니  넌  그를  종종  만났겠구나?” (에스텔라의  대사)  “불특정한  간격을  두고  종종  보며  자랐어, 내가\\n기억할 수 있는 어릴 적부터. 하지만  지금은 내가 말을 뗄 때보다 차라리 그를 더 몰라. 그래 넌 그와 교류가 있니? 그가 네 출세를 돕고 있다던데?”\\n\\u3000(주인공의 대사) “일단 의심이 많은 그의 태도에 길들여진 후로부턴 나도 매우 잘 해나가고  있어.”\\n(에스텔라의 대사) “그와  친해?”\\n\\u3000(주인공의 대사) “그의 집에 가서 정찬(저녁식사)을 대접받은 적도 있는걸.”\\n\\u3000“내 생각에,” 에스텔라가 살짝 겁을 내며 말했다. “그의 집은 별난  곳일  것 같아.”\\n(주인공의 대사) “특이한 곳인 건 맞아.” \\n\\u3000아무리 에스텔라와 함께였다지만, 나는 내 후견인(재거스 변호사)을 너무 함부로 논하는 것에 신중했었어야 했다.\\n\\u3000만약 그때 갑작스럽게도 가스 등 불빛이 마차 안으로 쏟아지지 않았다면, 나는 그 주제를 계속 이어가 결국 ‘제라드 거리’(재거스 씨의 집이 있는 거리이름, 당시엔 런던 서쪽에 있던 한적한 거리였음. 지금은  런던 중앙에 위치)에서 있었던 저녁식사자리(‘주인공의 동료’가 ‘주인 공의 라이벌’과 싸울 뻔했는데 재거스 씨가 솜씨 좋게 말린 일, 26장 참조바람)를 묘사하는 데까지 나아갔었을 테지만 갑작스런 불빛으   로 어쨌든 그런 일은 없었다.\\n\\u3000불빛이 지속되는 동안, 이전에 나를 사로잡았던 형용할 수 없는 감정들이 다시 불붙어 살아나는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000그리고 마차가 가스 등 불빛에서 벗어났을 때, 나는 마치 번갯불 속     에 있다 나온 마냥 아찔했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 우린(주인공과 에스텔라, 둘 다 20세) 다른 주제로 대화를 계속했다. 대체로 우리가 여행하는 도로에 대한 얘기들이었다. 그리고 이 방향으로 가면 런던의 어디어디가 나오고 저쪽 방향으로 가면 런던의 어디어디가 나온다는 얘기를  나누었다.\\n“내겐 이 큰 도시가 거의 처음이야.” 그녀가  계속 말했다.\\n\\u3000“프랑스로 건너갈 때까지(그녀 나이 14세 또는 16세 때, 15장 참조바람) 단 한 차례도 미스 해비샴의 품에서 떠난 적이 없었으니까. 프랑스로 출국하거나 귀국할 때에도 런던은 그냥 통과만 했었거든.”\\n\\u3000내가 그녀에게 물었다. “네가 여기서 체류하는 동안 내 후견인(재거스 변호사)이 돌봐주도록 되어 있니?”\\n내 말에 그녀가 단호하게 말했다. \\n“어림도 없는 소리!”\\n그러곤 더 이상 말하지 않았다. \\n\\u3000그녀가 나를 유혹하기 위해 노력했다는 것, 그녀가 그것에 성공하고 있었다는 것, 심지어 그 일(유혹)에 고통이 따랐다고 해도 그녀가 나를 굴복시키고 말았으리란 사실을 내가 외면하기는 거의 불가능했다.\\n그런데도 그것은 나를 조금도 더 행복하게 만들지 못하고 있었다. ‘왜냐하면,’ 비록 우리 사이가 다른 누군가에 의해 결정되었다는 식\\n으론 그녀도 말하지 않았지만 그래도 내 심장을 움켜쥐고 있는 그녀의 존재를 그때 ‘느꼈어야만 했었기  때문이다.’\\n\\u3000‘왜냐하면,’ 내 심장을 짓밟고 내던지기 위해 그녀가 계획적으로 내 심장을 움켜쥐길 원한 것이지 내 심장이 그녀 안에 있는 어떤 유연한 부분(애정)을 억지로라도 끄집어낼 것이었기 때문에 그녀가 그렇게 행동한 것이 아니었음을 내가 그때 ‘느꼈어야만 했었기 때문이다.’\\n\\u3000우리가 ‘해머스미스(런던서쪽 템스 강 옆, 이 당시엔 ’런던 너머‘이고 현재는 ’런던 안‘임, 주인공이 신사교육을 받고 있는 개인교사의 집)’를 통과할 때, 나는 매튜 씨가 사는 집 위치를 알려주었다.\\n\\u3000“그리 멀지 않은 거리니까…, 리치먼드(에스텔라가 살게 된 동네. 런던 내에서 가장 부유한 동네)와 말이야, 그래서 말인데, 내가 널 이따 금씩이라도 볼 수 있기를  희망해(*^-^*).”\\n\\u3000“그래 그렇고말고, 넌 나를 볼 수  있어. 네가  적당하다고 생각될  때는 날 찾아와도 되고. 그 집에 너에 대한 얘기를 할 생각이니까. 사실 대로 말하자면 네 얘기를 벌써 했어.”\\n나는 물었다.\\n“네가 구성원이 될 그 집엔 가족이 많니?”\\n\\u3000“아니, 엄마와 딸 단지 둘 뿐이야. 엄마 쪽은 어떤 지위에 있는 귀부인 출신인데 수입이 증가하는 것에 그다지 기분 나빠하진 않는 것 같 았어.”\\n\\u3000“미스 해비샴이 이렇게 빠른 시간 내에 너와 다시 헤어질 수 있다니 좀 놀랐어.”\\n\\u3000“그건 미스 해비샴이 내게 품고 있는 계획들 중에 일부분이야, 핍(주인공의 이름, 20세).” 에스텔라가 “휘” 한숨을 쉬며 말했다. 피곤해보 였다.\\n그녀가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“나는 그녀에게 끊임없이 편지를 써야하고 정기적으로 그녀를 방문 해야해 그리고 내가 잘 해나가고 있는지에 대해 알려드려야만해. 나와 보석들이…. 왜냐하면 그것들이 이젠 거의 전부 내 소유거든.”\\n\\u3000그건 그녀가 내 이름을 언급한 첫 번째 순간이었다. 물론 그녀는 일  부러 그렇게 했다. 내가 그것을 얼마나 ‘값지게 여길지를(직역 → 소중 하게 간직할지를)’ 그녀가 알았던 것이다.\\n\\u3000우리는 ‘리치먼드(에스텔라가 살게  된  동네.  런던  내에서 가장 부유한 동네)’에 너무도 빨리 도착했다. 우리의 목적지는 동네 중앙에 있는 잔디밭 옆의 집이었다. 근엄하게 생긴 옛날 식 집이었다.\\n\\u3000공판일(판사가 심리하거나 판결하는 날)에 여러 번 나갔을 것 같은  테를 두르고 있는 집, 파우더(분)를 바른 것 같은 집, 헝겊 조각을 댄 것 같은 집, 코트 상의로 멋을 내고 스타킹을 말아 올린 것 같은 집, 각종 주름 장식들과 장검(칼)을 찬 것 같이 근엄하게 생긴 옛날 식 집이었다.\\n\\u3000집 앞에 있는 오래된 몇몇 나무들은, 유행 지난 ‘둥근 고리들과  가발들 그리고 뻣뻣한 치마들 마냥’ 틀에 박혀 있고 부자연스럽게 가지가 쳐져 있었음에도, 여전히 유행에 어울리는 양 버티고 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 죽은 나무들의 긴 행렬에 자기 자신들의 자리를 할당받을 시간이 아득히 먼 것 같지는 않았다. 그들도 곧 목적지에 도착해 먼저 와 있던 동지들처럼 침묵의 길을 걷게 되리라.\\n\\u3000고적한(외로운)  소리와 함께 벨이 울렸다. 아마 그  벨은 이 집안이 잘 나갈 때에는 가족들을 향해 이렇게 외쳐댔을 것이다.\\n\\u3000〈 여기 친환경적인 ‘파딩게일’(옛날에 서양여자들이 허리는 가늘게 치마는 불룩하게 하려고 속에 착용하던 둥근 틀)을 입으신 부인

뛰쳐나왔다.\\n대문간은 곧 에스텔라의 짐들로 가득 찼다. 에스텔라가 미소지으며 내게 손을 내밀었다. “잘가.”라며.\\n그녀 또한 집  안으로  빨려  들어갔다. 나는 여전히 집을 바라보며 서 있었다. 나는 이런 생각이  들었다.\\n‘만약 나도 그녀와 함께 저곳에서 살 수 있다면 얼마나 행복할까.’ 하지만 그녀와 함께라면 내가 결코 행복하지 못할 것임을 그리고 항상 비참해질 것임을 그 누구보다 나는 잘 알고 있었다. \\n\\u3000나는 마차에 올라 ‘해머스미스(런던서쪽 템스 강 옆, 주인공이 신사 교육을 받고 있는 하숙집, 주인공의 방은 바너드 여관에도 하나 더 있음)로 되돌아왔다.\\n\\u3000심한 심적 고통을 느끼며 마차를 타, 더 심한 심적 고통을 느끼며 마차에서 내렸다.\\n\\u3000우리 집 대문에서 보니, ‘제인 포킷’(11세 여자아이이름, 주인공의 스승인 ‘포킷 씨’의 똑똑한 딸, 허버트의 나이차 많이 나는 여동생, 독자들이 이름 알 필요 없음)이 자신의 앳된 꼬마 신사의 에스코트를 받 으며 소규모 파티를 마치고 집으로 되돌아오고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그 꼬마 신사가 비록 플롭슨(포킷 씨 집의 ‘여자보모’이름, 독자들이 이름 알  필요 없음)의 통제를 받는  처지였음에도 불구하고 나는 그 꼬마  신사가 부러웠다.\\n\\u3000포킷 씨(50세. 주인공의 신사교육 담당 개인교사, 허버트의 아버지) 는 강의를 위해 출타중이셨다. 왜냐하면 그가 가정(집)경제에 관한 한 런던에서 최고로 기쁨을 주는 강연자였기 때문이다. 덩달아 아이들과 하인들을 관리하는 능력에 관한 그의 최근 논문들이 그 주제와 관련되어 최고로 우수한 교과서들에도 실리기 되었기 때문에 강연요청이 쇄도한 것이었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 ‘포킷 씨 부인(45세. 독자들이 알 필요가 없는 이름임. 많이 안 나옴)’은 집에 머물러 있었는데 그녀는 곧 사소한 곤란 하나에 처하게 되었다.\\n\\u3000즉 밀러스(여자보모 이름, 33장 #21에 나오는 인물들 모두 독자가  굳이 알  필요 없는 이름들임)가 근위 보병 연대에서 근무하는 어느 친척 한 사람 때문에 무책임하게도 결석을 했기 때문에, 애기를 조용히는 시켜야겠고, 그래서 포킷 씨 부인이 애기에게 바늘통을 가지고 놀게 했는데, 그게 나중에 보니 애기 손에 있던 바늘통에서 너무 많은 바늘들이, 즉 그런 어린 애기 환자가 그것을 강장제(약)로 알고 삼켰거나 혹은 외부적으로 사용했다손 치더라도 건강에 유익하다고 생각되어질 수 있는 것보다 훨씬 많은 수의 바늘들이 바늘통에서 사라진 것이다.\\n\\u3000포킷 씨(50세. 주인공의 신사교육 담당 ‘개인교사’이자 ‘허버트의 아 버지’)는 가정(집)문제에 관한한 가장 훌륭하고 실용적인 충고를 들려 주는 것으로 저명하신 분이셨다. 당연하게도 말이다.\\n\\u3000그리고 그는 사물들에 관한 명확하고 건전한 인식을 지닌 매우 현명한 지성의 소유자로 저명하신 분이시기도 했다. 당연하게도 말이다.\\n\\u3000그래서 나는 심적 고통 속에서, 포킷 씨에게 “제 비밀 좀 들어주십시오.”고 청해볼까 하는 어떤 생각을 가졌었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 바늘을 삼켰을지도 모르는 자신의 애기를 위한 특효약이랍시고 애기를 침대에 눕히는 처방을 한 후 자신은 작위에 관한 책을 계속 읽으며 의자에 앉아 있는 ‘포킷 씨 부인(아내)’의 모습을 내가 우연히 쳐다본 후엔, 글쎄, 아니 차라리 포킷 씨(남편)에게 털어놓지 않는 게 좋겠다는  생각이 들었다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 34장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000나는 점점 내 유산에 익숙해져갔다. 나는 주목하기  시작했다, 유산이  내 자신과 내 주변의 사람들에게 서서히 영향을 미치기 시작했음을.\\n\\u3000내 자신의 성격에 미치는 그들의 영향을 나는 가능한 한 최대한 못본 척 위장하고 있었다. 하지만 그것이 결코 좋은 것이 아님은 나도 잘  알고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 조(주인공의 매형, 55세)에 관해서는 만성적인 거북함(자유롭지 못함)을 느끼는 심적 상태로 살았다. 지난번에 있었던 일(자신을 방문한 조를 깔보고 무시하다 조가 실은 겉으로만 어리숙할 뿐 깊은 삶의 지혜를 지니고 있음을 발견하고 주인공이 자신을 비하한 일)이 마음에 걸리고 또 걸렸기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000비디(주인공이 시골에 있을 때 사귀려던 찰나에 유산을 받고 런던으로 오면서 흐지부지된 착한 아가씨)에 대한 내  도덕심도  결코  기분 좋을 리는 없었다.\\n\\u3000카밀라(포킷 씨의 여동생 25장 참조, 엄청 수다쟁이. 부자이자 자신의 먼 친척인 미스 해비샴의 돈을 탐내곤 미스 해비샴에게 “당신을 걱정 하느라 밤에 종종 잠에서 종종 깰 정도에요.”라는 말을 했었음)처럼,  나도 종종 밤에 깨었다. 그럼 영혼까지 밀려오는 피곤함을 느끼면서 다음과 같은 생각을 하곤  했다.\\n\\u3000‘내가, 미스 해비샴(갑부)을 모르는 채 ,그리고 힘든 대장간에서 조(직업이 대장장이)와의 동업자 관계가 되는 남자다운 만족에서 능력을 발휘하며 자랐더라면, 그럼…, 지금보다 더 행복하고 더 잘 되어있었을 수도 있지 않을까….”\\n\\u3000저녁이면 자주 나는 홀로 앉아 벽난로의 불을 바라보곤 했다.  그럴  때면 이런 생각이  들었다.\\n\\u3000‘결국, ‘우리 집(고향 시골) 부엌의 벽난로  불‘과  ’대장간(주인공이 어릴 적에 일했던 시골 대장간)의 불‘과 같은 열기는 세상 어디에도 없어.”\\n\\u3000그렇지만 에스텔라가 내 심적 불안과 동요와 떼려야 뗄 수 없는 관계를 이루고 있었기 때문에, 나는 진실로 그 심적 불안과 동요의 결과물에서 내 자신의 것이 어디까지인지 명확히 경계를 그을 수 없어 혼돈의 상태에 빠졌었다.\\n\\u3000즉, 내게 유산이 하나도 예정되어 있지 않은 채 그러면서도 에스텔라만을 생각하고 있다면, 내가 훨씬 더 잘 해내나가고 있었을까를 만 족스럽게 판별할 수가  없었다.\\n\\u3000자(이제), 내 지위가 다른 사람들에게 미친 나쁜 영향에 관해서라면, 나는 일말의 곤란함도 겪지 않았다. 비록 그것이 너무 어슴푸레하게였 지만, 난 내 지위가 다른 사람들에게도 유익하게 작용하지 않고 있음으로 알아차렸다.\\n\\u3000무엇보다도, 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20세)에게는 그러했다. 돈을 낭비하는 내 습관들은 그의 공격받기 쉬운 본성을 자신이 감당할 수 없을 정도로까지 지출을 하게 했고, 수수하던 그의 삶을 부패시키고, 평 온하던 그의 일상을 번민과 후회로 요동치게 했다.\\n\\u3000내가 무의식중에, ‘포킷 씨 집안의 여타 다른 사람들’이 좋지 못한 술책(씀씀이)들을 생활화하도록 만든 것에 대해서는 나는 전혀 양심의 가책을 받지 않았다. 그런 천함은 그들 본성의 구부러짐이었으며 내가 그들 본성을 얕은 잠에 그대로 두었더라도 누군가 딴 사람에 의해 그들 본성이 일깨워졌을  테니까.\\n\\u3000하지만 허버트의 경우는 아주 다른 경우였다. 그리고 다음과 같은 생각이 들 때마다 찔리는 듯 한 아픔을 내게 주었다.\\n\\u3000‘가구가 부족해 야윈, 그의 방들’을 그의 경제적인 여건과는 전혀 어울리지 않는 실내 장식용품들로 가득 메우고, 카나리아(종달새와 비슷한 새)가 그려진 양복 조끼를 입은 ‘원수(주인공이 비싼 돈을 주고 부 리지만 거의 아무 것도 안하는 심부름꾼 소년)’에게 그가 마음대로 지시를 내리게 하는 악마 같은 호의를 내가 허버트에게 베풀었던 것을 생각할 때마다 나는 종종 찔리는 듯한 아픔을 겪어야 했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 ‘좁은 감방(부족한 용돈)’을 ‘넓은 감방(풍부한 삶)’으로 만드는 확실한 방법으로써, 나는 이제 많은 빚을 지며 생활하기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000내가 시작하면 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20세) 또한 시작하지 않을 수 밖에 없었으므로, 그도 곧 빚을 지며 생활하기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000스타톱(여자 같은 남자, 주인공의 동료)의 제안이 있고 해서, 우리는 ‘작은 숲의 방울새들’이란 클럽의 일원이 되기 위해 명단(이름)을 제출 했다.\\n\\u3000나는 지금까지도 그 단체(클럽)의 설립목적을 모른다. 만약 “회원들은 2주일에 한 번씩 모여 값비싼 정찬(코스 요리)을 들어야하며 식사 후에는 가능한 한 많이 그들 자신들끼리 말다툼을 벌여야하며, 6명의 웨이터들에게 술을 먹여 계단 위에서 뻗어버리게 만드는 것”이 그 단 체(클럽)의 설립목적이 아니라면  말이다.\\n\\u3000나는 알았다. 이 유쾌한 사교의 목적들은 언제나 잘 달성되었기 때문에 나와 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20세)는 첫 번째 기립 건배 때 다음과 같이 언급해야하는 것을 제외하곤 할 게 하나도 없다는 것을 이해했다.\\n\\u3000“(주인공과 허버트가 한 대사) 제군들, 서로 간에 선의의 감정을 돈독케 하는 이 모임이 ‘작은 숲의 방울새들’의 구성원들 사이에서 언제나 이 잔 같이 흘러넘치길 바라네.”\\n\\u3000방울새들(클럽 구성원들)은 자신들의 돈을 바보 같이 썼다. 우리가 코스 요리를 먹던 호텔은 코벤트 가든(런던 중심부의 지구)에 있었다. 그리고 내가 그 작은 숲(클럽)에 가입하는 영광을 입었을 때 내가 본 첫 번째 방울새는 벤틀리 드러믈(얼굴이 나이에 비해 늙어 보이고 몸이 빌딩처럼 둔하고 무거워 보이는 인물. 주인공의 라이벌)이었다.\\n\\u3000그 당시 벤틀리 드러믈은 자기 소유의 마차를 타고 갈 곳과 마차를 제대로 운전할 줄 몰라 시내 여기저기를 허둥대며 돌아다니면서, 길모 퉁이에 서 있는 ‘코너 표시 말뚝들’에 빈번히 손상을 입히고 있었다.\\n\\u3000이따금씩 그는 마부 석 발판  너머로 머리부터  먼저, 거꾸로 마차에서 솟구쳐 오르기도 했는데, 일찍이 나는 그런 의도치 않은 방식으로 ‘작은 숲(클럽)’의 정문을 향해 그가 내던져지는 것을 보았다. 화로에 석탄을 던져 넣듯이  말이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이 부분의 기술은 내가 조금 선수를 쳐서 말한 것이다. 왜냐하면 이땐 아직 내가 작은 숲의 회원이 아니었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그 모임의 신성한 규율에 의하면 내가 성년이 될 때까지는 회원이될 수 없었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000내가 소유한 자금에 대한 자신이 있었기 때문에, 나는 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20세)의 지출을 기꺼이 내 자신이 떠맡으려고 했다. 하지만 그는 자존심이 뭔지 아는 녀석이었다. 그래서 도저히 그에게 대놓고 그러한 제안을 할 수가  없었다.\\n\\u3000결국 녀석은 점점 다방면에서부터  경제적인  어려움을 겪기 시작했고, 끊임없이 자기 주변을 둘러봐야했다.\\n\\u3000우리가  차츰 깊은  밤의 시간들과 동료들에 빠져 들어갔을 때,  녀석은 아침식사를 할 땐 실의에 빠진 눈을 하고서 자신의 주위를 둘러보다가도, 정오 때쯤이면 좀 더 희망을 가지고서 자신의 주변을 둘러보기 시작해, 저녁을 먹기 위해 집에 돌아왔을 땐 축 늘어져 있는 것을 나는 발견했다.\\n\\u3000저녁 식사 후에는 꽤 또렷하게 먼 거리에서나마 자본을 다시 발견한 것 같다가도, 자정(밤중)이 가까워지면 그 자본을 거의 다 실현한 것 같더니, 새벽 2시쯤이 되면 너무나 깊이 낙심해서는 “있지, 핍, 라이플 총(명중률이 높은 소총)을 하나 사서 미국으로 건너가볼까?”라는 식의 얘기를 꺼냈더랬다. 그러면서 “그 총으로 버팔로(미국들소)들을 잡아서 돈을 벌면 되잖아? 안 그러니?”라며 두루뭉술하게 덧붙이는 것이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 평소에는 ‘해머스미스(런던서쪽 템스 강 옆, 주인공이 신사교육을 받고 있는 개인교사의 집)’에서 머물렀다. 일주일에 대략 반은 있었던 것 같다. 그럴 때면 ‘리치먼드(런던 내에서 가장 부유한 동네, 에스 텔라가 머물고 있는 동네)’가 내 뇌리에서 떠나지 않았다. 이것에 관해 서는 가까운 장래에 따로 떼어 얘기하도록 하겠다.\\n\\u3000내가 해머스미스에 머물 때면 허버트(주인공의 절친)도 해머스미스 (허버트의 부모님 집임)에 자주 찾아오곤 했었다.\\n\\u3000그런 기간 동안 계속 그의 아버지(포킷 씨. 주인공의 신사교육 담당 개인교사)는 아들이 기대하고 있는 좋은 기회가 아직 나타나지 않았다는 일시적인 인지를 이따금씩 하는 것도 같았다.\\n\\u3000하지만 가족들이 고꾸라지듯이 뛰어오르고 있는 이런 전반적인 망가지는 상황 하에서는, 아들이 어딘가에서 목숨이 붙어있는 동안 제 밥 벌이는 하는지 아닌지는 어쨌든 그 자신이 처리해나가야 할 일이었다.\\n\\u3000그럭저럭 하는 동안에 포킷 씨(50세. 허버트의 아버지)의 머리카락들은 점점 회색이 되어갔고, 포킷 씨는 자신이 처한 곤혹스러움들에서 빠져나오려고 자신의 머리카락들을 두 손으로 붙잡곤 자신을 들어 올리려는 시늉을 종종  해댔더랬다.\\n\\u3000포킷 씨 부인은 자신이 발을  얹고 있는  대(발판)를 헛디디고 가족들이 넘어지는 와중에도 주구장창 작위(귀족)에 관한 자신의 애독서를 읽으며 감동에 북받쳐 자신의 손수건을 바닥에 떨어뜨렸고 또 감동에 못 이겨 우리들(그녀의 가족들과 주인공)에게 자신의 조부(그녀의 할아버지. 귀족의 작위를 받을 뻔했다가 행정상의 실수가 있어 귀족의 명부에 오르지 못했다고 그녀와 그녀의 아버지께서 주장하는 인물)에 대해 들려주었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 자신의 어린 자녀들이 자신의 주의를 끌 때는 언제나 자녀들    을 침대 속으로 직행시킴으로써 단단히 버릇을 가르쳤다.\\n\\u3000내 앞 길을 정리하려는 목적에서(이야기를 본격적으로 진행하기 전에) 나는 지금 이때 당시의 내 생활에 대해 개괄적으로 얘기하는  것이다. 그러기 위해 ‘버나드 여관(주인공이 이따금씩 들러 묵고 있는 다 떨어질 것 같은 외관을 한 여관. 허버트의 하숙집)’에서의 우리의 평상시 생활방식과 습관들에 대한 묘사를 한 번 하는 것보다 더 좋은 설명은  없을 것이다.\\n\\u3000우리(주인공과 허버트, 모두 20세)는 우리가 할 수 있는 최대한도로 돈을 써대고 있었다. 그리고 그 돈을 받은 사람들이 우리에게 보상을 하려고 마음먹을 수 있는 최소한도의 것들만을 얻어내고 있었다.\\n\\u3000우리는 항상 곤궁한 사람(가난한 사람)들이나 다름없었다. 우리가 알고 있는 소위 예비신사들이란 우리 동료들의 금전 상태는 죄다 이런 식(빚을 내 과소비를 하면서도 겉으론 멀쩡한 척 함)이었다.\\n\\u3000이들 모두, 물론 나를 포함해서, 이들 사이에는 끊임없이 스스로를 즐기고 있다는 명량한 날조가 있었고, 우리  모두는  우리가  실제로는 전혀 행복하지 않다는 해골 같은 진실을 간직하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000‘우리가 실제 행복하지 않다’고 느끼고 있다는  측면에서  말하자면, 내가 아는 한에는 우리의 경우는 그래도 꽤 평범한 경우에 속했다(아직도 정신 못 차리고 살았다는 얘기).\\n\\u3000매일 아침이면 언제나처럼 부푼 기대를 안고 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20세)는 시내로 나가 자신의 주변을 둘러보기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000나는 종종 캄캄한 안쪽 방(허버트의 방)을 방문하곤 했는데, 그는 그 곳에서 잉크병과, 모자걸이와, 석탄 통과, 끈 상자와, 1년 단위로 나오는 책 한 권과, 그리고 자신의 책상과 의자와 어울려  지내고 있었다. 물론 그 방에는 줄긋기에 쓰이는 자도 하나 있었음을 밝혀두는 바이다.\\n\\u3000자기 주변을 둘러보는 것 예외는 그밖에 다른 무엇인가를 하는 그를 나는 일찍이 본 기억이 없다.\\n\\u3000만약 대영제국의 사람들 모두가 허버트가 하는 것만큼만 충실하게 책임을 맡아서 착수한다면, 우리 모두는 지금쯤 덕치국가를 실현했을 수도 있다.\\n\\u3000하지만 불쌍하게도 녀석은 매일 오후면 정해진 시각에 ‘로이즈 다방 (영국의 해상보험업자의 단체)’으로 가 주인에게 눈도장을 찍고 오는 의식을 준수하는 것 예외는 그 밖에 하는 일이 하나도 없는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000로이즈 다방과 관련해서도 내가 파악한 바로는 녀석이 그 다방에 그 다음 날도 가보더라는 것 말고는 녀석이 하는 일은 전혀 없었다.\\n\\u3000그는 자신의 경우가 매우 심각하며 정말 좋은 기회를 포착해야만 한다고 절실히 느낄 때면, 가장 바쁜 시간에 런던증권거래소로 나가 그 곳에 모인 유력자들 사이로 다소 어두운 시골의 댄스마냥 헤집고 들어갔다가 헤집고 나오곤 했다.\\n\\u3000“왜냐하면,” 허버트가 내게 말했다. 그건 그가 그  특별한  의식(높으신 분들 사이에서 그냥 멍 때리기)들 중 하나를 실행하고 온 날의 저녁식사자리에서였다.\\n\\u3000“좋은 기회란 개인에게 쉽게 오지 않으려 하거든 그래서 개인은 그 곳까지 가야하는 거야, 내가 그 사실을 알기 때문에 오늘 그렇게 해본 거야.”\\n\\u3000만약 우리가 서로에 대해 애정이 덜 가지고 있었다면, 내 생각에 우린 매일 아침마다 서로를 어김없이 미워한다고 말했을 것이다.\\n\\u3000후회가  밀려드는 시간(아침)이면 난 형용할 수 없을  만큼 이 하숙집이 싫었으며, 원수 같은 녀석(주인공이 비싼 돈을 주고 부리고 있는 심부름꾼 소년)이 입고 있는 저 제복 또한 눈에 거슬려 견딜 수가 없을 정도였다.\\n\\u3000‘녀석이 입고 있는 저 제복은 그 어느 때보다 사치스럽고 내 지금  수입에 어울리지 않는 모양새를 하고 있어. 24시간 중 그 어느 때보다도 지금 말이야.’라고.\\n\\u3000우리(주인공과 허버트, 모두 20세)는 점점 더 빚을 졌기 때문에 우리의 아침 식사는 점점 더 공허하고 속이 빈 형태를 띄어갔다.\\n\\u3000그러던 중, 어느 때인가의 아침식사시간에 “〈 보석 장신구와 완전히 관련이 없지 않소. 〉”라며 법적 절차를 밟겠다고 위협하는 한 통의 편 지를 받았다. 꼭 내 고향 지방일간지에나 실릴법한 문구였다. ‘보석 장신구’란  어구 말이다.\\n\\u3000그 편지에 너무 화가 난 나는 생뚱맞게도 원수(심부름꾼 소년)의 파란색 옷깃(목)을 붙잡고서 “야 이 녀석아, 뻔뻔스럽게도 우리가 이딴 롤빵이라도 먹길 원할 거라 감히 생각해!”라며 녀석이 움직일 수 없을 정도로  흔들기까지 했다.\\n\\u3000그 결과 실제로도  녀석이 공중에 붕 떠  있게 되었고, 그 모습이 마치 장화를 신은 큐피드(사랑의 신) 같았다.\\n\\u3000가끔은, 이건 불확실한  가끔을 의미한다, 왜냐하면 그것이 우리 기분에 달려 있었기 때문이다. 어쨌든, 가끔씩 나는 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20세)에게 이렇게 말하곤 했다. 마치 그것이 주목할 만한 발견인 양.\\n“내 친애하는 허버트야, 우린 점점 더 나빠지고 있는 것 같아.”\\n\\u3000“내 친애하는 헨델(주인공의 애칭, 별명)아,” 허버트도 진심에서 우 러나오는 말로 이렇게 대답하곤 했다. “네가 나를 믿는다면, 이상한 우 연의 일치이게도, 넌 방금 내가 하려던 말을 한 거야.”\\n\\u3000“그럼, 허버트,” 그럼 나는 또 다음과 같이 반응하곤 했다. “우리의 문제에 대해 자세히 파헤쳐 봐야하지 않을까?”\\n\\u3000이런 계획에 대한 약속을 잡아두는 것으로 우리는 심대한 만족을 매번 얻곤 했다. 나는 항상 이 약속 잡아두기가 비즈니스라고 생각했고,  나는 항상 이 약속 잡아두기가 문제에 맞다드리는 방법이라 생각했고, 나는 항상 이 약속 잡아두기가 적(빚)의 목을 잡아채는 방법이라 생각 했다.\\n\\u3000물론 내가 아는 한 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20세)도 또한 그렇게 생각하는 듯했다.\\n\\u3000우린(주인공과 허버트, 모두 20세) 저녁식사용으로 꽤 특별한 음식을 주문했다. 물론 평소와 달리 마실 것도 꽤 특별한 와인으로 한 병 주문했다. 이건 모두 우리의 마음을 임시로 공고히 해 기대에 부응하는 선까지 끌어올리기  위함이었다.\\n\\u3000저녁식사가 끝났다. 우린 만년필들을 한 꾸러미 끄집어냈다. 그리고 잉크병도 넉넉한 걸로 준비하고, 필기용지와 압지(잉크로 쓴 글씨가 번 지지 않도록 물기를 빨아들이는 종이)도 근사하게 쭉 펼쳐놓았다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 문구류를 넉넉하게 배열해놓고 있으면 너무너무 편안한 뭔 가가 팍팍 느껴졌기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 나는 빛깔 나는 종이 한 장을 골라 그 종이 위 부분을 가로지르며 깔끔한 필체로 이렇게 제목을 썼더랬다.\\n\\u3000“핍(주인공 이름, 20세) 씨의 부채관련 비망록(제가 쓴 글 → 비망록 이란 ‘잊지 않기 위해 쓴 기록’을 의미함)”라고.\\n\\u3000나는 또한 비망록에 “장소 : 바너드 여관(= 허버트 집 = 런던시내 서쪽), 오늘날짜 : ○○○○-○○-○○”라고 적는 것도 잊지 않았다.\\n\\u3000내가 그렇게 하면, 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20세) 또한 종이 한 장을  집어 들어 그 위에다가 내가 쓴 제목과 비스무리하게 적었더랬다.\\n“허버트 씨의 부채 제반 사정에 관한 비망록”\\n\\u3000그런 다음 우리 각자는 서로의 옆에 어질러진 채로 수북이 쌓여 있는 서류 더미들을 조회하곤 했다. 그 서류뭉치들은 그것들이 도착할 때마다 서랍 속으로 집어던져지거나, 호주머니의 구멍 속에 끼어 닳았 거나, 촛불에 그슬려 반쯤은 타버렸던 것이거나, 수주일 동안 거울에  꽂혀 있었거나, 아니며 그 외의 방법들에 의해 훼손된 서류들이었더랬다.\\n\\u3000만년필이 굴러가는 소리는 우리를 몹시도 기운 나게 하고 우리의 기 분을 상쾌하게 만들었기 때문에, 나는 이따금씩 ‘이 유익한 비즈니스 행위’와 ‘실제 부채를 갚는 행위’를 서로 분간할 수 없을 정도였다. 유 용성이란 측면에서 보자면, 이 둘은 너무나도 흡사했기 때문이다.\\n꽤 오랫동안 써내려간 후, 난 허버트에게 이렇게 묻곤 했다. “어때 잘 돼가?”\\n\\u3000그럼 십중팔구 허버트는 누적되어가고 있는 부채의 총량을 가장 후 회막급 한 눈빛으로 쳐다보며 해결책을 찾고 있었더랬다.\\n\\u3000“계속 늘어나고 있어, 헨델(주인공의 애칭, 별명).” 허버트는 이렇게 말하곤 했더랬다. “내 목숨을 걸고 말하건대, 수치가 계속 늘어나고 있어.”\\n\\u3000“넌 굳세어라 금순이도 모르니 마음 단단히 먹어, 허버트.” 내가 엄청난 부지런함으로 펜을 열심히 움직이며 통렬한 응수를 하곤 했더랬다. “문제를 직시해야해. 네 부채들을 조사하고, 그 놈들을 빤히 쳐다 봄으로써 무안을 주어야해.”\\n\\u3000“그래 알았어, 헨델, 그렇게 해보도록 할께. 그런데 왜 이 수치들이  나를 빤히 쳐다보고 내게 무안을 주는 것 같이만 느껴질까.”\\n\\u3000하지만, 내 단호한 태도는 먹혀들었고, 허버트는 다시 숫치 합계에 열중할  수 있었다.\\n한 동안의 시간이 더 흐른 후 녀석이 다시 한 번 포기하려 했는데, 제(허버트) 딴에는,\\n\\u3000“코브스 씨(의미 없는 이름임) 가게에서 온 계산서가 없는 걸.”라거나,\\n\\u3000“이런 로브스 씨(의미 없는 이름임) 가게에서 온 계산서도 없어.”라거나,\\n\\u3000“젠장 노브스 씨(의미 없는 이름임) 가게에서  온 계산서가 없어.”라며 각 경우에 댈 수 있는 핑계들은 다 찾아내며 부채 합계계산을 중간에 관두려했다.\\n\\u3000“그럼, 허버트, 감으로 그 부분을 메꿔봐. 어림잡아 기입하는 방식 있잖니.”\\n\\u3000“넌 정말 기지가 굉장한 녀석이구나, 완전 꾀돌이야!” 감탄하며 내 친구는 이렇게 말하곤 했다. “정말이지 네 비즈니스적인 감각은 아주 놀라워.”\\n\\u3000나도 역시 내가 기지가 많은 사람이라 생각했다. 이러한 때마다, 일류 비즈니스맨, 그러니까 과단성 있고 에너지가 넘치며 주관이 있고 냉철한 마음씨를 지닌 일류 비즈니스맨이란 평가를 내 스스로에게 내 렸다.\\n\\u3000내가 내 부채 목록을 옮겨 적어야 하는 모든 책임을 완료했을 때, 나는 그 목록들과 계산서들을 비교해가며 부채 목록에 체크 표시를 했다.\\n\\u3000하나의 항목에 체크가 될 때마다 내 자화자찬은 사치스러운 감동의  물결  그 자체였다.\\n\\u3000모든 항목에 체크표시를 마쳤을 때, 나는 내  계산서들을  반듯하게 접어, 계산서들 뒷면 각각에 꼬리표를 붙인 후, 계산서 전부를 대칭적인 꾸러미가 되도록  묶었다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 허버트 앞으로 온 계산서들도 똑같은 방식으로 묶어주었다.\\n이런 나를 보고 그가 얌전하게 말했다.\\n“난 너처럼 행정상의 타고난 재능이 없는 것 같아.”\\n\\u3000그래서 난 내가 녀석을 위해 부채목록정리 작업의 초점을 맞추어준 것  같이 느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000부채목록정리 작업에 있어서,  내  작업스타일에는  빛나는 특징이 하나 더 있었다. 나는 이제부터 그것을 “여유(마진) 남기기”라 부르겠다. 예를 들면 이런 식이었다. 가령 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20세)의 부채 총계가 8,200만원(부연설명 : 원문에 나오는 ‘164파운드 4실링 2펜스’ 는 2014년 우리나라 물가기준으로 계산하면 8,200만 원 정도입니다. 계산에 전혀 근거 없는 거 아시죠? 다만 19세기 영국 돈을 이렇게 계산하면 편합니다)이면 난 이렇게 말하곤 했다. “여유 남겨둬, 1억이라고  적어둬.”\\n\\u3000혹은, 가령 내 자신의 부채총계가 그의 4배라면, 나는 여유를 남기고 한 3억 5천만 원이라고 기입했다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 같은 “여유 남기기” 방식의 현명함에 대해 최고로 높이 평가했었다. 하지만 과거를 되돌아보건대 그것이 값비싼 처방이었음을 받아들이지 않을 수  없다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면, 우리는 즉시 새로운 부채를 지고 그 남은 여유의 전체범 위까지 다 메꿔버렸으며, 때때로는 그 남은 여유가 주는 해방감과 지 불능력이 아직 있다는 감각에 빠져, 또 “다른 여유 남기기”가 필요한  상황 속으로 멀찍이 가 있곤 했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000하지만, 우리 부채총계에 대한 이러한 조사를 하고 나면 차분하고 편안하며 도덕적인 침묵이 찾아왔다. 그것은 내게 우선은 내 자신이 칭찬받을 만하다는 느낌을  주었다.\\n\\u3000‘내 고군분투와 일처리 방식, 그리고 허버트(주인공의 절친, 20세)의 칭찬들’로 마음이 어느 정도 진정이 된 나는 테이블 위에, 문구류들 사이로 대칭적으로 묶어 놓은 ‘그와 나의 계산서 꾸러미들’을 올려놓은 채 그 앞에 앉아 있곤 했더랬다.\\n\\u3000그럼 나는 내가 개인이라기보다는 일종의 은행 같다는 느낌을 받았다.\\n\\u3000우리는 이러한 엄숙한 의식(총부채를 계산)을 치를 때면 바깥쪽 문을 닫았다. 이는 모두 작업도중 방해받지 않기 위해서였다.\\n\\u3000어느 날 저녁, 내가 이러한 평온 상태에 빠져있었을 때, ‘앞서 말한 그 문(바깥쪽 문)’의 틈을 통해 편지 한 통이 들어와 바닥에 “뚝”하고 떨어지는 소리가 우리의 귀에  들렸다.\\n\\u3000“네게 온 편지 같은데, 헨델(주인공의 애칭, 별명).” 허버트가 나가서 그 편지를 들고 돌아오면서 말했다. “아무 문제가 없길 바랄께.”\\n\\u3000이것은 그 편지의 묵직한 검정색 ‘봉랍(영화에서 보면 편지를 봉하고 찍는 도장)’과 테(가장자리)를 넌지시 가리키는 말이었다.\\n\\u3000그 편지에는 ‘트랩 회사로부터.’라는 사인(서명)이 되어 있었다. (부연설명 : 트랩 씨는 “45세, 돈 잘 버는 노총각, 주인공의 고향에서 신사복전문점 운명.” 소설 속 비중이 낮은 조연임)(참고로 주인공의 나이는  정확히 20세임)\\n그 편지의 내용은  간략했다.\\n〈 존경하는 경(귀족이 아닌 사람을 높여 부르는  말)께.\\n\\u3000사람들이 저를 통해 경께 다음과 같은 소식을 전해 달라 부탁했습니다.\\n\\u3000“조 가저리(주인공의 친누나 이름, 47세) 부인께서 월요일 저녁 6시 20분경에 이승을 떠나셨습니다. 발인(관을 묘지로 옮김)이 다음 주 월 요일 오후 3시경에 있을 예정이오니 부디 참석하시어 고인의 마지막을 함께해주시면 감사하겠습니다.”라고요.〉\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 35장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000내 삶의 경로(길)에 무덤이 열렸던 적은 그때가 처음이었다.(나중에도 한 차례 더 죽음을 경험할 기회가 있었다는 의미임). 연약한 내 마음에 무덤이 남긴 갈라진 틈은 놀라웠다.\\n\\u3000우리 집 부엌 난로가 옆 누나의 전용의자에 앉아 있는 누나의 모습이 밤낮으로 내 눈앞에 나타났다.\\n\\u3000누나가 없는 그 장소는 아무리 생각해도 내 마음이 헤아릴 수 없는 어떤 것이었다.\\n\\u3000내가 최근에 누나를 떠올렸었던 적이 좀처럼 아니 전적으로 없었음에도 불구하고, 나는 이제 ‘그녀가 내 쪽으로 거리를 가로질러 건너오고 있다’거나 ‘그녀가 지금 내 방문 앞에서 노크를 하고 있다’는 극도로 이상한 생각들에  사로잡혔다.\\n\\u3000그 전에는 내가 누나와 내 방을 연결해 생각해본 적이 단 한 차례도 없었음에도 불구하고, ‘죽음의 공허함’과 함께 ‘누나의 목소리 혹은 그녀가 고개를 돌리는 것 같은 느낌 혹은 몸짓’에 대한 어떤 끊임없는 연상이 내 방 속에는 있었다. 마치 그녀가 여전히 살아있으며 그리고  종종 그 곳을 다녀간 거 마냥.\\n\\u3000내가 누나에게서 매일 매 맞으며 자랄 운명이었는지 아니었는지간에, 나는 많은 애정을 지니고서 누나를 떠올릴 수는 없었다. 하지만 많은 애정은 존재하지 않더라도 몸에 배일 정도의 후회는 있을 수 있다고 생각한다.\\n\\u3000그런 후회의 영향으로 그리고 아마 좀 더 애정을 가지고서 누나를 떠올리지 못하는 것에 대한 보상의 차원에서, 나는 그녀에게 그런 엄청난 고통을 안겨준 가해자에 대해 격렬한 분노를 느꼈다.\\n\\u3000그때 충분한 증거만 나왔더라도 앙심을 품고 올릭(33세, 사악한 악당)을 최후까지 뒤쫓을 수 있었을 텐데. 범인이  누구든  다른 사람이었 다 하더라도.\\n\\u3000조에게 편지를 썼다. 위로하는 편지였다. 말미에 내가 어떤 일이 있더라도 장례식에 갈 것임을 확신해도 좋다고 말했다.\\n앞에서 언급한 그 기묘한 심리상태에서 나는 나머지 기간을 보냈다. 장례식  당일  날,  나는  아침  일찍  고향으로  내려갔다.  그리고  미리\\n‘외설적인 수퇘지(주인공 시골의 ’여인숙 겸 술집‘이름)에서 내려 대장 간(주인공의 집. 집과 대장간이 붙어 있음)까지 걸어갔다.(← 읍내에서 내려 마을까지 걸어갔다는 얘기. 거리로는 6.4킬로미터. 걸어서 1시간 30분 거리임. 8장 참조)\\n\\u3000화창한 여름 날씨였다. 또 다시 맞는 여름이기도 했다. 계속 걷는 동안 내가 어리고 희망 없던 창조물이었을 때와 누나가 나를 돌봐주지 않던 시간들이 생생하게  떠올랐다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그런 생각들은 간질이(회초리)의 매서움조차 부드럽게 하는 어떤 온화한 음색과 함께  떠올려졌다.\\n\\u3000우선은, 강낭콩들과 클로버(네 잎 클로버)의 숨결만으로도 내 심장에 속삭이는 무언가가 있었기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000‘이 햇살 속을 거니는 누군가가 나를 회상하며  마음이 순화되어  나    에 대한 기억을 좋게 떠올릴 날이 올 거야’라고.\\n\\u3000드디어 우리 집이 보이는 곳까지 도착했다. 그때  내 눈에 트랩(신사 복점 주인)  회사가 장례 집행에 들어갔으며 이미 우리 집을 장악한 것이 보였다.\\n\\u3000우울하게 생긴 우스꽝스러울 정도로 침울한 표정을 지은 두 남성이, 검정색 붕대로 한 번씩 감은 목발 한 짝씩을 과시하듯이 내보이고 있었다. 마치 그 목발이 누군가에겐 어떤 위안을 줄 수 있는 의사소통에의 도구이기나 한 마냥. 그들은 현관에 배치되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000그들 중 한 명은 ‘외설적인 수퇘지(여인숙이자 술집이름이자 마차정 류장이름)’에서 해직된 좌마 기수였다.(좌마 기수 = 말 4마리가 끄는  대형 마차의 앞 쪽 두 말 중 왼쪽 말에 타는 기수) 그는 결혼식을 막 마치고 신혼여행을 떠나던 어느 젊은 커플을 구덩이에 꼴아 박은 장본인이었다. 그때 그가 어찌나 술에 취해 있었던지 커플이 구덩이에 곤 두박질치는데도 그는 말의 목을 양팔로 꽉 껴안고 달렸다.\\n\\u3000집엔 마을의 모든 아이들과 마을의 대다수의 여인들이 모여 있었다. 그들은 연신 감탄하며 이 검은색의 수위들을 바라보고 있었다. 그들의 감탄은 닫힌 창문들과 대장간을 보고도 계속되었다.\\n\\u3000내가 들어가자 두 수위, 앞서 말한 그 좌마 기수가 현관문을 노크해 주었다. 이것은 ‘당신은 지금 비탄으로 너무 많이 기진맥진해 있어 현 관문을 노크할 힘도 없을 것이오.’라는 뜻을 함축하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000문은 다른 쪽에 서 있던 검은색 수위가 열어주었다. 그는 목수였다. 내기에 이긴답시고 거위 두 마리로 한 번에 먹은 적이 있는 사람이었다. 그가 나를 가장 좋은 응접실로 안내했다.\\n\\u3000나는 거기서 제일 좋은 테이블을 제 마음대로 차지하고 있는 트랩 씨(신사복전문점 주인)와 마주쳤다. 그는 모든 ‘덧 판(넓게 펴는 판)’들을 일으켜 세워 놓고는 일종의 검은색의 바자회를 열고 있었다. 그 바자회는 수많은 검정 배지(옷에 핀으로 꽂는 종이 같은 거)들의 도움으로  유지되고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나의 등장과 동시에 그가 막 누군가의 모자에 긴 검정색 천들로 아프리카 추장처럼 모양을 내는 일을 막 끝마치던 참이었다. 그래서 내 모자도 건네받기 위해 그가 손을 내밀었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 나는 모자에 검정색 천을 다는 것에 그만 당황해 그의 행동을 오해하고 말았다. 결국 난 모든 따뜻한 애정을 표시하며  그의 손을 잡고 악수했다.\\n\\u3000가여운 내 ‘조’(55세, 주인공의 매형, 직업이 대장장이, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물임 / 주인공의 나이는 20세)는 약간 바닥이 더 높은 응접실의 끝자락에 떨어져 앉아 있었다. 그는 턱 아래로, 약간 검은 망토(외투)를 커다란 나비매듭으로 얽어 감은 상태였다(꼼짝 못하게 된 상태였다).\\n\\u3000그가 상주(죽은 아내의 남편)이기 때문에 트랩 씨(신사복전문점 주 인)에 의해 그 장소를 배치 받았음이 분명했다.\\n내가 허리를 굽혀 조에게  말했다.\\n“(주인공은 조에게 말을 높이지 않습니다) 조, 어때?” 조가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“핍이구나, 녀석, 넌 알게다. 예전 네 누나가 풍채가 당당한 한 명의 여….”\\n\\u3000그때 그가 내 손을 움켜잡았다. 더 이상 그의 입에서 얘기가 흘러나  오지 않았다.\\n\\u3000비디(23세, 15세 때 주인공을 처음 만남, 잘 될 수도 있었는데 주인공이 런던으로 상경하면서 인연이 되지 못한 사이)는 검은 색 드레스를 입고 있었다. 아주 단정하고 얌전해보였다. 조용히 여기저기를 오가며 사람들에게 큰 도움이 되고 있었다.\\n\\u3000비디에게 이야기를 걸었을 때 아무래도 대화를 계속할 때가 아닌 것 같아 내(20세) 자리로 가 조(55세, 주인공의 매형) 옆에 앉았다.\\n\\u3000그곳에서 나는 ‘우리 집 어느 장소에 시신이…, 그녀가…, 내 누나가 안치되어 있을까?’하고 생각해보기  시작했다.\\n\\u3000응접실 안이 달콤한 케이크 냄새로 꽉 차 눈이 어찔어찔할 때, 나는 가벼운 다과가 차려진 식탁을 두리번거리며 찾았다. 내가 응접실 안 어둠에 익숙해져서야 식탁 하나가 보였다. 하지만 식탁 위에는 조각조각 잘려진 건포도가 든 케이크(장례식이 아니라 결혼식 할 때 먹는 케 이크) 하나가 놓여 있었다. 그리고 조각조각 나누어진 오렌지들, 샌드 위치들, 비스킷들, 그리고 두 개의 식탁용포도주병이 놓여 있었다. 그 식탁용포도주병 두 개는 나도 아주 익숙한 장식품(물품)이었다. 하지만 살아오면서 그것이 사용되는 모습을 나는 단 한 차례도 본 적이 없었  었다. 식탁용 포도주병 하나에는 포트와인(단맛이 나는 포르투갈 산 ‘적’포도주)이 가득 담겨 있었고, 다른 포도주병에는 셰리주(식사 전에 마시는 스페인 산 ‘백’포도주)가 가득 담겨 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그제야 알아채게 되었다. 저 노예근성을 지닌 비굴하고 맹종적인 ‘펌블추크’(68세, 능청스러운 잡곡상. 주인공의 매형인 조의 실제 삼촌)가 검정 망토(외투)에 몇 미터나 됨 직한 검정 띠를 모자에 두른 채 이 식탁에서 있었던 것이다. 그는 자신의 배를 채우면서도 또 한 편으로는 내 시선을 자신에게로 끌기 위해 아부하는 듯한 행동을 만들고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그의 동작이 성공했다. 그가 내게로 건너왔다. 셰리주(스페인산 백포 도주)와 케이크 부스러기들의 냄새를 풍기면서 그가 목소리를 죽이며 말했다.\\n“감히, 친애하는 경(귀족이 아닌 사람을 높여 부르는 말)께?” 그러더니  악수를 했다.\\n\\u3000나는 그때 허블 씨(마차바퀴 제조인)와 허블 씨 부인께서도 와 계신 것을 보게 되었다. 마지막에 이름을 부른 분(허블 씨 부인)께서는 한쪽 구석에 앉아 품위를 지킨 채 너무 놀란 나머지 격한 감정의 발작이 생겨 말을 채 못하시고  계셨다.\\n\\u3000우리 모두는 순서를 지어 상여의 뒤를 따를 예정이었다. 그리고 우리 모두는 트랩 씨(45세, 신사복전문점 주인)에 의해 웃기는 보자기로 한사람씩 묶여지고 있는  중이었다.\\n\\u3000“(허물없는 말투로) 내가 하고 싶은 말은, 핍(주인공의 이름, 20세).”이라며 조(매형, 55세)가 속삭이듯 말했다. 그땐 우리가 응접실에서 트랩 씨(신사복전문점 주인, 45세)가 “관례를 가추다”라고 부르는 것을  한참 하고 있을 때였다. 두 명씩 한조가 되는  정렬이었다.  그  정렬은 마치 무서운 종류의 어떤 댄스를 추기 위해 준비를 하는 마냥 끔찍스 러웠다.\\n그때 조가 내게 속삭인  것이다.\\n\\u3000“(허물없는 말투로) 관을 내가 직접 이고 교회까지 갔다면, 이야. 탁 터놓고 깔 수만 있는 그래서 기꺼이 도움을 주려는 착한 어깨(남자)들만 있었어도 내가 직접 했지, 암. 하지만 그랬다간 이웃들이 천시할 테 니까, 그런 행동을. 그리고 그녀에 대한 예의도 아니고, 사람들은 그렇게  오해할 테니까.”\\n조가 이 말을 막 했을 때 트랩 씨가 “꽥” 소리를 질렀다.\\n\\u3000“자자, 어서요, 호주머니에 찬 손수건 꺼내시라고요, 모두!” 그것은 감정이 가신 상인의 상투적인 어투였다.(←의역  / 직역 → 그것은 우울  한  사무적인 목소리였다.)\\n“자자, 손수건 꺼내시라고요! 그럼 자, 준비 다 된 겁니다!” \\n\\u3000그래서 우리 모두는 호주머니에서  손수건들을  꺼내  얼굴로  가져갔 다. 마치 우리들의 코에서 출혈이 일어나고 있는 마냥.\\n두(2) 사람씩 짝을 이뤄 밖으로 줄지어 나갔다.\\n\\u3000조(매형)와 내가 한 조였고, 비디(옛 친구)와 펌블추크(조의 실제 삼 촌)가 한 조였다. 그리고 허블 씨 부부가 한 조였다.\\n\\u3000내 불쌍한 누이(주인공과 20살차이)의 시신은  부엌문  옆으로 빙  돌  아  운반되어 나왔다.\\n\\u30006명의 운반 인들이, 테두리가 하얗고 소름끼치는 검정색 벨벳(표면에 곱고 짧은 털이 빽빽이 나도록 짠 거) 차양(덮개) 아래로, 감정을 억누르고 눈이 가려져야 한다는 것이 이 운반의식의 포인트였기 때문에, 그 전체가 12개의 사람의 다리를 가진 앞이 안 보이는 괴물이, 두 명의 사육사인 ‘좌마 기수’(4마리가 모는 마차에서, 앞쪽 2마리 중 가는 방향의 왼쪽 말에 탄 기수)와 그 ‘동료’의 지도하에, 발을 질질 끌며 앞이 잘 안 보여 줄을 따라 더듬거리며 걷는 듯이 보였다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이웃들은 이러한 배합들을  몹시  괜찮게  생각하는  분위기였다. 우리가 마을을 통과하는 동안 그들은 넋을 놓고 우리를 바라보고 있었다.\\n\\u3000지역 공동체에서 좀 더 어리고 좀 더 원기 완성한 악동들은 이따금씩 줄에서 황급히 달려 나가 매복해 있다가 유리한 지점에서 다시 행렬 속으로 뛰어 들어오곤  했다.\\n\\u3000이러한 때에 그들 속에서도 좀 더 원기 완성한 녀석은 자기들이 예상했던 어떤 길모퉁이로 우리가 빙 돌아 나타나자마자 흥분된 목소리로 이렇게 고함질렀다.\\n“온다,  온다. 와!”\\n“사람들이 저기 오고  있어!”\\n그러면 우리들은 거의 갈채를  받았다.\\n\\u3000이러한 행렬의 과정 속에서도 나는 펌블추크의  절망적이고  비열한 태도 때문에 아주 화가 났다. 그는 내 뒤를 따라오며, 내 모자에 두른  띠가 흘러내리는 것을 바로 잡아주거나 내 외투의 등을 곱게 펴주려는 섬세한 관심을 표명한답시고 오만 때만 방법들을 다 동원하고 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000내 사고(생각)는 허블 씨(마차 제조인) 부부의 지나친 자긍심 때문에도 보다 깊이 산만해졌는데, 그들은 이런 뛰어난 장례행렬에 구성원들 로써 참여하게 된 것을 과장되게 으스대며 자만해했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그리고 지금은 강 위에 있는 선박들의  돛들이  점점  더 커져가더니 우리 앞에 늪지대(주인공의 마을 인근 늪지대, 교회묘지가 있음)의 경계선이 보다 명확히  보였다.\\n\\u3000우리는 교회 부속의 묘지 안으로 들어섰다. 그곳에는 내가 알지도 못하는 내 부모님의 묘지가 있는 곳이었다. 이 교구(종교행정구역=마을) 의 고인이 되신 ‘피립(주인공 아버지의 성 씨) 필립(주인공 아버지의 이름)’과 ‘조지아나 부인(주인공의 어머니 성함).’\\n\\u3000그리고 그곳에 조용히 내 누이(누나)가 소중히 안치되었다. 종달새들이 지면 위 높다랗게 노래를 부르는 동안, 그리고 가벼운 바람이 ‘구름과 나무들’의 아름다운 그림자들로 흙을 흩뿌리는 동안, 내 누나는 조용히 안치되었다.\\n\\u3000이 모든 의식이 행해지는 동안 명리(이득)에 급급한 펌블추크(68세, 능청스러운 잡곡상인, 주인공이 자신의 사업에 투자하길 원하고 있음) 가 한 행동에 대해서 나는 더 말하고 싶지도 않고 말하지도 않겠다. 단지 그가 한 모든 행동들이 나에게로 향했다는 것만 빼고 말이다.\\n\\u3000게다가 〈 어떻게 인간이 이승으로 아무것도 가져오지 못하며 또 저 승으로 아무것도 가지고 갈 없는지와, 어떻게 우리네 인생이 그림자와 같이 흘러가고 잠시도 한자리에 오래도록 머무르질 않는지 〉를 우리에 게 상기시키는 저 경건한 구절들이 읽혀질 때조차도, 나는 “뜻밖에 막 대한 재산을 유산으로 물려받게 된 어느 젊은 신사(주인공)의 경우엔 보류요”라며 그가 기침을 토하듯 말하는 소리를 들어야했다.\\n우리가  귀가할 때였다.\\n그는 대담하며 뻔뻔스럽게도 내게 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“경의 누이께서도 경이 이렇게 자신의 장례식에 몸소 참석하시여 큰 명예가 되어 드린 걸 아셔야 될 텐데요.”\\n그리고,\\n\\u3000“죽음에 대한 대가로 경의 참석을 누이께서도 타당한 가격이라  여겼을 것입니다, 경.”라는 암시까지 내게 주었다.\\n\\u3000그 후 펌블추크가 남아 있던 셰리주(스페인산 백포도주, 식사 전에 마심)를 몽땅 다 마셨다. 다른 식탁용포도주병에 있던 포트와인(단맛이 나는 포르투갈 산 ‘적’포도주)은 허블 씨(마차바퀴 제조인)가 다 마셨다. 그러더니 두 사람은 마치 죽은 사람들과는 완전히 다른 인종인 양 수다를 떨었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그것이 이러한 경우들(장례식 뒷 풀이)에선 통례임을 이후에야 알았다.\\n\\u3000마침내, 펌블추크가 자신의 마차에 허블 씨 부부를  태우고 도망쳤다.  그 날의 피날레(마지막)를 장식하기 위해서였을 것으로 확신한다. 아마 ‘세 명의 쾌활한 바지선 선원들(술집이름)’에 들러 “핍 경이 누리는 저 부의 애초 설계자가 누군지 아는가? 바로 날세. 암. 핍 경이 어릴 적 가장 친애하던 든든한 버팀목이 누군지 아는가? 바로 날세, 암.”이라며 말했을 것이다.\\n\\u3000그들이 모두 가고 났을 때였다. 그리고 트랩 씨와 그의  하수인들도  모두 물러…, 그러고 보니 트랩 씨가  늘 부리고 다니던 ‘점원  녀석’(일  대 최악의 뻔뻔스러운 꼴통, 19세)은 이날 보이지 않았다.(주인공이 트랩 씨에게 점원 녀석의 행동에 대한 악의적인 편지를 물론 우회적인 표현을 쓴 편지를 트랩 씨에게 보냈고 트랩 씨가 점원을 해고한 경우임) 오늘 장례식에서 녀석을 볼 거라 생각했었는데.\\n\\u3000여하튼 모두가 가버리고 트랩 씨와 그 하수인들도 자신들의 허례허 식(거짓꾸밈)을 가방들 속에 “꽉 꽉” 채우고 역시 가버렸을 때서야, 그제야 집이 좀 사는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000이내(머지않아), 비디(옛 여자친구)와 조(주인공의 매형) 그리고 내가 식탁에서 함께 식은 음식들(주로 식은 고기와 함께 먹는 식사를 말함)로  식사를 했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 우리는 낡은 부엌이 아니라 응접실 가장 좋은 자리에서 저녁 식사를 했다.\\n\\u3000조(매형)는 나이프(칼)와 포크 그리고 소금 그릇과  그  외 식기들을 다룰 때 몹시도 신경을 썼다. 그래서 분위기가 대단히 경직되었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 저녁식사 후, 내가 그에게 파이프담배를  건넸을 때, 그리고  내가 그와 함께 대장간 주변을 어슬렁거릴 때, 그리고 우리가 함께 대장간 바깥쪽에 놓인 큰 석재(돌)  위에 걸터앉았을 때, 우리의 관계는  다시 좋아졌다.\\n\\u3000나는 장례식 끝난 후 지금까지 그가 옷을 바꿔 입었다는 것을 알아  챘다. 그것은 ‘그가 일요일 예배 갈 때 입는 복장’이랑 ‘대장간 작업복’ 사이의 어느 타협점이었다. 그 옷을 입자 조가 한층 자연스러워보였다. 본래 그대로의 그의  모습이었다.\\n\\u3000내가 내 조그만 한 다락방(어린 시절 머물던 방)에서 자도 되냐고 물었을 때 조(주인공의 매형)는 아주 기뻐했다. 그리고 나도 역시 기뻤다. 왜냐하면 그런 부탁을 하면서 내가 꽤 큰일을 이룬 것처럼 느껴졌기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000저녁의 그림자가 서서히 몰려올 때쯤, 나(정확하게 20세)는 비디(23세, 15세 때 주인공을 처음 만난 여자조연. 주인공이 런던으로 신사교 육을 받으러 가면서 인연이 되진 못함)와  정원에 들러 짧은 대화를 나눌  기회를 가졌다.\\n\\u3000“비디.” 내가 말했다. “내 생각엔 네가 이 안타까운 사연들에 대해 내게 편지로라도 알려줬어야 했다고  봐.”\\n\\u3000“당신이라면…, 핍 씨?” 비디가 말했다. “만약 내가 그것이 타당하다고 생각했다면 그렇게 했을 거야.”\\n\\u3000“내가 박정하다고(쌀쌀맞다고) 생각하는 건 아니겠지, 비디. 난 네가 그렇게 생각했어야 했다는 걸 말하고 있는 거니까.”\\n“그러신가요, 핍 씨?” \\n\\u3000비디(23세, 옛 여친)는 아주 침착했다. 그녀 주변에는 정돈되고 선량 하며 귀여운 분위기가 있었다. 그래서 그녀를 다시 울리게 만들 생각이 나지 않았다.\\n\\u3000내 옆에서 걸으며 풀이  죽어 눈을 내리깔고 있는 그녀의 모습을 잠시 본 후엔, 나는 그 문제를 되풀이하는 것을 완전히 포기했다.\\n“(약간  장난기로)  이제  여기서  머물기  어려워지겠지요,  비디  양?” “오! 제가 그럴 순 없지요, 핍 씨.” 비디가 슬프고 안타까워하는 말\\n투로 하지만 여전히 차분하면서도 침착한 어조로 말했다.\\n\\u3000“허블 씨 부인(마차 제조인의 부인)과 얘기가 오고 가고 있는 중이야. 내일 그녀에게 가보기로 되어 있고. 허블 씨 부인과 내가 ‘가저리 씨’(55세, 대장장이, 주인공의 매형)가 자리를 잡으실 때까진 돌봐드릴  순 있을 거야, 그러길  바래.”\\n\\u3000 “넌 이제부터 어떻게 살아갈 생각이니, 비디? 만약 네가 돈이 좀 필요….”\\n\\u3000“내가 어떻게 살아갈 생각이냐고?” 비디가 갑자기 말참견을 하며 끼어들었다. 그녀의 얼굴 위로 수간 붉게 빛이 지나갔다.\\n\\u3000“자 말해줄게, 핍 씨. 나는 거의 완성된 인근 새 학교 여교사(비디는 원래 야간학교 선생님이었음) 자리를 얻으려고 노력해볼 생각이야. 여기 이웃 분들이 날 추천해줄 테니까 아주 불가능한 얘기는 아니야.  그리고 부지런히 일하고 참을성 있게 행동해서 내가 아이들을 가르치는  동안 나도 배울 수 있을 거고. 알잖니, 핍 씨.”\\n그녀가  눈을  들어  내  얼굴을  보며  미소지어며  말을  이어갔다. “새로운  학교들은  예전이랑은  많이  다르지만(선생님은  잘 가르치고\\n아이들은 배우려하지만), 그때 이후로 난 너에게서 많은 걸 배웠으니    까. 그때 이후로 줄곧 내 자신을 향상시킬 시간을 가져왔는걸.”\\n\\u3000“내 생각에 넌 언제까지나 스스로를 향상시킬 거라고 봐, 비디(여자 이름), 어떤 환경 아래에서도  말이야.”\\n\\u3000“아! 인간본성의 내 나쁜 측면은 예외겠구나.”라며 비디가 조용하게 작은 소리로 말했다. (부연설명 : ‘비디가 이 말을 한 이유’ → 주인공과 비디가 잘 되려던 찰나에 주인공이 유산을 상속받을 예정인 것이 알려지고 런던으로 신사교육을 받으러 떠나게 되면서 둘의 사이가 서먹서먹해지려던 찰나에 런던으로 가기 바로 전날 주인공이 “매형을 공 부시켜줘. 내가 나중에 유산을 물러받으면 그에게도 기회를 줄 수 있을 거야.”란 말을 했다가 비디가 그는 이미 자기 자신의 직업에 만족한 사람이라며 가르침은 필요 없다는 식의 말을 주고받다가 감정이 안 좋아져 주인공이 화를 내며 “넌 그래서 탈이야, 이건 인간 본성의 나쁜 측면이야.”라고 말을 했는데, 비디가 지금 그때 주인공이 한 말을 코믹하게  되받아친 거임)\\n\\u3000그것은 부지불식간에(저항할 수도 없이) 생각하는 바를  그대로  입 밖에 낸 것치고는 질책(비난)하는 투의  말하기는 아니었다. 글쎄!  나는 그 문제도 접어두기로  생각했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 비디와 정원을 좀 더 걸으며 풀이 죽은 그녀가 눈을 내리깔고 걷는 모습을 말없이 지켜만 봤다.\\n“난 내 누나의 임종(마지막)에 대해 특별히 들은 바가 없어, 비디.” \\n\\n(아래글 전체가 비디(여자이름)의 긴 대사임) \\n\\n(비디의 긴 대사  시작)\\n\\n\\u3000“들려줄 얘기가 별로 없어, 가엾어라! 그녀는 좋지 않은 건상상태들 중 한 고비에 계셨어. 비록 최근엔 점점 좋아지시는 기미가 있으셨지만, 더 악화되지는 않았으니까, 요 4일 간은 말이야. 하지만 그날 저녁엔 그런 상태에서 깨어나셨고, 차 마실 시간 때쯤이었을 거야, 그리곤  아주 분명하게 ‘조(남편이름)’라고 말하셨어. 난 그녀가 오랫동안 어떤 단어도 말하는 것을 본 적이 없었기 때문에, 대장간으로 달려가서 가  저리 씨(성 씨가 ‘조’, 이름인 ‘가저리’임)를 데리고 왔지. 그녀가 나에게 신호를 보냈단다. ‘당신(조)이 좀 더 내 가까이로 와 앉아주면 좋겠 다고.’ 그리고 ‘내(아내) 두 팔을 그(남편)의 목에 둘러앉을 수 있게 해 주면 좋겠다고.’\\n\\n(비디의 대사가 길어, 읽기 쉽게,  임의로 단락을 한 번 나눕니다.)\\n\\u3000그래서 난 그 두 분이 포옹하실 수 있도록 도와드렸고, 그리고 그녀는 자신의 고개를 그의 어깨 위에 내려놓으시며 더없이 만족해하셨어. 그러시곤 이내 ‘조(남편의 이름)’의 이름을 한 번 더 부르셨단다, 그러곤 ‘미안’이라고 한 번 말하셨고, 또 한 번은 ‘핍(20살 아래의  남동생 이름. 이 소설의 주인공)이라고 발음하시곤. 그러시고는  더는 고개를 들지 못하셨어. 한 시간 후  우린 그녀를  그녀가  사용하던 자신만의  침대 위에 조용히 눕혀드렸단다. 우리도 그녀가 마지막이셨다는 것을 알게  된 거지.”\\n\\n(비디의 긴 대사 끝) \\n\\n\\u3000비디(여자이름)는 울었다. 거무스름해진 정원이, 좁은 길이, 서서히 빛을 내뿜고 있던 별들이 내 시야에서 흐릿해졌다.\\n“무엇이든 밝혀진 건 없었니? 비디.” “없었어.”\\n“올릭(33세, 범인, 사악한 악당)이 어떻게 된지는 알아?”\\n“그의 옷‘들’ 색상으로 보건대 채석장들에서 일하고 있는 거 같아.” “그러니까  그를  한  번이라도  본  적이  있다는  말이니?  아니,  너 왜\\n좁은 길에 서 있는 저 어두운 나무를 바라보고 있는 거니?”\\n\\u3000“조 부인(주인공의 누나)이 죽음을 맞이하던 밤에도 난 그(이름이 ‘올릭’, 범인임)를 저기서  봤는걸.”\\n“그럼 그게 마지막으로 본 게 아니라는 말이니, 비디?”\\n\\u3000“그래, 우리가 여기를 거닌 이후로도 죽 난 저기  서 있는  그를 보았어. 앗, 소용없어!” 비디가 손으로 내 팔을 붙들며 말했다. 내가 막 그리로  뛰쳐나가려던  찰나였다. “내가 널 속일 리 없다는 걸 알잖니.  그는 저기서 1분도 채 서 있지 않다 가버렸어.”\\n\\u3000이 자식이 아직도 비디를 쫒아 다니고 있다는 것을 우연히 알게 되자 내 분노는 극에 달하며 되살아났다. 나는 뼈 속까지 그 자에 대한 혐오감을 느꼈다.\\n나는 비디에게 “그 자를 뼈 속까지 혐오한다.”고 말했다.\\n\\u3000그리고 그녀에게 “내 전 재산을 다 털어서라도 그 자를 이 마을에서 몰아내기 위해 어떤 수고도 아끼지 않을 거야.”라도 말했다.\\n그녀가 점차 보다 온화한 대화 쪽으로 나를 이끌었다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 내게 말했다. 조(주인공의 매형)가 얼마만큼 나(주인공)를 사 랑하는지, 그녀가 내게 말했다, 조는 그 어떤 것에 대해서도 불평해본 적이 없었노라고(주인공이 설레는 마음으로 신사교육을 받고 있던 주인공을 찾아갔을 때 조의 행색과 식사예절이 누추하다고 주인공이 조를 무시한  적이 있었음). 그녀는 조가 불평안하는 대상이 나임은 말하진 않았다. 그것에 대해선 그녀가 굳이 말할 필요도 없었다.\\n나는 그녀가 어떤 의미에서 그 말을 한 건지를 알았다. 그녀가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“네 매부는 어떤 것에 대해서도 불만을 표시한 적이 없어. 단지 자신의 방식대로 주어진 의무를 다해나갈 뿐이야. 그의 강한 손과 조용한 혀 그리고 온화한 마음씨를 가지고서 말이야.”\\n\\u3000“정말, 그에 대해서는 아무리 칭찬해도 과하지 않아.”라며 내가 말했다. “그리고 비디, 우린 이러한 문제들에 대해 자주 의견을 교환하게될 거야. 당연히, 이제부턴 내가 자주 여기로 내려올 거니까. 가엾은 조(매형)만 혼자 여기에 남겨둘 순 없어.”\\n비디는 일언반구도(단 한 마디도) 하지 않았다. “비디, 내말 듣고 있는  거니?”\\n“그래,  핍 씨.”\\n\\u3000“제발 그 놈의 핍 ‘씨’라고 좀 안 하면 안 돼? 하나도 멋지게 들리지 않는단 말이야. 도대체 나를 씨라고 부르는 의도가 뭔데?”\\n“의도가 뭐나니?”\\n\\u3000“비디,” 나는 고결한 척 자신만만해하며 말했다. “내 말은 지금 네가 무슨 의도로 이러는지를 알아야겠다고 요구하는 거야.”\\n“이런다니?”  비디가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“내 말 좀 따라하지 마.” 내가 반박하며 말했다. “너 예전에 안 그랬 잖니, 비디.”\\n“예전엔 안 그랬다니!” 비디가 말했다. “오 핍 씨! 예전에 라니!” \\n이거 참! 나는 그 문제도 접어두는 게 낫겠다고 생각했다.\\n\\u3000또 다시 아무런 말없이 정원을 잠깐 산보한 후, 나는 좀 전 그 문제를  다시 꺼냈다.\\n\\u3000“비디.” 내가 말했다. “나는 내가 고향으로 자주 내려와 조(매형)를  만날 거라는 얘기를 했어. 하지만 넌 굳은 표정으로 내 말을 담담이  들고만 있었을 뿐이야. 부탁이야, 비디, 왜니?”\\n\\u3000“넌 네 자신을 확신할 수 있니, 그러니까, 네가 네 매부를 자주 만나러 올 수 있을 거란 확신 말이야?” 비디가 좁은 정원 산책로에서 걸음을 멈추었다. 그녀가 별들 아래로 맑고 정직한 자신의 눈으로 나를 올려다보았다.\\n\\u3000“아아 저런!” 내가 말했다. 도저히 이 주제로는 비디와 얘기가 더 이상 통하지 않을 것임을 절망스럽게도 내가 받아들이지 않을 수 없다는 마냥  내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이건 인간 본성의 아주 나쁜 측면이야! 적어도 난 그렇게 생각해.  그만, 미안하지만 더 이상 아무런 말도 하지 말 아조. 지금 그 말로도  내겐  충분히 충격적이었으니까.”\\n\\u3000이런 납득할 만한 이유 때문에, 나는 저녁식사 내내 일정한 거리를 비디에게서 두었다. 그리고 내 어린 시절 방이었던 다락방으로 자러 올라갈 때, 비디에게 툴툴거리는 심정에서, 그 날의 장례식행사와 교회 부속 묘지에서의 안장(시신을 땅에 묻음)과 일치시킬 수 있다고 내가 생각할 수 있는 만큼이나 위엄 있게 “그만 자러 갈게”라고 비디에게 말했다.\\n\\u3000밤에 제대로 잠들지 못할  때마다, 그건  한 시간에  4번씩이나 있었다,  난 되씹어보았다.\\n\\u3000‘그녀가 나에게 얼마나 불친절한 행동을 했었는지를,  그녀가 얼마나  내 마음에 상처를 입혔는지를, 그녀가 얼마나 부당하게 나를 평가했었는지를.’\\n\\u3000아침 일찍 나는 떠날 예정이었다. 아침 일찍 나왔다. 그리고 대장간의 목재 창문들 중 하나를 통해 안을 들여다보았다. 나는 그곳에서 조를 바라보며 오랫동안 서 있었다. 그의 얼굴 위에서 백열하듯 달아오른 건강과 힘으로 그는 벌써 일을 시작하고 있었다. 그 모습이 마치 그를 위해 대기하고 있었던 빛나는 생명의 태양이 그의 얼굴 위에서 반짝이고 있는 것 같이 보이게 하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“잘 있으세요, 친애하는 조(55세, 주인공의 매형이름)! 아뇨, 닦아내지 마세요. 제발, 불에 그슬린 그 손을 제게 주세요. 곧 그리고 자주  내려올 거예요,”\\n\\u3000“너무 금방은 오지 마십시오, 나리.” 조(주인공의 매형, 착하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물. 조는 주인공에게 높임말과 반말을 섞어가며 합니다. 물론 영어에선 높임말이 없다지만-_-;; 높임말 느낌~ 반말 느낌~은 있겠죠. 없나????)가 말했다. “그리고 너무 자주 오지도 말거라, 핍(20  세,  주인공 이름)!”\\n\\u3000비디(23세, 여자이름. 주인공과 사귈 수 있었는데 주인공이 런던으로 신사교육을 받으러 가면서 인연이 되지 못한 사이)가 부엌문에서 나를 기다리며 서 있었다. 그녀의 손에는 이웃집에 들러 갓 짜온 신선한 우유 한 잔과 빵 껍질이 들려 있었다.\\n\\u3000“비디.” 내가 작별의 손을 내밀며 말했다. “난 화난 게 아니라 맘을 다쳤을 뿐이야.”\\n\\u3000“안 돼, 상처입지 마.” 그녀가 가여우리만큼 애원하며 말했다. “내가 너그럽지 못했다면(옹졸했다면) 상처는 나만  받아야지.”\\n\\u3000내가 마을을 떠나는 동안 다시 한 번 그때 그 안개가 피어오르고 있 었다.(주인공이 막대한 유산의 상속자가 되고 신사교육을 받기 위해 떠 나던 날 안개가  피어올랐었습니다.)\\n\\u3000만약 안개들이 나에게 폭로했더라면, 지금 피어나고 있는 안개가 실은 그러한 목적이었음을 내가 알아챘더라면, 내가 다시 돌아오지 않을 것임을, 그리고 비디의 말이 전적으로 옳았음을, 나는 다만 “안개들도 또한 전적으로 옳았다.”는 말밖에 달리 할 말이 없다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 36장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000허버트(21세, 주인공의 친구)와 나(20세, 주인공)는 이때쯤 정말이지 끝장을 보고 있었다(허버트와 나는 더욱 나빠졌다). 부채(빚)가 묵과할  수 없는 정도로까지 증가했다는 측면에서도 그랬고, 우리의 문제들(부채들)에 대해 자세히 파헤쳐 본다는 측면에서도 그랬고, 그 놈의 여유두기(부채를 자산으로 생각하는 꼼수두기)를 고수했다는 측면에서도 그랬다. 그 외 그와 같은 부류에 드는 일반적인 상거래들에 있어서도 정말이지 끝장을 보고  있었다.\\n\\u3000어떻게 됐든, 우리들도 어쩔 수 없게 시간은 흘러갔고, 나는 어느덧 성년이 되었다(‘영국 성년 나이’=’유산상속받기 가능한 나이’=’21세부터’).\\n\\u3000“네가 어디에 서 있는지 알기도 전에 넌 성인이 돼 있을 거야”라는, 허버트의 예언을 적중시키며  말이다.\\n\\u3000허버트(주인공의 절친, 21세) 그 자신에 대해서 말하자면 그는 나보다 8개월 먼저 성년이  되었었다.\\n\\u3000성년이 된 것 말고는 그가 부모님으로부터 물려받은 건 그 밖에 아무것도 없었다. 그리고 그가 성년의 나이가 된 것이 바너드 여관(= 허버트 집 = 런던시내서쪽 = 주인공도 이따금씩 같이 거주함)에서 깊은 감동이  되지도 못했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 우리는 내 21번째 생일을 많은 추론들과 기대들을 하면서 학 수고대하고 있었는데, 왜냐하면 내 후견인(재거스 변호사 = 주인공에게 유산을 물러주는 사람이 아니라 단지 주인공의 법률담당 후견인임. 주인공이 성년이 아니라서 후견인 필요했음)이 그런 경우 명확한 어떤 말(유산상속 확답)을 하지 않을 수밖에 없을 것으로 우리 모두 생각하고  있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000나는 내 생일이 언제인지를 ‘리틀 브리튼’(런던 북서쪽에 있는 거리 이름, 재거스 변호사 사무실이 위치해 있음)에서 충분히 인지할 수 있 도록  조치를 취했었다.\\n\\u3000내 생일 하루 전날, 나는 웨믹(변호사사무실 서기)으로부터 공식적인 서류 한 통을 받았다. 거기엔 이렇게 적혀 있었다.\\n\\u3000〈 그 복되고 좋은 날 오후 5시에 귀하께서 재거스 씨를 방문해 주신다면 재거스 씨가 더할 나위 없이 기뻐할 것입니다.〉\\n\\u3000이 서류를 통해 우리(엄청난 빚에 쪼들리고 있던 ‘주인공과 허버트’) 는 ‘어마어마한 어떤 일이 있을 예정이구나.’라는 확신을 하게 되었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 이 서류는 내가 시간엄수의 본보기인 마냥 정확히 오후 5시에 내 후견인(재거스 변호사)의 사무실로 갔을 때 내 심장을 유달리 “콩닥콩닥”  뛰게 만들었다.\\n\\u3000변호사사무실 대기실에서, 웨믹은 나에게 “축하드립니다.”라는 말을 건넸다. 그리고 ‘티슈 페이퍼(투명하고 얇은 종이)’를 한 번 접더니 자신의 코 옆에다가 비볐다. 나는 그 ‘티슈 페이퍼(종이)’의 모양새가 참 좋았다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그는 이 행동에 관해서 어떠한 말도 하지 않고, 다만 내가 변호사님의 집무실로 들어가도 좋다는 승낙의 고개 끄덕임을 한 번 지 어보였다.\\n\\u3000때는 어느덧 11월이었다. ‘벽난로 위 선반’에 등을 기댄 채 그(재거스 변호사)는 벽난로 앞에 서 있었다. 그의 두 손은 이미 ‘웃옷’의 뒷   자락 깊숙이 박힌 지  오래였다.\\n\\u3000“그래, 핍(21세, 주인공이름).” 재거스 변호사(48세)가 말했다. “아니지, 오늘부터는 핍 씨라 불러야 되겠군. 어쨌든 축하하네, 핍 씨.”\\n\\u3000우리는 악수를 나누었다. 그는 언제나 눈에 띌 만큼 짧은 시간동안만  악수를 했다.\\n나도 그에게 “고맙습니다.”라는 말을 했다.\\n\\u3000내가 자리에 앉자, 그가 예의 그 삐딱한 자세를 취했다. 자신의 부츠(목이 긴 신발)를 향해 고개를 구부린 것이다.\\n\\u3000나는 불리하다고 느꼈다. 왜냐하면 그의 행동이 나로 하여금 내가 예전에 도망 나온 죄수에 의해 묘지석 위에서 반강제로 물구나무를 서 졌었던 옛 기억을 떠올리게 했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000흉측하게 생긴 두 개의 주물(쇳물을 녹여 만든  사람얼굴모양의 주물)은 그와 멀지않은 곳에 떨어져 있었는데, 그 두상의 표정이 마치 어느 아둔한 ‘뇌졸 증’(중풍) 환자가 우리의 대화를 엿듣기 위해 애를 쓰고 있는 것 같이  보였다.\\n\\u3000“그럼, 젊은 친구.” 마치 내가 증인석에 앉아 있는 증인인 마냥 내 후견인이 말하기 시작했다. “내가 자네에게 한 두 마디 정도 잔소리를   좀  할까 하는데.”\\n“기꺼이  들려주십시오, 선생님.”\\n\\u3000“자네가 생각하기에.” 재거스 씨가 말했다. 그는 몸을 앞으로 구부려 바닥을 본 다음 머리를 뒤로 젖혀 천정을 살폈다. “그래 자네는 지금 자네가 어느 정도의 생활비로 살고 있다고 생각하는가?”\\n“어느 정도의 생활비라니요,  선생님?”\\n\\u3000“어느 정도,” 여전히 천장에서 눈을 떼지 않은 채 재거스 씨가 다시 말했다. “어느 정도의 생활비로  말일세.”\\n\\u3000그러더니 방 여기저기를 둘러보았다. 그러더니 자기 손에 쥐어져 있던 손수건을 코 쪽으로 절반 정도 가져가다가 행동을 멈추었다.\\n\\u3000나는 툭하면 내 문제들(부채들)을 들여다보았었고, 그래서 난 그 부채들의 영향들에 대해 언젠가 가졌을지도 모를 어떤 사소한 생각마저 완전히  망각한지 오래였다.\\n마지못해, 난 그 질문에 전혀 답변할 수 없음을 인정했다. 이런 내 태도가 재거스 씨에게도 먹힌 것 같았다.\\n그가 말했다.\\n“나도 그런 줄  알았네!”\\n그러더니 만족해서는 코를 세게  풀었다.\\n\\u3000“자, 내가 자네에게 질문을 하나 한 것이네, 내 친구.” 재거스 씨가 말했다. “그래 내게 물어볼 게 있겠지?”\\n\\u3000“물론 제가 선생님께 몇 가지 사안들에 대해 물어볼 수 있다면 제겐  큰 위안이 될 것입니다,  선생님. 하지만 선생님의  금지사항(누가 상속을 주려는 건지 묻지 말 것)도 기억하고 있는 걸요.”\\n“하나만 묻게.” 재거스 씨가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“제 은인이 누구인지 오늘 알 수 있을까요?(오늘 알게 될 예정입니까?)”\\n“아니. 자 다음  질문.”\\n“그 비밀이 곧 제게 전달될 예정입니까?”\\n“그 질문은 잠시 보류해두세.” 재거스 씨가 말했다. “자 다른 질문.” \\n\\u3000나는 내 주변을 둘러보았다. 하지만 이제 이  질문을 비껴갈 가능성은 전혀 없을 것만 같았다.\\n“제가…무엇을…받나요, 선생님?”\\n\\u3000이 질문에 대해 재거스 씨가 환희에 취해 “우리가 그 주제를 다룰지 알고 있었네!”라고 말하더니 “핍 씨에게 그 서류(변호사 사무실의 현금 출납부) 한 장을 가져다주게.”라며 웨믹(변호사사무실의 서기. 현금출 납도 담당하는 서기)에게  소리쳤다.\\n\\u3000웨믹이 손에 그것(현금 출납부)을 들고 집무실  안으로  들어왔다가 다시 사라졌다.\\n\\u3000“자, 핍 씨.” 재거스 씨가 말했다. “부디 주의해서 듣게. 자네는 여 기에(주인공이 마구 서명하고 돌아다닌 수표들)다가 아주 자유롭게 서명을 하고 다녔더군. 웨믹(변호사 사무실의 서기)의 현금 출납부에 자 네의 이름이 꽤 자주 발견되는 것을 보니까 말이네. 하지만 모두다 부채더군, 당연하겠지?”\\n“제가 ‘예스’라고 말씀드리기조차 민망 하군요, 선생님.”\\n\\u3000“자네는 ‘예스’라고 답해야 한다는 걸 알 텐데. 안 그런가?” 재거스  씨가 말했다.\\n“‘예스’입니다, 선생님.” \\n\\u3000“(재거스 변호사의 대사임→) 자네가 얼마를 빚지고 있는지는 따로 또 묻지 않겠네, 어차피 자네도 알지 못할 테니까. 물론 자네가 안다해도 내겐 말하지 않을 테지. 아니면 더 적게 말하든가. 좋아, ‘예스’다 이거지.  내 친구.”\\n\\u3000마지막 대목에서 재거스 씨는 큰 소리로 말했는데, 내가 그의 말(주인공이 거짓말을 할 거라는 말)에 불복하는 태도를 보이려고 했기 때문에 자신의 집게손가락을 흔들어서 나를 제기하기 위해서였다.\\n\\u3000“당연한 일이지만 자넨 그러지(거짓말하지) 않을 거라고 생각하겠지, 아닐세, 자넨 그러게 되어 있네. 자넨 내게 변명을 하려고 드는군, 하지만 자네보다 내가 더 잘 알지. 자, 이 종이 한 장을 자네에게 건네주 겠네. 받았나? 아주 잘 됐군. 자, 그럼 펼쳐보게 그리고 그것이 무엇인지  내게 말해보게.”\\n“이것은  2억  5천만  원짜리,”  내가  말했다.  “은행  수표입니다.” \\n“맞네, 그것은 은행 수표네.” 재거스 씨가 내말을 반복했다. “2억 하\\n고도 5천만 원짜리지. 또한 아주 큰 금액이기도 하지, 내 생각엔 말일    세. 어때 자네도  동의하겠지?”\\n“달리  제가  뭐라  더  말씀드릴  수  있겠습니까!” \\n“아! 하지만 질문에 답하게.” 재거스 씨가 말했다. “틀림없이  큰 금액입니다.”\\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000(아래 내용 전체가  재거스 변호사의  아주아주 긴 대사입니다.^^ 뭐니 이 긴 대사  -_-;;)\\n\\n\\u3000“틀림없이, 자네는 그것이 아주 큰돈이라고 생각하는군. 이제, 그 큰돈 모두가 자네 소유일세, 핍(주인공이름, 21세). 이것은  자네가  유산을 본격적으로 물려받기 전에 자네에게 할당된 작은 선물이네. 그리고 매년 그와 똑같은 액수의 금액(2억  5천만 원의 수표)이 자네에게  지급될 것이며, 그것은 자네에게 유산 전체를 물려줄 기증자가 모습을 드러낼 때까지 계속될 것이네. 하지만 그때까지는 매년 생활비로 2억 5  천만 원 이상은 곤란하네.\\n\\u3000다시 말해, 이제부터는 자네 생활비와 관련된 일체의 제반사항을 자네가 직접 처리해야할 것이며, 자네가 직접 웨믹(변호사사무실의 서기, 사무실의 출납도 같이 담당)에게 받아가야  할 것이네.  물론 자네가 타갈 금액은 매분기(3개월)마다 정확히 6천 2백 5십만 원일 것이고. 이도 또한 자네가 그 돈의 근원(기증자)과 직접 연락을 취하기 전까지네 (기증자에게 용돈 올려달라고 직접 협상을 할 때까지). 그럼 그땐 더이상 한낱 에이전트(대리인)는 필요치 않을 테니까.\\n\\u3000내가 전에 자네에게 들려준 얘기 기억하는가? 잘 듣게, 난 이 일에 있어서 한낱 에이전트에  지나지 않네. 난  지시사항을  이행할  뿐이며,  그 하나하나에 대해 수수료를 지급받고 있네. 나는 내가 받은 지시사 항들이 자네의 상황(돈을 물써듯이 쓰는 나쁜 행동)에 적절치 못하다고 생각하지만, 그건 내 생각이고 어쨌든 내가 그런 지시사항들의 가  치에 대해 언급할 권한까지 지급받은 것은 아니니까.”\\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000(여기까지가 재거스 씨의 아주 긴 대사였습니다. 단락은 임의로 3번 나누었지만 원문에는 그냥 긴 하나의 단락입니다o^^o)\\n\\n\\u3000내가 막 ‘저에게 지급되는 이런 관대함과 공평무사함에 대해 제 은인에게 제가 감사하더란 말을 전해줄 수 있나요?’하는 식의 말을 꺼내 려고 하자,\\n재거스 씨(런던의 유명한  변호사이름)가  나를  제지하며  말했다. “자네의  말을  어느  누군가에게  전하는  것에  대해,”  그가  냉담하게\\n말했다. “난 지급받지  않았네.”\\n\\u3000그러더니 그 주제를 요약했던 방식 그대로 자신의 코트 뒷자락을 확 걷어 올리더니, 마치 자신의 부츠(목이 긴 구두)가 자신을 음해할 계략을 꾸몄다는 의심을 하고 있는 마냥, 자신의 부츠를 노려보며 서 있었다.\\n잠깐 동안의 침묵이 흐른 후, 내가 넌지시 알려주었다.\\n\\u3000“방금 전에 제가 했던 질문 있지 않습니까, 재거스 씨. 당신이 제게  잠시 보류해보자며 말씀하셨던 그거요. 그 질문을 다시 해도 되겠습니까?”\\n“(생판 처음 듣는다는 식으로) 무슨 질문?” 그가 말했다. \\n\\u3000나는 그가 나를 절대 구제해주지 않을 것임을 알았어야했는데(몰랐다는 의미임). 하지만 내가 전혀 새로운 질문을 꺼내는 양, 대화의 뒤로 돌아가 그 질문을 새로이 설명해야만 하는 상황은 나를 깜짝 놀라게 했다.\\n\\u3000“음, 할 가능성이….” 내가 사뭇 머뭇거린 후 말했다.  “제 후원자께서, 그러니까 재거스 씨께서 언급하신 그 근원(돈의 근원)께서는, 그러니까 제 말은, 제 후원자께서 곧….”\\n\\u3000“곧 뭔가?” 재거스 씨가 물었다. “현재 상태 그대로는 절대 질문이 안  되네, 알잖은가.”\\n\\u3000“곧 런던으로 오십니까?” 나는 정확한 단어들의 형식을 생각해 내려고 애쓴 후 말했다. “아님 어떤  다른  곳으로  저를  부르실  생각이신 지?”\\n\\u3000“자, 이 시점에서,” 재거스  씨(변호사)의  어둡고 움푹한 눈이 나에게 한 차례 고정되더니 그가 대꾸했다. “우리는 예전에 자네 마을에서 우리가 서로 처음 마주쳤던 그 날 저녁(재거스 씨가 주인공을 찾아와서 ”저 애는 이제 막대한 유산을 상속받게 되었소.“라며 알려주던 날)으로 되돌아가야하네. 그래 내가 그때 자네에게 무어라 얘기했었나, 핍(주인공이름)?”\\n\\u3000“재거스 씨, 그 후원자가 나타나려면 향후 수년이 걸릴 지도 모른다고 당신은 제게  말했었습니다.”\\n“그대로네.” 재거스 씨가 말했다. “그게 내 대답이네.” \\n\\u3000우리가 서로를 똑바로 바라보는 동안, 나는 그에게서 뭔가를 끄집어내고 말겠다는 강한 욕망에서 내 호흡이 점점 가빠지는 것을 느꼈다.\\n\\u3000그리고  내 호흡이  점점 가빠지고 있음을 내가  느꼈기 때문에, 그리고 그가 지금 내 호흡이 가빠지는 것을 보고 있음을 내가 느끼기 때문에, 나는 그에게서 어떤 정보라도 끄집어 낼 가능성이 그 언제보다 더 적어졌다는  것을 느꼈다.\\n\\u3000“당신도 그렇게 생각하십니까? 그게 향후 수년은 더 걸릴 거라고요, 재거스 씨?”\\n\\u3000재거스 씨가 고개를 흔들었다. 그건 내 방금 질문에 대한 부정의 의미가 아니었다. 그건 내가 어떻게 해서든 그가 질문에 답하게끔 만들 수 있을 거라는 내 생각을 전적으로 부정하는 의미에서의 고개 짓이었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 내 시선이 그것들(얼굴 주물들)에 가 멈추었을 때, 누가 얼굴 한쪽을 홱 잡아당긴 것 같은 ‘그 2개의 흉측한 얼굴 주물’(쇳물을 녹여 만든 사람얼굴모양의 주물)들은 일시 정지되었던 자신들의  주의력이 위기 상황을 맞게 된 마냥 막 재채기를 하려는 것처럼 보였다.\\n“자(진정하게)!”\\n\\u3000재거스 씨가 데워진 자신의 두 손등으로 다리 뒷부분들을 따뜻하게 하면서 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이제 확실히 말해야겠군. 내 친구 핍(핍은 주인공 이름). 그것은 나에게 요구해선 안 되는 질문이었네. 어떤가, 그 질문이 나를 위태롭게 만드는 질문이라고 내가 자네에게 말해준다면 자네가 그 문제를 좀 더  잘 이해할 수 있을 걸세. 그럼! 자네와 좀 더 멀리 가 볼까. 내가 좀  더 들려주겠네.”\\n\\u3000“그 사람이 모습을 드러낼 때,” 재거스 씨가 자세를 바로 잡으며 말했다. “자네와 그 사람은 자신들만의 일을 마무리 짓게 될 것이네. 그 사람이 모습을 드러낼 때, 이 일에서의 내 역할도 종지부를 짓게 될 것이네. 그 사람이 모습을 드러내면, 내가 이 일에 대해 어떤 것도 더 알아야 될 필요가 없어질 걸세. 그리고 그것이 내가 자네에게 꼭 들려 주고  싶은 전부이고.”\\n\\u3000우리는 서로를 쳐다보았다. 내가 시선을 거둘 때까지 그대로 있었다. 그리고 우리는 생각에 잠겨 바닥을 내려다보았다.\\n\\u3000그의 마지막 말에서, 나는 미스 해비샴(‘주인공 마을’ 인근 ‘읍내 외곽’에 사는 최고의 갑부)이 어떤 이유에선가 아니면 전혀 이유가 없어서인가 간에 그녀(미스 해비샴)가 나를 에스텔라와 이어줄려는 계획에 관해서 속마음을 그(재거스 씨)에게 얘기하지 않았음을 유추하게 되었다. 아마도 그것이 재거스 씨를 화나게 했고 그래서 질투심을 느끼는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그게 아니라면 그가 그녀의  계획에  관해  정말로  반대했을 수도 있다. 그래서 이 일에 그가 전혀 관여하지 않으려는 의도일 수도 있었다. 내가 다시 시선을 들어 그를 바라보았을 때 나는 그가 줄곧 나를 예리한 눈으로 쳐다보고 있었음을 발견했다. 그리고 지금도 여전히 그런 눈으로 나를 쳐다보며 서 있었다. \\n\\u3000“만약 그것이 제게 들려주시고 싶었던 전부라면요, 선생님.” 내가 발언했다. “저도 더 말씀드릴 것이 없을 것 같습니다.”\\n\\u3000그가 동의의 표시로 고개를 끄덕였다. 그가 런던 도둑들이 모두 무 서워한다는 시계를 꺼내들었다.(도둑들이 훔치고 싶어 하는 비싼 시계지만 유명한 변호사인 재거스 씨에게 걸려 교도소에 오래 갇혀 있을까봐 두려워한다는 의미) 그가 내게 저녁 먹으러 어디로 갈 거냐고  물었다.\\n\\u3000나는 내 방에서 허버트(주인공의 절친, 21세)와 먹을 생각이라고 대답했다.\\n\\u3000그리고 불가피한 대화의 연속으로써, 그가 우리와 함께 식사를 하는 호의를 베풀어줄 수 있는지를 내가 그에게 물었고, 그는 즉시 내 초대를 받아들였다.\\n하지만 그는 주장했다. “자네와  함께 걸어가겠네.”\\n\\u3000이것은 내가 그를 위해 어떤 과도한 준비도 하지 못하게 하려는 의 도에서였다.\\n\\u3000그는 우선 쓸 편지가 하나 혹은 둘 있었다. 그리고 씻어야할 손들도 있었다.(재거스 씨는 자신의 집무실에서 누구를 만나 얘기를 나눈 후에는 향기나는 비누로 꼭 손과 목 얼굴을 씻는 버릇이 있습니다.)\\n\\u3000그래서 “대기실(변호사사무실의 대기실)로 나가 웨믹(변호사사무실의 서기. 현금출납도 같이 담당함. 주인공이 변호사사무실에 들러 돈을 타갈 때 만나는 사람임)과 얘기를 나누고 있겠습니다.”라고 내가 말씀드렸다.\\n\\u3000사실, 2억 5천만 원짜리 수표가 내 수중에 들어왔을 때 내 머리 속에 생각 하나가 떠올랐는데 그건 내가 이전부터 자주 생각해오던 것이었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 지금 그런 생각에 대해 조언을 구할만한 착한 사람으로서 웨 믹(변호사사무실의 서기)만한 이가 없을 거라는 생각이 들었다.\\n\\u3000웨믹은 벌써 금고(웨믹이 보관하는 조그마한 금고)의 자물쇠를 걸어 잠그고 퇴근할 준비를 마친  상태였다.\\n\\u3000그는 자기 자리를 떠나 ‘기름기가 도는’ 2개의  ‘사무실  촛대들’을 꺼내 문 가까이에 있는 두꺼운 널빤지 위에 있던 양초 심지 절단용 가위와 일렬로 세워놓은 상태였다. 그는 그렇게 촛불을 끌 준비를 마쳤다.\\n\\u3000그는 벽난로에 갈퀴질을 해 불 길을 낮추어놓은 후 자신의 모자와 거대한 외투를 꺼내 입을 준비를 마친 상태였다. 그리고 자신의 금고 열쇠를 가지고 외투 가슴 부위 곳곳을 두들겨 펴고 있었다(열쇠로 외투를 펴고 있었다). 그것은 일종의 근무 종료 후에 하는 운동의 일환이었다(운동선수의 운동이었다).\\n\\u3000“웨믹(43세) 씨.”(부연설명 → 디킨스가 쓴 웨믹의 얼굴묘사 : 「함께 걸으며 나(주인공)는 웨믹 씨에게 눈을 돌려 그가 햇볕 아래에서 어떻게 보일지를 살펴보았다. 나는 곧 그가 좀 딱딱한 사람이고 키가  다소 작은 편이고, 사각형 턱에, 가장자리를 무딘 정(돌 깎는 도구)으로 뭉갠 것 같은 얼굴의 소유자라는 것을 알 수 있었다.」 자세한 내  용은  21장 참조)\\n내(주인공,  21세)가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“조언을 구할 게 좀 있는데요. 제 친구(이름이 ‘허버트’)를 도와주고 싶거든요.”\\n\\u3000그의 우체통 같은 입이 굳게 닫혔다. 그리곤 그가 고개를 저었다. 마치 “자신이 아주 좋아하는 대상에 대해 사족을 못 쓰는 약점에 대해 내 의견을 묻는다면, 내 대답은 하나올시다. 둘 다 끝장난다는 것이 요.”라고 말하는 것만  같았다.\\n\\u3000“이 친구는,” 내가 계속 말을 이어갔다. “이 친구는 상업계에서 출세 해보려고 시도하고 있지만 자본이 전혀 없어요. 그래서 사업을 시작조차 못해 언제나 의기소침해 있거든요. 그래서 제가 그가 어쨌든 시작이나 좀 할 수 있게 도와주고 싶은데요.”\\n\\u3000“현금으로요?” 웨믹이 말했다. 그 말투는 세상 어느 톱밥보다도 더 건조했다.\\n\\u3000“약간의 현금으로요.” 내가 대답했다. 왜냐하면 집에 반듯하게 접어 꼬리표를 붙인 후 대칭적으로 묶어놓은 계산서 한 보따리가 뇌리를 스 쳐지나갔기 때문이다. 물론 거북하고 불안한 떠올림이었지만.\\n내가  계속 말했다.\\n“약간의 현금으로요. 그리고 어쩌면 제가 앞으로 받게 될 유산을 약간 보증으로 해서라 도요.” \\n\\u3000“핍 씨(핍은 주인공 이름).” 웨믹(43세,  변호사사무소  서기)이 말했다. “괜찮으시다면, 저와 함께 제 손가락들을 가지고 첼시유역에 잔뜩 쌓아 올려져있는 각양각색 다리들의 이름들을 재빨리 훑어볼까요. 어디 봅시다, 첫째 런던 다리, 둘째 서더크(템즈강 남쪽) 다리, 셋째 블 랙프라이어스(‘도미니크 수도회’라는 뜻임) 다리. 넷째 워털루(영국이 이긴 전쟁이름) 다리, 다섯째 웨스트민스터(의사당 있는 곳) 다리, 여섯째  복스홀(????) 다리까지.”\\n\\u3000그는 자신의 금고열쇠 손잡이를 손바닥 위에 얹어놓은 채, 각각의 다리를  차례차례 체크했다.\\n“보십시오, 고를 수 있는 다리가 여섯 개나 된답니다.” \\n“뭔 소리신지 모르겠는걸요.” 내가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“어디 한 번 당신의 다리를 선택해보세요, 핍 씨.” 웨믹이 되물었다. “어서요, 당신이 고른 다리 위에서 산책해보세요. 당신이 고른 다리의 중심 아치 너머로, 템스 강에 당신의 돈을 던져보세요. 그럼 그것으로 당신의 돈은 끝이라는 걸 알 수 있을 겁니다. 그 돈으로 친구를 도와 줘보세요. 그럼 그 돈도 역시 끝이라는 걸 알게 될 겁니다. 하지만 돈  으로 친구를 도와준 경우가 덜 즐겁고 덜 유익한 끝이지요.”\\n\\u3000그는 이 말을 한 후 자신의 입을 아주 넓게 벌렸기 때문에 나는 어쩌면 그의 입 속으로 신문지 한 장을 다 넣을 수 있었을 지도 모른다고 생각했다.\\n“의기소침하게 하는 발언이시네요.” 내가 말했다.\\n“의기소침 좀 해보시라고 드린 말씀입니다.” 웨믹이 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그럼 그게 웨믹 씨의 의견이신가요.” 내가 아주 살짝 발끈해서 물었다. “그럼 절대  주어서는….”\\n\\u3000“…친구에게 휴대할 수 있는 재산을 투자해서는 안 되냐고요?(‘휴대할 수 있는 재산’이란 말은 웨믹이 즐겨 사용하는 말임)” 웨믹이 말했다. “암 그렇고말고요. 절대 그렇게 해서는 안 됩니다. 만약 그 친구와 절교하고 싶으시다면 모를까요. 그 뒤에는 친구와 절교하는 것이 얼마나 많은 재산상의 가치가 있는지가 또 다른 질문이 되겠지만, 물론 이 경우에도 재산이란 휴대할 수 있는 재산을 지칭하는 말입니다.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 그게,” 내(21세, 주인공)가 말했다. “웨믹 씨의 복잡 미묘하신 (신중한) 답변이신가요?”\\n\\u3000“그게 바로,” 그(43세, 이름이 ‘웨믹’)가 대답했다. “그게 바로 제 신중한 소견입니다. 적어도 이 사무실에선 말이죠.”\\n\\u3000“앗!” 내가 그의 손을 꼬옥~ 잡으며 말했다. 왜냐하면 이 문제에 있어서 그가 막 작은 구멍으로 빠져나가는 것을 내가 보았다고 생각했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000내가 말했다. “그럼 ‘월워스’(런던 도심지역. 런던 한 복판임, 웨믹의 집)에서의 당신의 소견도 그와  같을까요?”\\n\\u3000“핍 씨(주인공의 이름이 ‘핍’임).” 그가 응답했다.  아주 엄숙한 태도로 말이다. “월워스(웨믹의 집)와 이 사무실은 별개의 장소입니다. 저의 ‘연로하신 아버님’과 재거스 씨가 전혀 다른 존재이듯이 말입니다. 그 둘을 합쳐서 어리둥절해 해서는 안 됩니다. 월워스(웨믹의 집)에서의 제 감정들은 월워스의 몫입니다. 하지만 이 사무실에서는 단지 제 공무상의(공식의) 감정들 외에는 전혀 있을 수 없습니다.”\\n\\u3000“(마지못해 동의한다는 뜻으로) 좋습니다.” 내가 한층 고무되어 말했다. “그럼 월워스(웨믹의 집)로 제가 언제 한 번 찾아뵈어야겠군요. 정말이에요, 꼭 찾아뵙도록  할게요.”\\n\\u3000“핍 씨(‘핍’은 주인공 이름”).” 그가 응대했다. “그곳에서 당신은 언제든 환영받으실 겁니다. 사적이고 개인적인 자격이시라 면요.”\\n\\u3000우리는 소곤소곤 이 대화를 이어가고 있었었다. 우린 내 후견인(48세, 재거스 변호사)의 귀가 예리하기론 세계 최강임을 잘 알고 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그(재거스 변호사)가 이제 집무실 출입문에 모습을 드러냈기 때문에, 물론 타워로 두 손을 닦으며 말이다. 어쨌든 재거스 씨가 모습을 드러 냈기 때문에, 웨믹(43세, 변호사 사무실의 서기)은 자신의 거대한 외투를 차려 입고 사무실 촛불들을 끄기 위해 준비했다.\\n\\u3000우리 세 사람은 다 함께 거리로 나아갔다. 그리고 건물 현관 앞에서 웨믹은 자기 집 쪽으로 몸을 틀었고,  나와 재거스 씨는 우리  집 쪽으로  몸을 돌렸다.\\n\\u3000나는 그 날 저녁 ‘제라드 거리’(재거스 씨의 집. 런던 중앙임)에도 재거스 씨의 이맛살을 약간은 펴줄 누군가가, 아니면 어떤 것이, 아니면 대포(웨믹의 아버지를 기쁘게 했던 대포)가, 아니면 연로하신 아버님이 계시면 좋겠다고 적어도 한 번 이상은 희망하지 않을 수 없었다.\\n\\u300021번째 생일날(성년이 되었음)에 재거스 씨가 만들어 놓은 그러한 조심스럽고 의심 많은 세상 속에서 성년이 된 것이 전혀 가치 있어 보이지 않았다는 것은 기분이 좋지 않은 고찰(깊은 살핌)이었다.\\n\\u3000재거스 씨(48세, 변호사)는 웨믹(43세, 서기)보다 천(1000)배는 더 박식했고 천 배는 더 똑똑했다. 그럼에도 불구하고 나는 그보다는 오히려 웨믹과 천 배는 더 식사를 같이 하고 싶었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 재거스 씨는 단지 나만 밑도 끝도 없는 울적함 속으로 밀어넣은  것이 아니었다.\\n\\u3000재거스 씨가 돌아간 후, 허버트(주인공의 절친)가 벽난로의 불에 시선을 고정시킨 채 자기 자신에 대해 이렇게 말하고 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“내 생각에 난 어떤 흉악범죄를 저질렀음이 분명해. 그리곤 그 자세한 내막을 잊었었음도 분명하고.”\\n그는 아주 풀이 죽은 채 죄의식을 느끼고 있었다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 37장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000월워스(웨믹의 집. 런던 도심지역. 정확히 런던 한 복판)에 들러 웨믹 씨에게서 의견을 듣기에 가장 좋은 날이 일요일이라고 간주한 나는, 돌아오는 일요일 오후를 웨믹(43세, 서기)의 성(집)으로 순례여행 하는 데 보내기로  마음먹었다.\\n\\u3000흉벽(집의 벽) 앞에 도착하자마자, 나는  ‘유니언  잭(영국국기 이름)’이 팔랑이고 있는 것을 발견했다. 그리고 그의 집으로 건너갈 수 있는 도개교(들어 올리는 다리)도 올라져있는 것을 발견했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이런 대담한 반항과 앙칼짐에의 표시에도 저지되지 않은 나는 출입구에 있는 벨을 눌렸다. 그리고 그의 연로하신 아버님께서 최대한의 평화로운 매너로 나를 안으로 맞으셨다.\\n\\u3000“선생님, 제 아들놈은요,” 연로하신 그의 아버님(귀가 아주 많이 안 들리심)은 도개교를 다시 잡아매신 후 말했다. “아무래도 선생님께서 한 번 들리실 것 같다고 녀석은 생각했습니다. 그래서 ‘오후 산책이 끝 나는 대로 집으로 바로 올게요.’라는 말을 남겨놓았었죠. 제 아들놈은 언제나 그 시간이면 산책을 나가거든요, 제 아들 녀석이죠. 매사 아주 규칙적인 삶을 사는, 어김없는 제 아들 녀석이죠.”\\n\\u3000나는 노인장(웨믹의 아버지. 귀가 아주 많이 안 들리심)에게 고개를 끄떡여주었다. 웨믹이 그 자리에 있었다면 아버님에게  끄떡여드렸을  만큼 나도 고개를 끄떡여드렸다. 그런 다음 우리는(노인장과 주인공) 안으로 들어가 벽난로 가에 자리를 잡고 앉았다.\\n\\u3000“선생님(주인공)께서 제 아들 녀석을 알게 된 게,” 노인장께서는 참새가 짹짹거리듯이 불꽃을 향해 자신의 두 손을 내밀어 쪼이면서 말했다. “녀석의 사무실에서겠지요, 제 생각이?”\\n내가  고개를 끄떡여드렸다.\\n\\u3000“아하! 제 아들 녀석이 이 업계에서 평판이 자자한 일꾼이 라죠. 선생님?”\\n내가 부지런히 고개를  끄떡여드렸다.\\n\\u3000“그럼요, 사람들이 제게 들려준걸요. 녀석이 활동하고 있는 직종이 법조계라면서요?”\\n내가 아까보다 더 부지런히 고개를 끄떡여드렸다.\\n\\u3000“그 사실이 더 놀랐습죠, 제 아들 녀석의 경우엔 말입니다.”라고 노인장이 말했다. “왜냐하면 녀석은 법 같은 것을 배우며 자란 것이 아니거든요, 실은 포도주 통 제조업을 배우며 자랐습죠.”\\n\\u3000나는 그 노인장이 재거스 씨(런던의 유명한 변호사)의 명성에 대해서도 어떻게 알고 계시는지 알고 싶은 호기심이 생겨, 그에게 재거스  씨의 이름을 고함쳐  불러드렸다.\\n\\u3000그가 갑자기 아주 활달한 태도로 진심으로 웃으며 대답했기 때문에  난 잠시 큰 공황상태에 빠지고 말았다.\\n그가 말했다.\\n“아니, 분명합니다. 선생님이  옳습니다.”\\n\\u3000바로 지금까지 나는 그의 대답의 의미가 무엇이었는지 그리고 내가  어떤 조크(농담)를 했었다고 그가 생각하고 그렇게 대답하신 것이었는지 아주 희미하게 로라도 생각해낼 수가 없다.\\n\\u3000그의 관심을 끌만한 어떤 다른 시도도 하지 않은 채, 노인장께 끊임  없이 고개만 끄떡인 채로 그 자리에 앉아 있을 순 없었기 때문에, 난  큰 소리로 외치며 노인장 자신의 예전 직업도 또한 ‘포도주 통 제조업자’이셨는지  어떤지를 여쭈어봤더랬다.\\n\\u3000‘포도주 통 제조업자’라는 용어를 그에게 설명해드리려고 내가 몇 번이고 안간힘을 쓰고 그리고 그 용어와 노인장 자신을 연결시키기 위해 노인장의 가슴 부위를 톡톡 두들겨드린 덕분에, 난 최종적으로 그 노 인장과 그럭저럭 의사소통을 하는 데 성공했다.\\n\\u3000“아니요.” 노인장이 말했다. “창고를 관리했습죠,  창고 말입니다. 저기 너머에 있는 창고  말입니다.”\\n   굴뚝 위쪽을 의미하시는 것 같았다. 하지만 내 생각엔 그가 리버풀(영국 항구도시. ‘런던에서 리버풀’까지의 거리는 대략 ‘서울에서 대구까지의 거리’임)을 가리키시려고 하신 것 같았다.\\n그가  계속 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그 다음엔 런던 시티(런던타워 근처)에 있었습죠. 여기 이곳 말입니다. 하지만 병을 얻는 바람에… 귀가요 귀가 거의 먹다시피 했거든요, 선생님….”\\n\\u3000“(몸짓과 입모양만으로) 정말 놀랬어요, 어르신.”라고 나는 무언극의 배우처럼 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그럽죠. 귀가 먹었습죠. 귀가. 우연히 귓병을 앓는 바람에…, 제 아들 녀석이 법조계에 들어가게 되었습죠. 저를 책임져야했었거든요. 녀석은 조금씩, 조금씩 일구어나갔답니다. 이 멋지고 아름다운 집과 정원을 말입죠. 하지만 선생님께서 말씀하셨던 아까 그 얘기로 다시 돌아 가자면, 아실 테지만,”\\n\\u3000또 다시 진심에서 우러나오신 웃음을 지으시곤 노인장이 계속해서 이야기를 이어가셨다.\\n\\u3000“무어라 설명드릴 도리가 없지만 서도, 분명, 분명히 선생님이 옳으 십니다요.”\\n\\u3000나는 삼가 불가사의하게 여기고 있었다. 내가 최대한의 창의력을 발 휘한다면, 지금 이 노인장을 흥겹게 하고 있는 그 ‘허의(상상)의 농담’의 반만큼이라도 내가 그를 흥겹게 할 수 있는 어떤 무엇인가를 고안해낼 수 있을지  없을지를.\\n\\u3000그때 굴뚝의 한쪽 벽 속에서 갑자기 “찰깍”하는 소리가 나면서, 그  위에 “존”이라고 적힌 작은 나무뚜껑이 유령같이 텀블링(재주넘기)을 하며 열리는 바람에 나는 깜짝 놀랐다.\\n내 시선을 쫓던 노인장이 승리감에 도취되어 소리쳤다. “내 아들이 집에  돌아왔소!”\\n\\u3000그리곤 우리 둘 모두 도개교(들어 올리는 다리)까지 나아갔다. (‘디킨스가  묘사한’  웨믹의  집으로  갈  때  건너야하는  ‘도개교의 모습은?’\\n→ 「 그가 말한 다리는 두꺼운 판자 한 짝이었다. 그것은 폭이 대략 1.2미터 깊이가 대략 0.6미터쯤 되어 보이는, 땅 속 ‘틈’을 가로지르며 놓여 있었다. 」 자세한 내용은 ‘25장 #13’을  참조바람)\\n\\u3000조금만 기다리면 이 세상에서 가장 쉬운 방식으로 악수를 나눌 수 있었을 때, 해자(주위를 둘러서 판 못. 웨믹의 집의 경우엔 「 폭이 대략 1.2미터 깊이가 대략 0.6미터 」 임) 건너편에서 나를 보고 손 인사를 저어보이는 웨믹의 모습을 보는 것은 그 어떤 금전적인 가치보다도 내게  가치 있었다.\\n\\u3000도개교(들어 올리는 다리. 사실은 두꺼운 판단 한 짝임)를 들어 올리는 끈을 잡아 내리며 노인장은 너무 즐거워하셨다. 그래서 차마 내가 도와드리고 자시고 할 겨를도  없었다.\\n\\u3000나는 웨믹이 해자(못)를 건너와 내게 스키핀스 양(미스)을 소개해주었을  때까지 조용히 서  있었다. 스키핀스  양은  웨믹이  동반하고 온 숙녀였다.\\n\\u3000스키핀스 양의 겉모습은 이런 말하면 실례지만 나무로 만든 것 같았다. 그리고 그녀를 에스코트하고 있는 연인처럼  그녀도  우체통  입구 같은 입모양을 하고  있었다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 웨믹보다 대략 두세 살이 더 어렸을지도 모른다(모르겠다는 말투죠-_-;; 굳이 이따위로 표현한 디킨스의 의도가 뭘까요?  에스텔라를 더 예쁘게 보이려고???? 역시-_-;; 위대한 소설가든 평범한 사람이든 생각하는 게 똑같군-_-;; 그 나물에 그 밥~,~).\\n\\u3000내가 보건대 그녀는 휴대할 수 있는 재산의 특징을 지니고 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000허리에서부터 위쪽으로, 그리고 앞과 뒷면 모두, 그녀가 입고 있는 드레스의 상의가 그녀의 몸매를 흡사 소년의 연(하늘을 나는 연) 같이 보이게 만들고 있었기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000그리고 나는 하마터면 “그녀의 가운이 좀 너무 튀는 오렌지색 아니에요?” 혹은 “그녀의 장갑이 좀 너무 강렬한 초록색 아니에요?”라고 드러내놓고  말할 뻔했다.\\n\\u3000하지만  그녀는 좋은 사람인 것 같았다. 그리고 연로하신 분을  깍듯이 예우하는 태도를 보였다. 나는 오래 걸리지 않아 그녀가 이 성(웨믹의 집)을 자주 방문함을 눈치 챌 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면, 어쨌든 왜냐하면(이유는 나중에 나옴), 우리가 집안으로 들어갔을 때 내가 웨믹에게 그가 이 독창성이 풍부한 장치를 고안해 아버지가 아실 수 있도록 한 것에 아낌없는 찬사를 보내자, 그가 내게 “그럼 굴뚝 다른 쪽 면에도 살짝 주의를 기울어주실래요?”라며 신신당부하곤 사라지더니 이내 곧 또 다른 “찰칵”하는 소리를 내며 “스키핀스 양”이라고 적혀 있는 작은 나무뚜껑이 텀블링(재주넘기)을 하며 문이 열렸다. 그런 다음엔 “스키핀스 양”의 문이 닫히고 존(웨믹)의 문이 텀블링을 하며 열렸고, 그런 다음엔  스키핀스 양의 문과 존의  문이  함 께 텀블링을 하며 열렸다. 마지막에는 다함께 문이 닫혔다.\\n\\u3000이런 기계적인 장치를 시연해 보인 후 웨믹이 다시 자리로 돌아오자마자, 나는 내가 그 장치들에 얼마나 크게 감탄하며 주의를 기울였는지를 표현했다.\\n그러자  그가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이거 참, 눈치 채셨겠지만 저게 연로하신 아버님에겐 유용하거든요. 아버님이 즐거워하시기도 하고요. 그리고 핍 씨, 정말로! 말씀드릴 수  있는 것은, 이 문으로 오는 모든 사람들 중에서도, 저 손잡이들의 비밀을 알고 있는 사람들은 제 아버님과, 스키핀스 양, 그리고 저 뿐이라는 사실입니다!”\\n\\u3000“그리고 웨믹 씨가 저걸 만드셨죠.” 스키핀스 양이 거들었다. “자기 머리로 꾸며내서 직접 만드신 거예요.”\\n\\u3000스키핀스 양이 보닛(끈을 턱밑으로 묶는 모자. 아기 모자같이 생긴 모자)을 벗는 동안, 그녀는 초록색 장갑을 저녁 내내 끼고 있었는데 그 것은 집(웨믹의 집)에 손님(주인공)이  있다는  외적인  신호이자 가시적 인 표시였다.\\n\\u3000어쨌든 그녀가 보닛(여자모자)을 벗는 동안, 웨믹은  나를 이끌고 집과 정원을 빙 돌며 산보에 나섰다. 그는 지금과 같은 겨울철이면 이 섬(집 주위로 빙 못을 판 웨믹의 집)이 어떻게 보이는지를 내게 보여 주었다.\\n\\u3000내 생각에 이 산보는 그가 내게 ‘월워스(웨믹의 집 주변 지역)에서의 조언’을 구할 수 있게 기회를 준 것이라 여겨졌고, 그래서 난 성(집)을 벗어나자마자 그 기회를 와락 붙잡았다.\\n\\u3000신중히 그 문제(허버트의 사업에 돈을 투자해주는 것)에 대해 생각 해오고 있었기 때문에, 난 마치 내가 이전에는 그 문제에 대해 전혀 기색(기미)을 하지 않았었던 것처럼 그 주제(친구와 돈)로 들어섰다.\\n\\u3000나는 우선 내가 ‘허버트 포킷’(주인공의 절친. 주인공과 허버트 모두 21세임)에게 도움이 되어주기를 간절히 바라고 있다고 앞 뒤 상황설명을 웨믹 씨에게 했다. 그리고 내가 허버트와 처음 어떻게 만나게 되었고, 내가 허버트와 어릴 적에 한 여자애를 놓고 어떻게 싸웠는지 하는 자초지종도  웨믹에게 설명해주었다.\\n\\u3000나는 허버트(주인공의 절친)의 집안 사정과 허버트의 성격(주인공이 돈을 빌려준다고 하면 안 받을 거라는 성격)에 관해서도 대강 설명했다. 그리고 자신의 아버지에게 의지해 받고 있는 수입 외에는 어떤 다른 수입도 그는 현재 가지고 있지 못하며, 아버지에게서 의지해 받고  있는 그 수입이란 것도 실은 불확실하고 제때 들어오는 것이 아님을 설명했다.\\n\\u3000내 고향집을 떠나 이 낮선 런던으로 들어와 미숙하고 무지했던 내 초기 런던생활에 있어서 내가 허버트에게서 어떤 도움을 받았는지도 넌지시 말했다. 그리고 그 모든 도움들에 대해 난 그저 그를 나쁜 길  (돈을 흥청망청 막 쓰기)로 인도했을 뿐이며 아마도 나와 내 막대한 유산만 없었더라도 녀석이 지금보다는 훨씬 더 잘 되어 있었을 수도 있다는  것을 고백했다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴(‘주인공의 고향마을’ ‘인근 읍내’의 어마어마한 갑부)을 전면에 내세우며 말하진 않았지만, 나는 또한 어린 시절에 우리들이 앞날을 놓고 내가 그와 경쟁했었을 가능성이 있다는 사실에 대해서도 넌지시 암시했다. 그리고 허버트가 ‘야비함, 불신, 앙갚음, 계략(계획)’과는 아주 동떨어진 관대한 영혼을 키워왔음이 확실하다는 것도 나는  또한 웨믹에게 넌지시  암시했다.\\n\\u3000내가 지금까지 설명한 이러한 모든 이유들 때문에 그리고 허버트(주인공의 절친)가 내 어린 시절의 동료이자 친구이며 내가 녀석(허버트) 에게 큰 애정을 지니고 있다는 사실 때문에, 나는 내 소유의 행운이 녀석에게도 약간의 빛줄기로 작용하게 되기를 희망하며, 그런 의미에서 이 일의 처리에 관해 내가 ‘사물과 사람들에 대한’ 웨믹 씨의 경험과 지식들에 의지해 조언을 구하고 싶다고 언급했다.\\n\\u3000“어떻게 하면 제  자금들을 최대한  잘 활용해  허버트에게 도움을 줄  수 있을까요? 그러려면 녀석에게 현존하는 수입이 약간이라도 있어야될 텐데? 제 생각으론 1년에 5천만 원 정도면 되지 않을까요? 그 정도 년 수입이면 녀석이 희망을 가지고 명량하게 자신의 일에 매진해나갈 수 있을 것 같은데요. 그렇게 녀석을 돈으로 굴려서 나중엔 어떤 자그마한 사업의 동업자가 될 수 있게 해주고 싶어요.”\\n\\u3000끝으로 나는 “녀석이 알아채거나 의심하는 일 없이 제 도움이 녀석에게 작용했으면 합니다. 그리고 제가 조언을 구할 수 있는 분은 이 세상에서 웨믹 씨 밖에는 그 어떤 누구도 없어요.”라며 웨믹 씨에게 간청했다.\\n\\u3000나는 내 손을 웨믹 씨의 어깨 위에 얹으며 다음과 같이 말하는 것으로 내 이야기의 마무리를 지었다.\\n\\u3000“이번 부탁이 웨믹 씨를 곤란하게 하는 일임은 저도 압니다. 하지만 웨믹 씨에게 속마음을 털어놓을 수밖에 없는 걸요. 따지고 보면 이건  모두 웨믹 씨 탓이기도 하기 때문이에요. 언젠가 절 이곳(집)으로 데리고  오셨었잖아요. 넷!”\\n웨믹이  잠깐  동안  침묵했다.  그런  다음  흠칫  놀란  듯이  말했다. “이거  참,  핍  씨(‘핍’은  주인공이름),  잘  아실  테지만,  당신에게 이\\n한가지만은  꼭  말해야겠습니다.  당신은  몹시도  착한  사람입니다.” “그럼 제가 착한 사람이 될 수 있도록 웨믹 씨가 저를 도와주실 거\\n라고 말씀해주세요. 넷?”라고 내가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“저런,” 웨믹이 고개를 한 번 저으며 말했다. “하지만 제 분야가 아닌걸요.”\\n\\u3000“이곳(웨믹 씨의 정원)도 또한 근무하시는 장소는 아니시죠.”라고 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“맞습니다.” 그가 응답했다. “정곡을 찌르셨군요. 핍 씨(‘핍’은 주인 공이름), 차분히 생각해보겠습니다. 당신이 그를 위해  해주고 싶어하는 일들 모두 서서히 진행될 수 있을 것도 같습니다. 스키핀스 양의 친오빠가 공인 회계사이자 중개상(의뢰를 받아 상행위를 대신해주고 수수료를 받는 상인)이거든요. 제가 그를 한 번 찾아가 그가 당신을 위해 할 수 있는 일들이 있는지 살펴보도록 하겠습니다.”\\n“아세요. 저 감동했어요(ㅜ_ㅜ). 찬만 배 만 만 배나요.”\\n\\u3000“그 반대죠.” 그가 말했다. “제가 더 고마운걸요. 엄밀히 말해 비록 저희가 사적이고 개인적인 지위에 얽혀있다지만, 그럼에도 불구하고 뉴게이트 감옥(런던의 유명한 옛날감옥, 1902에 폐쇄됨. 이 소설은 1861년에 쓰인 것임)의 거미집이 우리 주변에 쳐져 있다는 말이 나올 법도 했는데 이번에 이렇게 말끔히 털어주셨잖습니까.”\\n\\u3000동일한 취지로 좀 더 이야기를 진행시킨 후, 우린(주인공과 웨믹 씨) 성(웨믹의 집) 안으로  돌아갔다.\\n\\u3000집 안에선 스키핀스 양(웨믹의 애인)이  티타임(차  마시기)을 준비하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000토스트(구운 식빵)를 굽는 일은 노인장에게 위임된 상태였다. 이 탁월한 노인장께선 어찌나 토스트 굽기에 열심이신지 나는 순간 ‘저러다 두 눈이 열에 녹아내리시는 건 아냐?’라는 의심까지 품었을 정도였다.\\n\\u3000우리가 차리고 있었던 것은 이름뿐인 식사가 아니었다. 아주 격렬한 실제 상황이었다.\\n\\u3000노인장께서는 ‘버터 바른 토스트’를 마치 건초더미 마냥 준비하셨다. 어찌나 많든지 그 ‘버터 바른 토스트’가 ‘부엌 맨 위’ 막대기 위에 ‘갈고리처럼 걸린’ 쇠 받침대 위로 계속 부글부글 끓고 있었기 때문에 나는 ‘버터 바른 토스트’ 너머로 노인장의 모습을 거의 볼 수 없을 정도 였다.\\n\\u3000한편 스키핀스 양(웨믹의 애인)도 아주 큰 잔에 차를 팔팔 끊이고 있었기 때문에, 집 뒤 우리에  있던  돼지까지 차  냄새에  강하게 흥분해 이 즐거움 속에 자신도 참석하려는 욕망을 “꿀꿀”거리며 되풀이해 표시했을 정도였다.\\n\\u3000마땅한 시각에 ‘유니언 잭(영국국기 이름)’은 지붕 위에서 내려졌고 대포도 발사되었다.\\n\\u3000나는 느껴졌다. 마치 내가 9미터 폭과 9미터 깊이의 해자(건물 주변을 빙 둘러가며 판 못) 안에 있고 월워스(웨믹의 집이 있는 동네이름)의 나머지 지역들로부터 포근하게 차단되어 있는 것처럼 나는 느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000성(웨믹의 집)의 고요함을 깨는 어떤 방해도 없었다.  이따금씩 ‘존 등장’ 그리고 ‘스키핀스 양 등장’이라고 쓰인 작은 나무뚜껑이 텀블링(공중 재주넘기)을 하며 열리는 것만 빼면 말이다.\\n\\u3000이 작은 문들은 어떤 경련성 질환의 희생자들인 것만 같았다. 그 소리에 익숙해질 때까지 나는 동정심이 일어 마음이 불편했다.\\n\\u3000나는 스키핀스 양(웨믹의 애인)이 상을 차리는 방식이 체계적인 것을 보고 그녀가 매주 일요일 밤마다 여기에 들러 차를 준비한다는 사실을 미루어 알 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 그녀가 착용하고 있던 클래식한(고전적인) 브로치(옷에 다는 장식 핀)은 웨믹이 그녀에게 준 휴대할 수 있는 재산의 하나임을 살짝 의심해볼  수도 있었다.\\n\\u3000그 브로치는, 콧날이 아주 바로 서 있는 범죄자 같이 생긴 “여인의 옆얼굴”과 “영락없는 초승달”을 형상화한  브로치였다.\\n\\u3000우리는 토스트(구운 빵)를 모두 먹었다. 그리고 사람 수대로 나눈 차들도  모두 마셨다.\\n\\u3000식사를 마친 후 너무도 기름투성이가 되어 마음이 훈훈해진 서로들의 모습을 보는 것은 몹시 유쾌한 일이었다. 나는 특히 노인장을 이제 막 술에 취한 어떤 야만족의 깔끔한 늙은 추장으로 오인할 뻔했을 정 도니까.\\n\\u3000식사 차리는 것을 도와주던 어린 소녀가 매주 일요일 오후 때면 가족들의 품으로 돌아가 휴식을 취할 때였기 때문에, 약간의 휴식시간을 거친 후, 스키핀스 양이 차(마시는 차)도구들을  씻었다. 그녀는 우리들  중 어느 누구의 품위도 손상시키지 않으면서도 약간은 아마추어 같은 여성스러운 방식으로 우리들이 사용한 차도구들을 씻었다.\\n차(먹는 차) 도구를 모두 씻은 다음 그녀는 다시 장갑을 꼈다. 그리고 우리 모두는 벽난로 가에 둥글게 모여 앉았다.\\n웨믹이 말했다.\\n\\u3000“자, 아버지, 저희들에게 팁으로 신문을 주셔야죠.(← 직역-_-;; / 의  역 → 신문을  읽어주세요)”\\n노인장께서 안경을 꺼내 드시는 동안  웨믹이  내게  설명해주었다. “저희들  습관에  따른  것이지요.  신문기사를  큰  소리로  저희들에게\\n읽어주시는 것을 무한한 기쁨으로 여기시는 분이거든요.”\\n\\u3000“(코믹하게) 사과의 말씀은 안  드릴  거예요(^^),”라며  웨믹이  말했다. “다른 즐거움을 누리실 여유가 없으신 분이니까요.

(아버지를 바라보며) 저희 모두 열심히 귀를 기울이고 있어요,  아버지.”\\n\\u3000“그래 알았다, 존(웨믹), 알았어!”라며 쾌활해진 노인장께서 말씀하셨다. 그는 지금 너무 열심이셨고 또 너무도 만족해하시고 계셨다. 정말 더할 나위 없이 이상적인(아름다운) 광경이었다.\\n\\u3000노인장의 낭독(신문기사 읽기)은 나로 하여금 웹슬 씨(당시 교회서기 지금은 연극배우)의 대고모(대고모 = ‘웹슬 씨의 아버지’의 고모)에서 받았었던 수업들이 기억나게  했다.\\n\\u3000노인장의 낭독에는 열쇠 구멍을 통해 들려오는 것 같은 기분 좋은 특징이 있었다.\\n\\u3000노인장은 양초들을 자신의 가까이에 놓아두고 싶어 했기 때문에, 그리고 그가 매번 머리로든 혹은 들고 있던 신문지로든 간에 양초와 부딪치기 일보직전이셨기 때문에, 우리는 화약 공장을 지키듯 그를 지켜 보아야했다.\\n\\u3000그러나 웨믹(노인장의 아들)도 또한 지치지 않고 조용히 그런 아버지를 지켜보았다. 그리고 노인장은 아주 여러 번이나 자신이 양초와 부딪칠 뻔한 위험을 넘겼음을 전혀 의식하지 않고서도 낭독을 계속할 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000노인장께서 고개를 들어 우리는 보실 때마다 우리 모두는 최대한의 관심과 놀라움을 표현하며 그의 낭독이 다시 시작될 때까지 고개를 끄떡여드렸다.\\n\\u3000웨믹과 스키핀스 양이  나란히  앉았기  때문에,  그리고  내가  그늘이 진 구석에 앉았기 때문에, 나는 웨믹 씨의 입이 서서히 그러면서도 점진적으로 길어지는 것을  목격했다.\\n\\u3000그것은 그가 스키핀스 양의 허리를 감싸 앉으려고 자신의 팔을 서서히 그러면서도 단계적으로 내 뻗고 있음을 강렬히 시사하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000이윽고 나는 그의 손이 스키핀스 양의 다른 쪽으로 나오는 것을 보았다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그 순간 스키핀스 양은 자신의 초록색 장갑으로 보기 좋게 그를 제지하고서는, 마치 그것이(손이) 드레스(드레스  한 점)인양 허리에 감겨 있던 그의 팔을 다시 풀어 매우 신중하게 그녀 앞에 놓인 탁자  위로 올려놓았다.\\n\\u3000스키핀스 양이 이와 같이 행동하는 동안 보인 침착함은 내가 그때까지 본 가장 예사롭지 않은 광경들 중 하나였다.\\n\\u3000그래서 그 행동이 시종일관 정신이 딴 데 팔려 있는 가운데 나온 거라 내가 생각할 수 있었더라면(그렇게 생각 안했다는 의미임), 나는 그녀가 순전히 기계적으로 그렇게 행동했다고 여겼을 것이다(웨믹 씨의 그러한 손버릇이 늘 있는 일임을 곧 알게 되었다는 얘기임).\\n\\u3000머지않아 나는 주목했다. 웨믹의 팔이 또다시 움직이기 시작한 것이다. 그리고 서서히 시야에서 사라지더니, 이내 곧 그의 입이 또다시 헤 벌레해지기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000아주 재미있고 거의 고통을 수반하는 지속적인 긴장감 사이의 휴식기가 내 쪽에서 지나간 다음, 나는 그의 손이 스키핀스 양의 반대쪽에 나타나는  것을 보았다.\\n\\u3000즉시 스키핀스 양이 솜씨 있고 쉽게 동요하지 않는 권투선수인 마냥 그의 손을 제지하더니, 전과 같이 그 ‘허리띠 또는  권투장갑(웨믹의 손)’을 벗어 도로 식탁위로  올려놓았다.\\n\\u3000식탁이 미덕의 길로 향하는 통로를 대변한다면, 노인장의 낭독이 계 속되는 동안 웨믹의 팔은 그 미덕의 길에서 빗나가 있다가 스키핀스 양이 그 손을 도로 미덕의 길로 소환해준 것이라 말해도 정당했다.\\n\\u3000마침내 노인장께서 가벼운 선잠이 드셨다. 이때를 이용해서 웨믹이  작은 주전자 하나와, 잔이 놓인 쟁반 하나와, 윗부분이 자기(도자기 할 때의 ‘자기’)로 된 코르크 마개가 달린 검은 병 하나를 들고 왔다. 그리고 그 술병에는, 술을 마셔서인지 혈색이 좋고 사교적인 용모를 지닌 어떤 성직 고위인사가 그려져 있었다.\\n\\u3000이러한 기구들의 도움을 받아 우리 모두는  따뜻한  뭔가를  마셨다. 물론 노인장께서도 마셨다. 그가 금방 깨어나셨기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000스키핀스 양이 그것을 섞었다. 그리고 그녀가 웨믹과 같은 잔으로 마시는 것을 나는  목격했다.\\n\\u3000물론 스키핀스 양을 그녀의 집까지 바래다주겠다고 제안할 만큼 나는 어리석진 않았다. 그리고 이 상황에서는 내가 먼저 귀가해야한다는 사실 또한 나는 잘 알고 있었다. 실제로도 나는 그렇게 행동했다. 노인 장과 진심에서 우러난 작별인사를 나눈 후, 나는 이 기분 좋았던 저녁 식사 자리에서 먼저  퇴장했다.\\n1주일이 다 가기도 전에, 나는 웨믹으로부터 메모 한 장을 받았다. 날짜  란에  월워스(웨믹이  사는  동네이름)라고  적힌  그  메모는 이렇게  시작되고 있었다.\\n\\u3000〈 우리의 개인적이고 사적인 관계와 연관된 그 문제에 있어서 제가 약간의 진전을 이루었다고 생각됩니다. 그래서 말인데, 당신께서 이 문제로 저를 다시 찾아와 만나주신다면 저는 그것을 기쁨으로 알 것입니다.〉\\n\\u3000그래서 나는 월워스(웨믹이 사는 동네이름)로 다시 한 번 찾아갔고, 그럼에도 불구하고 2차로 다시 한 번 더 찾아갔고, 그럼에도 불구하고 3차로 다시 한 번 더 찾아갔으며, 런던시티(금융가)에서도 몇 차례 약속을 잡고 그를  만났다.\\n\\u3000하지만 ‘리틀 브리튼’(웨믹의 직장이 있는 거리이름. 런던 북서쪽에 있는 거리이름임)에서나 또는 그 근처에서는 그 주제에 관해 나는 웨믹과 그 어떤 대화도 하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000마침내, 우리는 어느 젊고 훌륭한  상인내지는 선박중개인을 발견할 수 있었다. 그 사람은 이 업계에 뛰어 던지 얼마 되지  않았는데 지적인 도움과 자본 그리고 시간과 수익의 필연적인 결과로써 파트너도 한 명 구할 생각을 지닌 그러한 인물이었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 그와 나는 허버트(주인공의 절친)를 주체로 한 비밀 협정에 서명했다. 나는 그에게 1억 2천 5백만 원을 계약금조로 그 자리에서 지불했고 다른 몇 가지의 지급 약속에도 서명해주었다. 어떤 지불 약속에는 지불 기일을 특정한 날짜로 잡아 내 수입에서 주기로 했으며, 또 어떤 지불 약속에서는 내가 유산을 물려받자마자 지정된 금액을 분 담하는  것으로 체결했다.\\n\\u3000스키핀스 양(웨믹의 애인)의 친오빠(공인 회개사)가 이 교섭을 진행 했다.\\n\\u3000웨믹은 처음부터 끝까지 이 교섭이 잘 이루어지도록 관여했다. 하지    만 교섭에 절대 모습을 드러내진 않았다.\\n\\u3000이 전체 업무가 너무도  빈틈없이 처리되었기 때문에 허버트(주인공의 절친)는 내 손이 거기까지 미쳤다는 것을 전혀 의심하지 못했다.\\n\\u3000언젠가 오후에 집으로 귀가한 허버트가 대단한 한 건의 뉴스라며 “헤비급 뉴스가 있어, 헨델. 클래리커(남자이름. 소설 속 엑스트라임. 독자가 이름 알 필요 없음)란 어느 상인과 만났는 그가 글쎄 내게 어 마어마한 관심을 보이지 뭐니, 마침내 내 앞길에 광명이 비추어질 것 같아.”와 같이 말하면서 온 얼굴이 자체발광 빛나던 모습을 나는 아무리 시간이 지난다 해도 잊을 수 없으리라.\\n\\u3000그의 희망이 나날이 현실이 되어갔고 그의 얼굴이 나날이 빛이 나기 시작했기 때문에, 그는 갈수록 더 내가 애정이 넘치는 친구라고 생각했음일 틀림없다. 왜냐하면 녀석이 아주 행복해하는 모습을 볼 때 난 흘러내리는 환희의 눈물을 억제하고 있기가 가장 힘들었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000한참 있다가, 그 일이 마무리 되고, 그리고 그 날 허버트가 ‘클래리 커(사람이름) 회사’에 입사를 했을 때, 그리고 기쁨과 성공감에 넘쳐 녀석이 온 저녁동안 내게 떠들어댔을 때, 내 유산으로 누군가에게 어떤 선의의 행동을 했다는 생각에 나는 잠자리에 들었을 때 정말이지 진정으로 울었다.\\n\\u3000내 인생에 있어서의 일대 대사건, 내 삶의 ‘터닝 포인트’(전환점)가  이제 그 모습을 드러내고  있다.\\n\\u3000하지만, 이 이야기를 계속 이어가기 전에, 그리고 그와 뒤얽힌 모든 변화들로 옮겨가기 전에, 나는 하나의 장(38장 전체)을 에스텔라에게 할애해야한다(떼어주다).\\n\\u3000그것은 내 심장을 오랫동안 짓눌려왔던 주제에게  기부하기에  그리 많은  분량은  못 된다.\\n\\n\\u3000(여기까지가 37장 끝입니다. 이어지는 이야기는 38장에서 계속 됩니다.)

것일  게다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 그곳에 머무는 동안, 아, 많고 많은 밤과  낮  전부를 내 안에 있던 동요하는 영혼이 그 집을 괴롭혔던가!\\n\\u3000내 영혼이 그 집 주변을 언제까지나 배회하게 되고 종잡지 못해 헤매듯 방랑하더라도 부디 거기가 내 몸이 머물 곳이니 내 몸을 거기에 있게 허락해주시길.\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 함께 지내고 있는 귀부인의 이름은 ‘브랜들리’ 부인(소설  속 엑스트라임. 독자들이 기억할 필요가 없는 이름임)이었다. 미망인 (과부)이었다. 그녀는 에스텔라보다 몇 살 더 많은 외동딸(소설 속 엑스트라임. 이름 몰라도 됨)이 한 명 있었다.\\n어머니는 젊어보였고 딸은 나이 들어보였다.\\n\\u3000어머니의 얼굴 피부색은 연분홍색이었는데 딸의 얼굴 피부색은

모녀가 필요하다는 이해가 맞아떨어졌을 뿐이다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴(주인공 시골 인근 읍내 외곽에 사는 어마어마한 갑부. 에스탈라를  낳지는  않았지만  거두어  길러준  수양어머니임)이  은둔의 시기에 들기 전까지, 브랜들리 부인은 미스 해비샴의 친구였었다. \\n\\u3000브랜들리 부인(에스텔라의 하숙집 여주인)의 집 안에서 그리고 브랜들리 부인의 집 밖에서도, 나는 에스텔라가 내게 야기 시키는 모든  종류와 모든 강도의 고문을 다 겪었다.\\n\\u3000그녀와의 관계의 특성상 나는 내 자신을 호의의 조건에 두지도 못하면서 친밀하게만 지내고 있었다. 그것은 내 정신이 하나도 없게 만들었다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 다른 구혼자들을 애 달게 만드는데 나를 이용했다. 그녀는 자신과 나 사이의 친밀함을, 그녀에 대한 내 헌신을 끊임없이 모욕하는  데에 사용했다.\\n\\u3000내가 만일 그녀의 비서였었다면, 집사였었다면, 어머니가 다른 오빠 였더라면, 아님 가난한 친척이었더라면, 그도 아니면 내가 만일 그녀가 결혼할 남편의 남동생이었더라면, 내가 그녀와 가장 가까워진 바로 그 때에도, 그녀를 향한 내 희망들은 더 줄어들진 않았을 텐데.\\n\\u3000사정이 그러했으므로, 그녀의 이름을 부를 수 있다는 특권과 그녀가 내 이름을 부르는 것을 들을 수 있다는 특권은 내 시련을 더 악화시키고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 내 특권(그녀의 이름을 부를 수 있고 자신의 이름을 그녀가 부르는 것)이 그녀의 다른 구혼자들을 거의 미치게 한 것이 있을 법한 일이었음에 비해, 그 특권이 나를 거의 미치게 했던 것은 너무도 확실 했다.\\n\\u3000그녀에겐 끝도 없이 구혼자들이 달라붙었다. 의심할 바 없이 나는 질투심 때문에 그녀에게 접근하는 모든 이들을 구혼자로 여겼다. 하지만 내가 그러지 않아도 구혼자들이라면 지긋지긋하게 널려 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그녀를 ‘리치먼드(런던 내에서 가장 부유한 동네, 에스텔라가 머물고 있는 동네)’에서 종종 만났다. 나는 시내에서 그녀에 대한 소문을 자주 접했다. 나는  종종  템스 강으로  그녀와  브랜들리 모녀를 데리고  가곤 했다.\\n\\u3000피크닉(소풍)들에서든, 야외에서 이루어진 축제들에서든, 연극들에서 든, 오페라들에서든, 콘서트들에서든, 파티들에서든, 모든 종류의 즐거 움들에서든 나는 그녀를  쫓아다녔다.\\n그리고 그 모든 것들이 나를 비참하게 만들었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그녀가 만들어 놓은 어울림(교제) 속에서 단 한 시간도 행복감을 가져본 적이 없었다. 그럼에도 불구하고 내 정신은 그녀가 죽을 때까지 나와 함께 지낼 거라는 행복에 대해 24시간 내내 계속해서 지껄 여대고 있었다.\\n\\u3000곧 드러나다시피 우리의 교류(←원문에 ‘교제’라고 쓰여 있지 않음)는 오래갔다. 굳이 오래갔다고 말한 것은 그 당시에 적어도 내가 그렇게  생각했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000우리 교류의 이러한 부분 처음부터 끝까지 그녀는 습관적으로 “우리의 교제(←원문에 ‘교제’라고 쓰여 있음)는 우리에게 강요된 것”임을 나타내는 말투로 되돌아가 얘기하곤  했다.\\n\\u3000또 다른 때에는 이러한 말투나 그녀의 수많은 말투들로 얘기하는 것을 갑작스레 억제하고는 나를 불쌍히 여기는 것 같을 때도 있었다.\\n\\u3000“핍(주인공의 이름, 21세), 핍.” 어느 날 저녁 그녀가 앞서 말한 그 갑작스런 억제력을 발휘하면 말했다. 그때는 우리가 ‘리치먼드(런던 내에서 가장 부유한 동네, 에스텔라가 머물고 있는 동네)’에 있는 그녀의 집 어두운 창가에서 떨어져 않아 있을 때였다.\\n(에스텔라의 대사→) “너는 경고를 듣지 않으려는 거니?” (주인공의 대사→) “무슨  경고?”\\n(에스텔라의 대사→) “나에 대한 경고 말이야.”\\n\\u3000(주인공의 대사→) “너에게 매혹되어서는 안 된다는 경고 말이니, 에 스텔라?”\\n\\u3000(에스텔라의 대사→) “다시 말할게! 만일 네가 지금 내가 하는 말의 의미를 이해하지 못한다면, 넌 눈이 먼 거야.”\\n\\u3000나는 사랑은 흔히  눈을 멀게  한다고 말했어야  했는데…. 하지만 내가 그때 느낀 감정은 비참함과는 거리가 있었는데, 그건 그녀가 미스 해비샴에게 복종하는 것 외에는 달리 선택할 수 있는 게 없다는 사실을 그녀가 알고 있는데도 불구하고 내가 내 자신을 그녀에게 강요하는 것은 관대하지 않다는 감정이 들었기 때문이다. 그것은 또한 내가 에 스텔라를 대할 때 나를 항상 내리누르던 감정이기도 했다.\\n내 불안은 항상 다음의 두 가지였다.\\n\\u3000그녀의 역할에 대해 내가 안다는 것이 내가 그녀의 자존심을 대할 때 항상 내 자신을 대단히 불리한 상황에 두었다는 것과, 그리고 그것이 그녀 마음속에 나라는 존재를 바동거리며 반항해야할 대상으로 삼게 만들진 않았는지이다.\\n\\u3000“어쨌든,”이라며 내가 말했다. “난, 지금 당장은 어떠한 경고도 네게서 받지 않은 거야, 왜냐하면 편지를 보내 이리로 오라고 한 건 너였 으니까, 지금 이 시각에  말이야.”\\n\\u3000“그래 맞아.”  에스텔라가 항상 나를 오싹하게 만드는 예의 그 차갑고 애정 없는 미소를 지어며 말했다.\\n\\u3000땅거미가 지고 주변이 완전히 어두워가는 모습을 잠깐 동안 지켜본 후 그녀가 이야기를  계속했다.\\n\\u3000“새티스(미스 해비샴의 집)에서 미스 해비샴이 나와 하루 동안 지내길 희망하는 날이 다시 돌아오고 있어. 말하자면, 네가 날 그곳까지 데려다 주어야 한다는 거야. 런던으로 되돌아올 때도 마찬가지고. 미스 해비샴은 나 혼자서 여행하는 걸 싫어하거든. 그리고 내 심부름꾼 여자아이가 나를 따라 그곳까지 가는 것도 극구 반대하시고. 그런 사람  들의 구설수에 오르는 것을 예민할 정도로까지 끔찍해하시니까. 어떠니 나를 데려다줄 수 있겠니?”\\n“내가 너를 데려다 줄 수 있겠니라니, 에스텔라!”\\n\\u3000“그럼 데려다줄 수 있다는 거지? 너만 좋다면 모레(내일의 다음날)  내려 갈까하는데. 넌 이번  여행경비를  내  지갑에서  꺼내  지불해주면 돼. 그게 네가 가는 조건이니까, 알았지?”\\n“시키는 대로 해야 하는 거지.” 내가 말했다. \\n\\u3000이것이 다였다. 내가 그 방문을 위해 들었던 준비 전부였으니까. 왜냐하면 다른 방문 때도 그와 똑같은 말을 들었었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴은 결코 내게 직접 편지를 쓰지 않았다. 물론 나는 이전에도 그녀의 손 글씨를 본 적이 없었다(나중에는 한 번 써주더라는 얘기겠죠. 왜일까요? 왜???  ^0^).\\n우리는 ‘그 다음다음 날’(=모레) 내려갔다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴은 내가 그녀를 처음 접했던 그 방에 그대로 있었다. 또한 ‘새티스 하우스’(미스 해비샴의 대저택 이름)에 어떠한 변화도 없더라는 말을 덧붙이는 것도  불필요했다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴은, 내가 그녀와 에스텔라가 함께 있는 모습을 마지막으로 보았을 때보다 훨씬 더 에스텔라를 좋아했다. 나는 ‘좋아했다’라는 이 단어를 의도적으로 반복한다. 왜냐하면 미스 해비샴의 표정과 포옹에는 명백히도 끔찍스러운 에너지 같은 무엇인가가 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 에스텔라의 아름다움에 빠져 있었다. 그녀는 에스텔라의 말들에 열중했고, 그녀는 에스텔라의 몸짓들에 구애했다. 에스텔라가 자신을 바라다보고 있는 동안에도 그녀(미스 해비샴)는 자신의 떨리는 손가락들을 우물우물 씹으며 앉아  있었다.\\n\\u3000그건 마치 미스 해비샴이, 그녀(미스 해비샴) 자신이 길러낸 이 아름다운 창조물을 게걸스럽게 먹어치우고 있는 것만 같이 보였다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴이 에스텔라에게서 눈을 떼 나를 바라다보았다. 그 눈빛은 내 심장을 캐서 내 심장의 상처들을 철저히 조사하려는 것만 같은 탐문하는 눈빛이었다.\\n\\u3000“그래 핍(주인공이름, 21세) 저 애가 너를  어떻게  이용하더냐?  저 애가 널 어떻게  이용해?”\\n\\u3000그녀가  마녀 같은  열성으로 내게 묻고 또 물었다. 심지어 에스텔라가 그 옆에서 듣고  있었음에도.\\n\\u3000하지만 밤에 우리가 깜박거리는 벽난로 옆에 자리를 잡고 앉았을 때야말로 그녀가 가장 섬뜩해보이던  때였으리라.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 그때, 미스 해비샴은 에스텔라의 손을  자신의  팔로  칭칭 감싸 손으로 움켜쥐고는, 에스텔라가 정기적인 편지로 그동안 써 보냈었던 “에스텔라에게 매료되었었던 남성들의 이름들과 상태들”에 대해 다시 언급하게 함으로써 에스텔라를 갈취하고 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000죽을 정도로 마음의 상처를 입고, 병에 걸린 것만 같은  강렬함으로  미스 해비샴은 이 명부(=두루마리=편지)를 곱씹는 동안, 다른 손으로 자신의 목발 지팡이(=목발=지팡이)를 짚은 채, 그  지팡이  위에  턱을 괴고 앉은 채, 자신의 비정상적으로 창백하고 빛나는 그 두 시선으로  나를 노려보며 앉아 있었다. 마치 유령처럼.\\n\\u3000나는 이 모든 것을 지켜보았다. 그것이 나를 더 비참하게 만들었다. 그리고 그것이 일깨우는 예속감과 심지어 내 지위가 강등당하는 느낌은  너무 쓰라렸다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 모든 것을 지켜보았다. 미스 해비샴이 남자들에게 복수를 가하기 위해 에스텔라를 준비해왔었다는 것을. 그리고 그 조건을 만족할 때까지 미스 해비샴은 에스텔라를 내게 보내주지 않을 것임을.\\n\\u3000나는 이 모든 것을 이해했다. 내가 왜 사전에 에스텔라를 만날 수 있었는지를.\\n\\u3000남자들을 매혹시키고 고통을 준 후 차버리기 위해 에스텔라를 세상 밖으로 내보냈을 때, 미스 해비샴은 “에스텔라가 모든 구혼자들의 손에 닿는 그 너머에 있으며 그녀의 애인이 되기 위해 뛰어든 모든 남성들이 결국 패자가 될 것”이란 악의적인 확신을 가진 채 그녀는 에스텔 라를 세상 밖으로 내보낸  것이다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 모든 것을 이해했다. 나도 역시 이 왜곡된 재간(재주)에 고통을 당했다는 것을. 내가 심지어 그 상을 받도록 보장되어 있음에도 불구하고.\\n\\u3000나는 이 모든 것을 이해했다. 내 일이 왜 이토록 오랫동안 늦추어져 왔는지를. 그리고 내 최근의 후견인(재거스 변호사)이 그러한 계획을 인지했음을 공식적으로 실토하기를 거부하고  있었는지를.\\n\\u3000한 마디로 말해,  나는 즉시  내 앞에 앉아 있는 미스 해비샴의 실체에 대해  모든 것을 파악했다. 그것은  항상 내가 이 두  눈으로 받아오던 느낌이었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 나는 분명히 보았다. 그녀의 삶을 태양으로부터 은폐시키고  있는  거무스름하고  건강하지  못한  ‘새티스  저택’(미스  해비샴의 저택이름)의 그 뚜렷한 그림자를. \\n\\u3000미스 해비샴의 방에 불빛을 비추고 있던 양초들은 벽에서 쑥 내민 돌출 촛대(양초 꽂이)들에 꽂혀 있었다.\\n\\u3000촛불들은 바닥에서 높이 있었다. 좀처럼 환기되지 않는 공기 속에서 그 촛불들은 흔들림 없고 울적한 빛을 부자연스럽게 방에 비추고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 고개를 돌려 촛불들을 둘러보았다. 그것들이 만든 희미한 어둠도 둘러보았다. 멈춘 시계는 예전 그대로였다. 테이블에서부터 바닥에 걸쳐 있는 빛이 바랜 신부용 드레스도 둘러보았다. 벽난로의 유령 같은 빛에 반사된 나머지 방의 천장과 벽에 거대한 그림자를 던지고 있는 그녀 자신의 끔찍한 모습에도 나는 고개를 돌려 둘러보았다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 모든 것들에서 내 마음이 받아들인 그 해석(끔찍함)이  되풀이 되어 나에게로 되던져지는 것을 보았다.\\n\\u3000내 생각들은, 테이블이 널찍이 자리 잡고 있는 층계참(위층으로 가는 계단과 아래층으로 가는 계단 사이에 있는 공간)의 맞은편에 있는 그 거대한 방의 일부가 되었다. 그리고 나는 그 방에서 내 해석(끔찍함)이 역력히 드러나 있는 것을 보았다.\\n\\u3000이를 테면, 식탁 중앙에 놓은 장식물에 쳐져  있는 거미줄이 늘어져  있는 모습들 속에서, 식탁보 위에 있는 거미들의 우글거림들 속에서, 칸막이벽들 뒤에서 빠르게 뛰고 있는 작은 심장들을 호소하듯 움직이고 있는 쥐들의 발자국들 속에서, 그리고 바닥 위에 있는 딱정벌레들이 이리저리 손을 더듬다 멈췄다하는 그 모습들 속에 나는 내 해석(끔 찍함)이 역력히 드러나 있는 것을 보았다.\\n\\u3000이 방문에 즈음해서 화가 나서 하는 몇몇 말들이 에스텔라와 미스 해비샴의 사이에서 오고가는 일이 발생했다.\\n그들이 대립하는 것을 본 것은 그 때가 처음이었다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 조금씩 미스 해비샴에게서 벗어나려 하기 시작했을 때,  우리 셋은 벽난로 가 옆에 앉아 있었고 방금 전에 설명한 것처럼 미스 해비샴은 여전히 에스텔라의 팔을 자신의 팔로 칭칭 감싼 후 에스텔라의 손을 자신의 손으로 움켜쥐고 있었었다.\\n\\u3000앞서, 에스텔라는 몇 번이고 거만한 짜증스러움을 드러냈었다. 에스텔라는 미스 해비샴의 사나운 애착을 받아주고 그녀의 질문에 대답하느니 차라리 그 사나운 애착을 참고 견디고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“뭬야!” 미스 해비샴의 눈에서 섬광이 일며 말했다. “그래서, 내게 싫증난 거냐?”\\n\\u3000“제 자신에게 조금 지쳤을 뿐이에요.” 에스텔라가 미스 해비샴의 팔에서 몸을 떼며 말했다. 에스텔라는 거대한 ‘벽난로 위 선반’쪽으로 걸어갔다. 그곳에서 그녀는 벽난로 불빛을 내려다보며 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000“사실대로 말해 보거라, 이 배은망덕한 것아!”라며 미스 해비샴이 자신의 지팡이로 바닥을 격렬하게 내리치면서 소리쳤다. “넌 내게 싫증난 게야.”\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 조금도 동요하지 않고 미스 해비샴을 쳐다보았다. 그리고 다시 벽난로 불빛을 내려다보았다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라의 우아한 모습과 아름다운 얼굴에는 상대방의 사나운 열기에 대한 거의 잔인할 정도로까지 냉정한 무관심이 드러나 있었다.\\n\\u3000“이 목석(나무나 돌 같이 감정이 없는 사람) 같은 것아!”라며 미스 해비샴이 소리쳤다. “이 매정한 것!”\\n\\u3000“뭐라고요?” 에스텔라가 큰 ‘벽난로 위 선반’에 기댄 체 눈만 움직이며 예의 그 무관심한 태도를 계속 견지하면서 말했다. “제 마음이 차갑다고 질책하시는 건가요?  어머니께서요?”\\n“그럼 아니란 말이냐?” 통렬한 반박이 잇따랐다.\\n\\u3000“어머니께서는 아셔야 해요,” 에스텔라가 말했다. “절 이렇게 키운  분이 어머니시란 것을요. 모든 칭찬도 모든 비난도 모든 성공과 실패도 모두 가져가시란 말이에요. 다시 말해 절 받아들이시라고요.”\\n\\u3000“오, 저 애 좀 보거라, 저 애 좀 봐!” 미스 해비샴이 심하게 울부짖으며 말했다. “저 매정하고 감사할 줄 모르는 아이를 보거라, 그것도 자신이 양육된 벽난로 바닥 위에서! 버려져  생애  첫 피를  흘리고 있을 때 내가 저것을 이 불행한 가슴으로  받아들였던  이 장소에서,  내 애정 을 저를 위해 수년 동안 아낌없이 쏟아 부었던 이 장소에서!”\\n\\u3000“적어도 전 그 협정의 어떠한 당사자도 아니었어요.” 에스텔라가 말했다. “그 협정이 맺어질 때, 전 너무 어려 말하고 걷는 것조차 힘들었을 테니까요. 하지만 어머니가 그 작은 애였더라면 어떻게 하셨을 것 같으세요? 어머닌 제게 잘해주셨어요. 그리고  전  어머니에게  모든  것 을 빚지고 있죠. 자 그럼 어머닌 제게서 무엇을 가지고 싶으세요?”\\n“사랑이다.” 상대방이 대답했다. “어머닌 사랑을 받고  계세요.”\\n“난 받고 있지 않다.” 미스 해비샴이 말했다. \\n\\u3000“(차분한 목소리로) 수양어머니(=낳지는 않았지만 길러준 어머니).” 느긋하고 우아한 자신의 태도에서 조금도 벗어나지 않은 채, 상대방처럼 목소리를 높이는 일도 전혀 없이, 분노에도 애정에도 전혀 굴복하지 않은 채 에스텔라가  쏘아붙였다.\\n\\u3000“수양어머니, 제 모든 것을 어머니께 빚지고 있다고 말씀드리잖아요. 제가 소유한 모든 것이 솔직히 어머니 것이에요. 제게 주셨던 모든 것들을 말 한마디면 도로 가져가실 수 있으시잖아요. 그  이상, 전  아무  것도 소유하고 있지 않아요. 그리고 만약 어머니께서 결코 제게 주신  적이 없는 것을 달라고 하신다면, 제가 아무리 어머님께 감사함과 의무를 느낀다 하더라도 그건 저도 어쩔 수 없는 일이람 말이에요.”\\n\\u3000“내가 저(에스텔라)에게 사랑을 준 적이 없다니!” 미스 해비샴이 미친 듯 내 쪽으로 고개를 돌리며 외쳤다. “내가 저(에스텔라)에게 열렬한 모정을 준 적이 없다니, 질투와 분리할 수 없고 날카로운 통증과도 떼려야뗄 수 없었던 열렬한 모정을 내가 저에게 준 적이 없다니, 저것이 내게 이와 같이 말하다니! 저 애보고 나를 미쳤다고 부르게 해라, 저 애더러 내가 제정신이 아니라고 말하게 해!”\\n (빵실~빵실~해석 잘 되네~ㅋ)\\n\\u3000“제가 왜 어머니에게 그런  소리를  해야  돼요?” 에스텔라가 대답했다. “하고 많은 사람들 중에 왜 제가요? 어머니께서 확고한 목적들을 지니고 계시다는 것을 저의 반만큼이라도 알고 있는 사람이 어디 있다고 그러세요? 어머니께서 어떤 흔들림 없는 기억을 가지고 계시다고는 사실을 제가 아는 반만큼이라도 아는 이가 어디에 있다고 이러세요? 심지어 거기 어머니 옆에 지금도 놓여 있는 그 자그마한 의자(등받이나 손잡이가 없는 의자) 위에, 이 벽난로 바닥 위에 앉아서, 어머님의 얼굴이 낯설고 저를 겁먹게 하셨을 적에도 어머님의 가르침을 받아들이며 당신의 얼굴을 빤히 쳐다보며 자란 애가 저 아닌 가요!”\\n\\u3000“벌써 다 잊다니!” 미스 해비샴이 신음 소리를 내며 말했다. “그 때를 벌써 다  잊다니!”\\n\\u3000“아녜요, 전 잊지 않았어요.” 에스텔라가 반박했다. “아무 것도 잊지 않았어요, 단지 제 기억 속에 소중히 간직해두었을 뿐이에요. 제가 언제 어머니의 가르침에 충실하지 않았던 적이 있었나요? 제가 언제 어머님의 말씀을 잊은 적이 있던가요? 어머님께서 배척하셨던 어떤 것이든,” 에스텔라가 자신의 손을 가슴에 대었다. “어머니께서 배척하셨던  그 어떤 것이든 제가 여기(심장)에 들이는 것을 보신 적이 있나요? 제게 진실해지세요.”\\n\\u3000“저 거만한 것, 저 거만한 것!” 미스 해비샴이 자신의 두 손으로 자신의 회색 머리카락을 옆으로 밀어젖히며 신음소리를 냈다.\\n\\u3000“누가 절 이토록 거만하게 가르쳤던가요?” 에스텔라가 쏘아붙였다. “제가 어머니의 가르침을 하나씩 익혀나갈 때마다 절 칭찬해주셨던 분이 누구였던가요?”\\n\\u3000“저 거만한 것, 저 거만한 것!” 미스 해비샴이 앞서와 같은 그 동작 (머리카락 옆으로 밀어젖히기)을 하며 신음소리를 냈다.\\n\\u3000“누가 절 이토록 매정하도록  가르치셨던가요?”  에스텔라가  대꾸했다. “제가 어머니의 가르침을 하나씩 익혀나갈 때마다 절 칭찬해주셨던  분이 누구였냐고요?”\\n\\u3000“아니 내게 이토록 거만하고 매정하게 굴다니!” 미스 해비샴이 자신의 두 팔을 내뻗으며 완전히 새된 목소리로 비명을 질러댔다. “에스텔라, 에스텔라, 에스텔라, 내게 이토록 거만하고 매정하게 굴다니!”\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 잠시 동안 경이로울 정도로까지 침착한 태도로 미스 해비샴을 쳐다보았다. 하지만 에스텔라는 동요하지는 않았다.  잠시 시간이 더 흐른 후, 에스텔라가  다시 고개를  돌려 벽난로  불을 내려다보았 다.\\n\\u3000“전 모르겠어요,”라며 잠시 침묵을 더 지키던 에스텔라가 시선을 들면서 말했다. “한동안 떨어져 있다 어머니를 만나러 돌아온 제게 왜 그렇게 불합리하셔야 해요. 저는 어머니가 당하신 잘못들과 원인들을 한시도 잊은 적이 없어요. 전 어머니와 어머니의 교육 어느 것에 대해 서도 결코 충실하지 못했던 적이 없었단  말이에요.  저는  책잡힐만한 어떤 약점도 보인 적이  없어요.”\\n\\u3000“내 사랑에 대한 네 보답이 기껏 ‘책잡히지 않은 것’이더냐?” 미스 해비샴이 소리 질렀다. “아니 그래, 그렇지, 저 아인 사랑을 ‘책잡히지 않는 거’라 말하곤  했었지!”\\n\\u3000“전 이제,” 에스텔라가 다시 한 번 경이로울 정도의 침착함을 보이더니 생각에 잠긴 태도로 이렇게 말했다. “전 이제 이번 일이 어떻게해서 벌어진 일인가를 거의 이해했다는 생각이 들기 시작했어요. 만일 어머니께서 양녀(딸)를 들이셔서 이 거무스름한 방들에 완전히 감금한 채 햇빛에 비친 어머니의 얼굴을 단 한 번도 본 적이 없거니와 그런  비슷한 것이 있다는 사실 조차 모르게 키우셨다면…, 만약 어머니께서 그렇게 완수하시고, 그런 다음 어떤 목적에서 그 여자애보고 햇빛을 이해하길 바란다거나 햇빛에 대한 모든 것을 알길 바란다면, 그게 어머니께서 실망하시고 화내실 일인 건가요?”\\n\\u3000두 손으로 머리를 감싸 앉은 미스 해비샴이 낮은 신음 소리를 내며 앉아 자신의 몸을 전후좌우로 흔들고 있었다. 하지만 에스텔라의 질문엔 어떤 답도 하지  않았다.\\n\\u3000“그렇지 않다면,” 에스텔라가 잠시 뜸을 들인 후 말했다. “이게 더 밀접한 경우겠지만…, 만약 그 애의 지능이 막 태동했을 때부터 어머니께서 그 애를 최대한의 에너지와 의도를 담아 다음과 같이 가리켰다면, 햇빛 같은 것이 존재하기는 하지만, 그것은 그 애의 적이며 파괴자가 될 예정으로 만들어졌다고, 그리고 햇빛이 어머니를 상처 냈기 때  문에 이제 그 애에게도 상처를 입힐 거라며 그 애보고 햇빛에게서 등을 돌려야 된다고 가리켰다면…,” 에스텔라는 여기서 한 번 뜸을 들인 후 계속 이야기를 이어갔다. “만약 어머니께서 그렇게 완수하셨고, 그런 다음 어떤 목적에서 그 여자애가 햇빛을 자연스럽게 받아들이길 원하셨는데 만일 그 여자애가 그러질 못하더라면, 그럼 그게 어머니께서 실망하시고 화내실 일인 건가요?”\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴은 경청하며 앉아 있었다. 그렇지  않다면  경청하는 척 했을 것이다. 왜냐하면 그때 난 미스 해비샴의 얼굴을 볼 수 없었기 때문이다. 하지만 미스 해비샴은 여전히 어떠한 대답도 하지 않고 있 었다.\\n\\u3000“그러니까,”라며 에스텔라가 말했다. “제가 만들어진 대로 받아들이셔야 해요. 성공이 제 성공이 아니듯, 실패가 제 실패가 아니 듯이요.  단지 이 두 가지가 함께 저를 만든 것일 뿐이에요.”\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴은 바닥 위에, 흩뿌려져 있고 색이 바란 신부용 유품들 사이에 조용히 자리 잡고 앉아 있었다. 난 그녀가 어떻게 그 자세를 취했는지  알지 못했다.\\n\\u3000나는 그 순간을 이용해서, 손짓을 해 에스텔라에게 미스 해비샴의 주의를 끌어달라고 간청한 후 그 방을 나섰다. 처음부터 난 그 기회를 찾고 있었었다.\\n\\u3000내가 방을 떠날 때, 꼭 처음부터 끝까지 거기에 서 있었던 것처럼 에스텔라는 그 거대한 벽난로 선반 가(옆)에 여전히 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴의 회색  머리카락들은  어찌할  바를  몰라  바닥  위에서, 또 다른 신부용 유물들 사이에서 표류하고 있었다. 그건 보기에도 비참한 광경이었다.\\n\\u3000우울한 마음이었다. 한 시간 혹은 그 이상을 나는 별빛 속에서 안마당 여기저기를 걸었다. 맥주공장 주변도 걸었다. 폐허가 된 정원 주변도 걸었다.\\n\\u3000마침내 내가 용기를 내 방으로 돌아왔을 때 나는 에스텔라가 미스 해비샴의 무릎 앞쪽에 앉아 조각조각 떨어져 가는 낡은 드레스 중 하나를 바늘로 꿰매어 깁고 있는 모습을  보았다. 그 이후 죽 색이 바란  넝마 옷 같은 낡은 현수막들이 대성당에 걸려 있는 모습을 볼 때면 나는 종종 당시 에스텔라가 바늘로 꿰매고 있던 이 낡은 드레스가 떠올 려지곤 했다.\\n\\u3000나중에 에스텔라와 나는 종전과 같이 카드놀이를 했다. 이제는 우리 모두 카드놀이에 능숙했다. 그리고 우리는 프랑스 게임들을 했다(에스텔라는 프랑스로 숙녀교육을 다녀왔음). 그렇게 저녁은 차츰 닳아 없어 졌고 나는 침대에 들었다(잠을 잤다).\\n\\u3000나는 안마당 건너편에 따로 떨어져 있는 건물에서 늦게야 잠자리에 들었다. 처음이었다. 내가 ‘새티스 하우스’(미스 해비샴의 저택 이름)에서 자는 건. 그래서인지 쉽사리 잠들지 못하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 천명의 미스 해비샴에게 시달렸다. 그녀는 내가 벤 베게 이 쪽 위에, 저 쪽 위에, 그리고 베개 머리맡과 베개 발치에, 반쯤 열려 있던   옷 방(주인공 방의 옷 방) 문 뒤편에도 있었다. 그리고 머리 위에 있는 방에도 그녀는 있었고, 머리 아래에 있는 방에도 그녀는… 내 생각이 미치는 모든 곳에 그녀의 흔적은 있었다.\\n\\u3000밤이 새벽 2시를 향해 속도를 늦추며 기어가고 있을 때,  마침내  나는 이 방은 누워 잘 방으론 더 이상 적합하지 않다는 확신이 들어 일어나야겠다고 생각했다.\\n\\u3000따라서 나는 자리에서 일어나 옷들을 챙겨 입고서 안뜰로 건너가 돌로 된 긴 통로 안으로 들어갔다. 안뜰 외곽으로 가 그곳에서 산책을 하며 마음의 안정을 얻을 요량이었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 나는 통로 안으로 들어가자마자 들고 있던 촛불을 꺼야했다. 왜냐하면 미스 해바샴이 낮은 목소리로 비명소리를 내며 유령 같은 방식으로 통로를 따라 걸어가고 있는 것이 보였기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000나는 멀리 떨어진 채 그녀를 뒤따라갔다. 그리고 그녀가 계단을 오르는  것을 보았다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴의 손에는 아무것도 안  덮인 촛불만이 들려 있었다. 아마도 그녀 자신의 방에 있던 ‘돌출 촛대’(=양초꽂이)들 중에서 촛불 하 나를 꺼내 온 것 같았다. 그 촛불에 비친 그녀의 모습은 이 세상사람  같지 않은 섬뜩한  모습이었다.\\n계단 바닥에 서 있던 나는 그녀가 문을 여는 모습을 보지 않았음에도 결혼식 축하연이 차려진 방에서 나는 흰곰팡이 냄새를 느꼈다.\\n\\u3000나는 그녀가 그 방안에서 걸어 다니는 것을 들었다. 그  뒤 나는 그녀가 그녀 자신의 방으로 건너가는 것을 들었다. 그 뒤 나는 그녀가 다시 결혼식 축하연이 차려진 방으로 건너오는 것을 들었다. 신음하는 듯 울리는 그녀의 비명 소리는 한시도 멈추지 않았다.\\n\\u3000잠시 후에, 나는 어둠 속에서 나가려고 그리고 되돌아가려고 시도해 보았다. 하지만 새벽의 여명이 길을 잘못 들어 내 손을 어디에 두어야 될지를 내게 알려주기 전까지는 나는 나가지도 그렇다고 되돌아가지도 못하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000이러한 모든 간격 동안, 내가 계단의 바닥 쪽으로 가려고 할 때마다, 나는 미스 해비샴의 발자국 소리를 들었으며 그녀가 든 촛불이 내 머리 위로 지나가는 것을 보았으며, 그리고 끊임없는 그녀의 낮은 비명 소리를 들었다.\\n\\u3000이튿날 에스텔라와 내가  새티스 하우스를  떠나기 전까진,  에스텔라와 미스 해비샴 사이에 의견차이의 재현은 더 이상 없었다. 그리고 그 비슷한 어떤 다른 사건도 더 이상은 재현되지 않았다. 다만 내 기억을 최대한 활용해보자면, 그와 비슷한 의견 차이는 네 번 더 있었을 뿐이 었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그 경우들을 다 포함하더라도 어떠한  경우에도  에스텔라를 향한 미스 해비샴의 태도가 변한 적은 없었다. 에스텔라를 향한 미스 해비샴의 이전의 특질들 사이에 근심 같은 무언가가 섞인 것 같다는 인상을 내가 받은 것만 제외하면 말이다.\\n\\u3000종이 위에 벤틀리 드러믈(22세, 주인공의 라이벌)의 이름을 기록으로 남기지 않고서, 내 인생의 이번 장을 넘기는 것은 불가능하다. 그렇지 않고서도 내가 다음 장으로 넘길 수 있었다면 나는 아주 기꺼이 넘겨  버렸을 것이다.\\n\\u3000핀치 새들(이른 말하면 안 되는 줄은 알지만-_-;; 일부 핀치 새를 박제한 모습이, 모자를 쓰고 상체가 발달한 신사의 모습을 많이 닮았음)이 의기투합하기 위해 모인 어느 때였다.\\n\\u3000어느 때와 다름없이 우리 중 어느 누구도 다른 어느 누구에 대해 동의하지 않음으로써 돈독한 느낌이 마구 발산되고 있을 때였다.(주인공과 런던 상류사회 젊은 신사들의 친선 모임인 ‘작은 숲의 핀치 새들’은   말 그대로 볼 짱 다본-_-;; 분위기 아시죠???? 술 마시고 죽자 식의, 웨이터에게 술 먹이고 계단에서 쓰러져 자게 하거나, 술 잘 마시다 자 기들끼리 싸우거나, 돈을 마두 펑펑 쓰는 모습을 서로에게 경쟁적으로 보이거나 하는 그냥 막짱  클럽입니다)\\n\\u3000모임의 주재하던(사회를 보던) 핀치 새(런던신사)가 ‘작은 숲’(클럽이름) 전체를 향해 질서유지 권 어쩌고 하며 정숙 할 것을 요구하더니 말했다.\\n\\u3000“자자 신사제군들, 정숙 좀 하게나. 드러믈(주인공의  라이벌) 씨는 아직 숙녀를 위해 건배를 들었던 적이 없소. 모임의 장엄한 헌법에 따라 저 짐승 같은 자식은 오늘 숙녀를 걸고 건배를 해야 하는 순번인  게야.”\\n\\u3000디캔터(보기 좋은 포도주병)들이 돌려지고 있는 동안, 나는 드러믈이 추잡한 방식으로 곁눈질해가며 나를 보는 것 같다는 생각이 들었다. 하지만 우리 사이에 그딴 우정이란 애초 존재하지 않았기 때문에 녀석이 나를 째려보는 것쯤이야 일을 법했다.\\n\\u3000그가 “에스텔라 양을 위해!” 건배할 것을 그  자리에 모인 사람들을  향해 요청했을 때, 내 분노와 놀라움을 정말이지 하늘을 찔렀다.\\n “어느 에스텔라를 말하는 거지?” 내가 말했다. \\n“넌 상관할 바 없어.” 드러믈이 대꾸했다.\\n\\u3000“어디 사는 에스텔라를 말한 거냐고?” 내가 말했다. “넌 어디 사는 에스텔라인지를 말할 의무가  있어.”\\n\\u3000녀석이 ‘작은 숲속의 핀치 새들’의 일원이었기 때문에 녀석은 그녀가 어디사는 누구인지 밝힐 의무가 있었다.\\n\\u3000“‘리치먼드(런던 내에서 가장 부유한 동네, 에스텔라가 머물고 있는 동네)’에 사는 에스텔라를 위해, 제군들.”라며 드러믈이 내 질문을 무시한 채 말했다. “절세의  미인이지.”\\n내가 허버트(21세, 주인공의 절친)에게 속삭였다.\\n\\u3000“절세미인에 대해 많이도 알겠다, 저 비열하고 항상 뚱해 있는 바보 같은 자식이!”\\n\\u3000“나도 그 숙녀 분을 알고 있어.”라며  허버트가 테이블 위를 가로지  르며 말했다. 그건 건배가 성공적으로 이루어진 후였다.\\n“네가?”  드러믈이 말했다.\\n“그리고 나도 알고 있지.” 내가 얼굴이 새 빨게져선 말했다. \\n“네 녀석이?”라며 드러믈이 말했다. “하느님 맙소사!”\\n\\u3000이것이(“하느님 맙소사!”) 이 둔중한(무거운) 녀석이 할 수 있는 재치 있는 응수의 전부였다. 유리잔이나 도자기류를 집어 던지는 행위를 제외하곤 말이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 나는 마치 그의 말 속에 신랄한 가시가 담겨 있기라도 한 것처럼 그 말에 격분해 즉시 자리를 박차고 일어나,\\n\\u3000“숲(‘클럽’을 의미함)에 등원해서, 숲에 등원해서(2번 반복하고 있음) 자신과 아무런 일면식도 없는 숙녀를 걸고 건배를 제안하는 행위는 명예 있는 ‘핀치 새’(‘클럽구성원’을 의미함)가 할 법하지 않은 뻔뻔스럽고 무례한 행동이라 생각하지 않을 수 없다.”라며 말했다.\\n\\u3000‘숲에 등원하다’란 말은 우리가 항시 즐겨사용 하던 멋있는 의회식 표현방식이었다.\\n\\u3000이 말에 드러믈 씨도 펄쩍 뛰며 “방금 그 말의 의미가 뭐야?”라며 내  해명을 요구했다.\\n\\u3000그것에 대하여 나는 “내게 결투장을 보내려면 어디로 보내야 할지 정도는 알 것으로 생각되는데.”라며 극단적으로 말했다.\\n\\u3000이후 피를 흘리지 않고서 이 문제를 넘어가는 것이 영국이라는 기독교 국가에서 가능한지를 놓고 핀치 새들(클럽멤버들)의 의견이 양분된 사건이었다.\\n\\u3000이것에 대한 토론이 너무 열기를 띄어가 정말이지 적어도 6명이나 되는 명예로운 핀치 새들이 토론 도중에 다른 6명 이상들에게 “나에게 결투장을 보내려면 어디로 보내야할지 정도는 자네도 알 것 같은데.”라며 말하기에 이르렀던  것이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 마침내는 다음과 같이 결정되었다. ‘작은 숲속의 핀치 새들’ (클럽이름)은 명예의 법정이었으니까. 핀치  새들의  결론은  다음과 같다.\\n\\u3000“드러믈 씨(22세, 주인공의 라이벌)가 그 숙녀 분에게서 자신이 그녀와 알고 지냄을 의미하는 아주 사소한 증서라도 가지고 온다면, 그럼 핍 씨(21세, 주인공이름)는 신사로서 그리고 핀치 새의 구성원으로서 ‘방금과 같이 흥분해 감정을 드러낸 것’에 대해 유감임을 표명해야 한다.”였다.\\n\\u3000기한은 우리의 명예가 지체로(지연으로) 식지 않도록 이튿날(다음날) 까지로 정했다.\\n\\u3000이튿날  드러믈은 에스텔라가 자필로 적은 공손하면서도 짧은 ‘시인서’ 한 장을 들고 나타났다. 그것은 〈 에스텔라는 드러믈 씨와 두서너번 함께 춤을 추는 영광을 입었었습니다. 〉 라는 내용이었다.\\n\\u3000이로써 나는 “‘내가 흥분에 휩싸여 감정을 드러냈던 것’을 유감으로 생각하며 그리고 전반적으로 ‘내가 결투장 운운한 것’이 지지될 수 없 음으로 그 말을 취소한다.”라고 말할 수밖엔 없었다.\\n“작은 숲속의 핀치 새들”의 멤버 전원이 무분별한 자기모순에 빠져\\n\\n\\n결국 최종적으로 상호간의 좋은 감정의 증진이 이토록 놀랄 만한 속도로 회복되었노라고 선포하는 동안에도 내내, 드러믈과 나는 서로 콧방귀를 뀌며 한 시간 동안이나 앉아 있었던 것이다.\\n\\u3000나는 이것을 가볍게 말하고 있다. 하지만 이것은 내게 가벼운 일이 아니었다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면, 에스텔라가 그런 경멸할 만한 비열하고 꼴사납고 널 뚱해 있는 멍청이에게 그런 식이라도 어떤 호의를 선사했다는 생각이 내게 어떠한 고통을 주었는지 도저히 표현할 길이 없을 정도이기 때문이다. 그것도 평균 이하보다 훨씬 더 아래에 있는 그런 녀석에게.\\n\\u3000이제까지, 나는 믿고 있다. 그녀가 저 사냥개에게 몸을 굽힌 거라는 생각을 내가 견딜 수 없는 것이 그녀를 향한 내 사랑 속에 담겨 있던 관대함과 사심 없음의 어떤 순수한 불꽃 탓이라고 해도 좋다고 나는 이제까지  믿고 있다.\\n\\u3000의심할 바도 없이, 그녀가 누구에게 호의를 베풀었던 나는 비참했을 것이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그 대상이 좀 더 가치 있었다면 그 대상이 좀 더 훌륭했더라면 내 번민의 종류와 강도는 달랐을 것이다.\\n\\u3000드러믈이 에스텔라를 열심히 따라다니기 시작했‘었’다는 사실과 그녀도 그가 그렇게 하는 것을 허락‘했다’는 사실을 아는 것은 그리 어렵지 않았고, 또 곧 나는 그 사실을 알게 되었다.\\n\\u3000꽤 오랫동안 드러믈은 매번 그녀를 쫓아 다녔고 그래서 그와 나는 매일  조우하게 되었다.\\n\\u3000드러믈은 우둔하고 끈질긴 방식으로 그녀를 붙잡고 있었고, 에스텔라 또한 그를 계속해서 붙잡고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 어떨 때는 그를 격려하다가도, 또 어떨 때는 좌절감을 안겨 주었다가, 또 어떨 때는 대번에 그를 기쁘게 해주었다가도, 또 어떨 때는 그를  공공연히 얕보며 경멸했다가, 또 어떨 때는 그를 아주 잘 알고 있는 것처럼 하다가, 또 어떨 때는 도대체 그가 누구인지도 기억나지 않는 것처럼 행동했다.(어장관리죵-_ㅜ.  슬퍼~어장관리)\\n\\u3000재거스 씨(변호사)가 일찍이 부른 이름이듯이 이 ‘거미’인간(드러믈) 은 숨어서 기다리는 데 익숙했다. 그런데 녀석은 거미 종족 특유의 참을성도  지니고 있었다.\\n\\u3000여기에 더해 녀석은 자신의 돈과 가문의 저명함에 대한 멍청이 같은 자신감도 가지고 있었다. 그 멍청한 자신감은, 녀석에게 부족한 집중력과 결연한 의지력 대부분을 대신해 녀석에게 유리함으로 작용하고 있 었다.\\n\\u3000그래서 이 거미인간은 집요하고 끈덕지게도 에스텔라를 지켜보고 주 시하면서, 자신보다 더 빛나는 수많은 벌레들을 감시하다 종종 아슬아슬한 순간에 똬리를 풀고 내려오곤 했다(에스텔라와 다른 남자와의 관계를  끊어버렸다는 의미임).\\n\\u3000리치먼드(런던 내에서 가장 부유한 동네, 에스텔라가 머물고 있는 동 네)에서 열렸던 어떤 공공 무도회 장소에서였다. 그 당시만 해도 대부 분의 장소들에서 공공 무도회가 열리곤 했다.\\n\\u3000에스텔라는 그 자리에 모은 어떤 다른 여인네들보다 탁월한 미모를 자랑하고 있었는데, 이 바보 같은 드러믈 자식이 그녀 주변에 아주 착 달라붙어 있고 그녀 또한 그 만큼이나 드러믈을 자신의 상대역으로서 묵인하는 태도를 보였기 때문에, 나는 녀석의 인간 됨됨이에 대해 에 스텔라에게 한 마디 정도는 들려주어야겠다고 결심하기에 이르렀다.\\n\\u3000나는 다음 순간을 포착했다. 그건 그녀가 브랜들리 부인(에스텔라가 사는 집 여주인입니다. 이름 아실 필요없습니다. 다시 안 나오는 엑스 트라입니다. 전혀 소설 진행과 상관이 없습니다.)이 그녀를 데리고 집 으로 데려다주기를 기다리고 있을 때였다. 그녀는  어떤  꽃들  사이에 따로 떨어져 앉아 마차를 탈 준비를 마친 상태였다.\\n\\u3000나는 그녀와 함께 있었다. 왜냐하면 그런 무도회 장소들로 갈 때나 집으로 귀가할 때는 내가 항상 그녀들과 동행했었기 때문이다.\\n“피곤하니, 에스텔라?”\\n“좀 그래, 핍(21세, 주인공이름).” “그렇겠지.”\\n\\u3000“오히려 내가 안 그렇다고 말해줄래. 잠들기 전에  ‘새티스 하우스’ (미스 해비샴의 저택이름)로 편지 한 통을 부칠 게 있거든.”\\n\\u3000“오늘 밤의 승리를 말씀드리려고?” 내가 말했다. “물론 아주 볼품없는  승리였겠지만, 에스텔라.”\\n“말에 뼈가 있다. 난 모르겠는데. 오늘 무도회에 그런 게 있었는지.” “에스텔라,”하고  내가  말했다.  “저쪽  구석에서  우리가  있는 여기로\\n건너다보고 있는 저딴 녀석 좀 봐봐.”\\n\\u3000“내가 왜 그를 봐야하니?” 에스텔라가 드러믈 대신에 나를 쳐다보며 대답했다. “네 표현을 빌리자면 저 구석에 그 사람이 있는 곳에 무엇이 있기에 내가 쳐다봐야한다는 거니?”\\n\\u3000“참으로, 내가 너에게 던지고 싶은 질문이야.” 내가 말했다. “왜냐하면 그가 오늘 밤 내내 네 주위를 배회하고 있기 때문이야.”\\n\\u3000“나방들과, 모든 종류의 못생긴 창조물들은,”이라며 에스텔라가 드러믈이 서 있는 쪽을 흘낏 쳐다보면서 말했다. “불을 밝히는 촛불 주변을 배회하기 마련이야. 촛불이 그것을 피할 순 없지 않겠니?”\\n\\u3000“그래,” 내가 대답했다. “하지만 그 유명한 에스텔라라면 그것을 피할 순 있지  않을까?”\\n\\u3000“글쎄!” 그녀가 잠깐 동안 웃더니 말했다.  “아마도.  그래,  네 좋을 대로 생각해.”\\n\\u3000“하지만, 에스텔라,  내 말에 귀 좀 기울여봐. 대체적으로 경멸을 받는 드러믈이란 남자를 에스텔라 네가 격려해야만 하는 이 상황이 나를 비참하게 한다고. 그가 얼마나 경멸받는지 너도 잘 알잖니.”\\n“글쎄?”라며  그녀가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“너는 잘 알고 있어. 그의 외모가 형편없듯이 그의 내면도 보기 흉하다는 사실을. 너도 알다시피 그는 불완전하고 성질이 나쁘고 항상 시무룩해 있는 그냥 그저 그런 우둔한(바보) 아일뿐이야.”\\n“그랬던가?”라며  그녀가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“넌 잘 알고 있어. 그가 돈과 아둔한 조상들의 웃기는 족보 외에는 전혀 내세울 것이 없다는 사실을. 그렇지, 너도 잘 아는 거지?”\\n\\u3000“그런가?”라며 그녀가 좀 전 그 대답을 반복했다. 그녀가 매번 “글쎄!” 혹은 “그런가?”라는 말을 할 때마다, 그녀는 자신의 사랑스런 두 눈을 점점 더 크게 뜨며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“글쎄!”나 “그런가?”라는 식의 외마디 대답 이상을  얻기가  어려운 것을 극복하기 위해 나는 그 외마디 대답을 그녀에게서 가져와 ‘글쎄!’란 말을 ‘그러면, 자아!’란 말로 강조해가며 다음과 같이 말했다.\\n“그러면, 자아! 그것이 나를 비참하게 만든 이유야.”\\n\\u3000자, 그녀가 나를…, 그러니까 나를…, 비참하게 만들려는 어떤 생각을 가지고서 드러믈(22세, 주인공의 라이벌)에게 호의를 베푸는 것이라 내가 말일 믿을 수 있었다면, 나는 그 문제에 관해 좀 더 좋은 심정이었을 것이다.(-_-;; 에스텔라는 정말로 드러믈을 좋아하고 있습니다. -_ㅜ 드러믈은 앞서 말했듯이 바보 같고 성격 더럽고 돈만 많고 가문은 좋지만 정말 인간이 덜 된 인물입니다.)\\n\\u3000하지만 그녀는 평소 그러듯이 나를 완전히 대화를 나누어 봐야 소용 없는 존재로 치부해버렸고, 그래서 나는 그녀가 정말 나를 비참하게 하려고 드러믈에게 친절한 것인지 아닌지를 알아챌 도리가 없었다.\\n\\u3000“핍(21세, 주인공의 이름)” 맞은 편 방을 흘낏 쳐다보더니 에스텔라가 말했다. “내 행동이 네게 미치는 결과에 대해서 바보 같이 굴지 마.  내 호의는 다른 사람에게도 미칠 수 있어, 또 그러는 것이 내 의도일 수 있어. 그것은 논의할 가치도 없어, 알겠니?”\\n\\u3000“아니, 가치가 있어, 논의할 가치가 있다고.”라며 내가 말했다. “왜냐하면 나는 사람들이 ‘그녀는 자신의 우아함과 매력들을 한낱 천박한 자에게 내던지고 있어. 그것도 세상에서 가장 저급하게 천박한 남자에게 말이야’라고 말하는 것을 견딜 수 없단 말이야.”\\n“난 견딜 수 있어.”라며 에스텔라가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“오! 그렇게 자존심 센 척 좀 하지 마, 에스텔라, 그렇게 고집 센 척 좀  하지 말라고.”\\n\\u3000“이젠 나보고 자존심 세고 고집 세다고 말하려는 거니!”라며 에스텔라가 쌍수(두 손)를 벌리며 말했다. “그것도 좀 전까지 어느 촌스런 남자에게 몸을 굽힌다고 나를  비난해놓고선!”\\n\\u3000“분명 넌  그렇게 행동하고 있잖아.” 내가 뭔가 허둥지둥 대며 말했다. “난 다 봤단 말이야. 네가 바로 오늘 밤 드러믈에게 보낸 표정들과 미소들을 내가 다 봤단 말이야. 넌 결코… 결코 내게는… 내게는 그런 표정과 미소들을 준 적이  없었는걸.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 너는 내가,” 갑자기 고개를 돌리더니, 화가 나지 않았다면 심각하고 상기된 눈초리로 나를 보며 그녀가  말했다.  “그럼  너는 내가 너를 속이고 덫에 빠뜨리길  원하니?”\\n\\u3000“그럼 지금 이 모든 상황이 네가 단지 그를 속여 덫에 빠뜨리려고  한 일이란 말이니, 그걸 지금 나보고 믿으라고, 에스텔라?”\\n\\u3000“그래, 그리고 다른 많은  사람들에게도…  그들  모두에게도. 하지만  넌 예외였어. 브랜들리 부인(에스텔라가 사는 집  여주인입니다. 이름 아실 필요 없음) 부인이 오신다. 이젠 그만 말할래.”\\n\\u3000이제 나는 내 심장을 그렇게도 가득 메웠던 그래서 내 심장을 그렇게도 자주 아프게 하고 또 아프게 했던 그 주제(사랑)에 대해서 한 장 (38장)을 배당했기 때문에, 이제부터 나는 아무런 방해를 받지 않고서 훨씬 더 오랫동안 나를 짓눌려왔었던 사건에 대해 이야기하려 한다.\\n\\u3000그 사건은, 내가 에스텔라라는 존재를 알기도 전이며, 그리고 에스텔라의 아이(에스텔라는 1살에 입양되었음) 같은 지능이 미스 해비샴(에스텔라의 수양어머니 = 길러준 어머니)의 황폐화된 손에 의해 첫 번째로 왜곡되고 일그러지던 시절부터 이미 준비되어오기 시작했었던 사건이었다.\\n\\u3000동양(터키가 오스만 제국일 때를 말함)의 이야기에, 정복의 기고만장 함에 취한 터키 황제의 호화로운 침대 위로 떨어질 예정인 무거운 석판은 보통 채석장에서 서서히 그 모양을 갖추어간다.\\n\\u3000석판을 적절한 장소에 붙들어 맬 밧줄이 지나갈 터널은 4킬로미터(km)나 되는 바위 속을 관통해 서서히 형성되며, 그럼 석판은 서서히  들어올려져, 일단 굴 천정에 끼워 맞추어지고, 밧줄로 그것을 결박한 다음, 4킬로미터(km)나 되는 터널을 통해 그 밧줄을 서서히 당겨 거대한 철고리에  잇는다.\\n\\u3000이 모든 것이 아주 많은 노동으로 완료되고, 그리고 때가 되면, 터키 황제(오스만 제국 황제)는 한밤중에 흥분하고, 그 거대한 철 고리에서

(콩닥콩닥~두근두 근~_~;;)\\n\\u3000그 소리에 내가 어찌나 깜짝  놀라며 어리석은  생각을 했는지,  그리고 내가 그 발자국 소리를 ‘내 죽은 친누나의 발자국소리’와 연관시켜 생각했었는지 하는 것은 중요한 것이 아니었다.\\n\\u3000그것은 곧 지나갔다. 나는 다시 귀를 기울였다. 비틀거리는 발자국 소리는 올라오고 있었다. 나는 그것을 들렸다.\\n\\u3000그때 계단 램프들이 강풍에 모두 꺼져버린 것이 기억난 나는 서재용 스탠드를 들고 계단 꼭대기로 나가보았다.\\n\\u3000아래에 있던 사람이 누구든 내 램프 불빛을 보자마자 멈춘 게 분명했다. 모든 게 너무도 조용해졌기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“아래에 누가 계세요, 안 계세요?” 내가  아래를  내려다보며  큰 소리로 말했다.\\n“네.”라며 깜깜한 아래쪽에서 어떤 목소리가 들려왔다. “몇 층을 찾으시죠?”\\n\\u3000“꼭대기 층(주인공의 방이 있는 층이 꼭대기 층임)이오, 핍 씨.” (핍은 주인공의 이름임,  23세)\\n“제 이름이 핍인데요. 무슨 문제라도 있으신 겁니까?”\\n\\u3000“아무 문제업소.”라며 그 목소리가 대꾸했다. 내게 그 말을 던진 남성이 계단을 올라오고  있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 계단 난간 너머로 램프 불빛을 비추며 서 있었다. 그가 서서히 램프 불빛 안에  들어왔다.\\n\\u3000내가 들고 있던 램프는 서재용 램프여서 일종의 갓을 씌운 전등이었다. 그래서 그 램프 불빛이 만드는 밝은 원(둥근 ‘원’)은 아주 협소했다.\\n\\u3000그 결과 아주 잠깐 동안만 그가 불빛 안으로 들어왔다 즉시 벗어났다.\\n\\u3000그가 불빛 안에 있는 그 한 순간, 나는 내게는 너무 낯선 어떤 얼굴을 보았다. 그 얼굴은 내 모습을 보고 감동받고 만족해하는 이해할 수 없는 분위기를 풍기며 나를 올려다보았기 때문이다.

간직하는 것이 내겐 하나의  보상이었단다.  내가  걸어가는 동안 그곳(오스트레일리아) 식민지 주민들이 탄 ‘서러브레드’(순수한 계통의 고급 말임. ‘경마용으로 쓰이는 말’을 상상바람)의 발뒤꿈치가 내 쪽으로 흙먼지를 올려 찰 때에, 내가 무어라고 말했겠니?\\n그래 나는 이렇게  대내였단다.\\n\\u3000‘이 자식들아 나는 너희들 보다 백배 천배는 더

대내였단다.\\n\\u3000‘그래, 이놈들아, 난 신사도 아니고 못 배워 처먹은 바보천치일 뿐이다. 하지만 네 놈들도 모르는 것이 있어. 내가 많이 배우고 때깔 나는 신사를 키우고 있다는 사실을. 너희 모두는 가축과 토지를 소유하고 있겠지, 그래 이 놈들아 너희들 중 어느 놈이 내가 기르는 것만큼이나 잘 자란 런던 신사를 알고 있다더냐?’라고.\\n이것이

그의 손이 피로 더럽혀져 있을 수도 있을 거란 생각을 했던 것 같다.\\n\\u3000“쉽지 않았단다, 핍(23세,  주인공의  이름).  내가  그  곳을 탈출하는 게 말이다.(유형지를 벗어나면 사형임)  또한  안전하지도  않았고 말이다. 하지만 난 굳건히 나와의 약속을 지켰단다. 그것이 어려우면 어려울수록 내 의지는 굳건했지. 난 확고했고 결심을 이미 마친 상태였으니까. 마침내 난 탈출할 수 있었단다. 얘야, 내가 그걸 해냈어!”\\n\\u3000나는 어떻게든 정신을 차리려고 애쓰고 있었다. 하지만 너무 놀라 정신을 차리려야 차릴 수가 없었다.\\n\\u3000그가 이야기하는 내내, 나는 그의 목소리보다는 창밖에서 들리는 바람과 비의 소음에 내 자신이 더 주의를 기울였던 것만 같았다.(창밖에선 지금 폭풍우가 동쪽에서 서쪽으로 휘몰아치며 엄청난 비바람을 뿌리고  있는 중임)\\n\\u3000심지어 이런 생각을 하는 지금조차도, 나는 그의 목소리를 창밖에서 들리는 소음과 구분할 수 없을 정도였다. 비록 창밖에서 들려오는 소음은 시끄러웠고, 그의 목소리는 조용했을 지라도.\\n\\u3000“날 어디에 재울 거냐?”라며 그가 머지않아 물었다. “나도 어딘가에 묵어야 하지 않겠니.  얘야.”\\n“주무시게요?”라며  내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그래. 좀 조용히 오랫동안 잠들고 싶구나.” 그가 대답했다. “파도에 이리저리 밀리고, 바닷물을 온통 뒤집어쓰며 왔단다, 수개월을 그렇게 말이다.”\\n\\u3000“저와 아주 친한 친구가,”라며 내가 소파에서 몸을 일으키며 말했다. “지금 부재중이에요. 그 친구 방을 쓰세요.”\\n“그가 내일 돌아오진 않겠지, 얘야?”\\n\\u3000“네.” 제대로 대답하려고 최선을 다했음에도 불구하고 내 입에서는 기계적인 대답이 나와 버렸다. “내일은 아니에요.”\\n\\u3000“왜냐하면, 명심해라, 얘야.” 그가 목소리를 낮추며 인상적인 자세로 자신의 가운데 손가락을 내 가슴 위에 대며 말했다. “경계할 필요가 있단다.”\\n“무슨 의미세요? 경계라니요?” “죽음이란 소리지!”\\n“무슨 죽음이요?”\\n\\u3000“나는 종신형(평생 감옥)을 선고받고 유형(섬에 보내져 가둠)에 처해  진 거란다. 그러니 귀국은 내게 있어 곧 죽음을 의미하지. 요즘엔 그런 식으로 귀국하는 유형자들이 지나치게 많아졌지. 아마 잡히는 날엔 나도  교수형이 틀림없단다.”\\n\\u3000“교수형에 처해진다.”는 말 외에는 다른 어떤 설명도 필요치 않았다. 이 가련한 사나이는 수년 동안 불쌍한 내게 자신의 금줄(금의 줄)과 은줄(은의 줄)을 채워주고는 단지 나를 만나기  위한  일념 하나로 그 모든 위험을 무릅쓰고서 수천 킬로미터 바다를 건너왔던 것이다. 그리\\n고 그 점에서 내가 그의 목숨을 수중에 두게 된 것이다!\\n\\u3000만약 내가 그를 혐오하지 않고 사랑했더라도, 만약 내가 가장 강한 반감을 지니고서 그에게서 몸을 움츠리지 않고 가장 강한 존경과 애정으로 그에게 매료되었더라도, 상황이 이보다 더 악화되었을 리 없었다. 반면에 상황이 이 보다 더 나아졌을 것이다. 왜냐하면 그를 보호해\\n준다는 사명이 좀 더 내 심장에 당연하고 상냥하게 호소했을 테니까. \\n\\u3000유형지를 탈출한 그를 위해 한, 내 첫 번째 조치는 창문 밖의 덧문을 닫는 것이었다. 그렇게 해서 어떠한 불빛도 밖으로 나가지 못하게 했다. 그러고는 창문들을 모두 닫고 단단히 잠갔다.\\n\\u3000내가 이러한 조치를 하는 동안, 그는 테이블 곁에 서서 럼주(사탕수수에 물을 타서 발효시켜 만든 술)와 비스킷을 먹고 있었다.\\n\\u3000따라서 내가 열중해 있는 그를 보았을 때, 나는 늪지대에서 그 죄수가 음식을 게걸스럽게(허겁지겁 욕심내며) 먹던 그 장면을 다시 볼 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000그건 마치 그가 이내 허리를 굽힐 것만 같은 그래서 자신의 다리에 채워진 족쇄를 줄(쇠를 자르는 대장간 도구)로 갈 것만 같은 그런 분 위기였다.\\n\\u3000나는 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)의 방으로 들어가, 허버트의 방과 건물내부계단(=층계=건물 내부에 1층에서  꼭대기  층까지  지그재그로 죽 이어져 있는 계단)으로 통하는 모든 통로를 차단했다. 그 결과 ‘허 버트의 방’은 내가 죄수와 대화를 나누었던 ‘방(서재 겸 방)’을 통해서    만들어갈 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000“지금 침대로 들어가실 건가요?”라고 내가 그에게 물었을 때, 그가 “그러마.”라고 대답했다. 그가 내게 “신사의 의복”을 몇 점 입게 달라고 했다. 아침에 입을 수 있게 말이다.\\n내가 옷을 몇 점 꺼내와 그가 쉽게 찾을 수 있는 곳에 놓아드렸다.   그때  그가  다시  내  두  손을  붙잡곤  “잘  자거라.”라고  얘기했을 때\\n내 피는 다시 얼어버렸다. \\n\\u3000나는 그 자리를 빠져나왔다. 내가 어떻게 그에게서 벗어났는지 생각나지도 않는다.\\n\\u3000우리가 함께 있었던 방(서재 겸 방)에 있던 벽난로의 불을 되살리고 나서 나는 그 옆에  앉았다.\\n\\u3000한 시간이나 또는 그 이상의 시간동안, 나는 너무나도 망연자실한 상태라 어떠한 생각도 할 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 나서야 비로소 나는 내가 얼마나 난파당했는지를 완전히 깨닫기 시작했으며, 그리고 내가 돛을 올려 출범한 배(런던신사가 되어 에스텔라와 결혼할 수 있을 거란 희망)가 어떻게 해서 산산조각이 나게 되었는지를 철저히 깨닫기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000나를 향한 ‘미스 해비샴’(주인공 고향에 사는 막대한 거부. 부자)의 의도들은 모두 한낱 꿈이었을 뿐임이 판명 났다.\\n\\u3000그리고 에스텔라는 내게 예정되어있지도 않았다. 나는 단지 ‘새티스 하우스’(미스 해비샴의 저택)에서 하나의 편의(편리한 것)로써 고생을 했던 것이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그저, 미스 해비샴이 자신의 탐욕스러운 친척들(미스 해비샴이 빨리 죽어 유산을 받길 원하느 친척들)을 상처내기 위한 가시(침)였을 뿐이었다. 나는 그저, 어떤 다른 실습도 가까이에 없을 때 연습용 상대로써 그래서 인공심장을 지닌 하나의 모델이었을 뿐이었다. 이러한 것들은 내가 그들을 처음 만났을 때 이미 느꼈던 쓰라림들이었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이 모든 쓰라림들 중에서도 가장 날카롭고 가장 깊은 고통을 주는 것은, 내가 조(58세, 선량하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물. 주인공의 친누나의 남편. 주인공의 친누나는 이미 죽었음)를 버린 이유가 이 죄 수(허버트 방에서 자고 있는 죄수) 때문이었다는 사실에 있었다.\\n\\u3000어떤 범죄를 저질러 유형지에 보내졌는지도 모르는 상태에서, 그리고 내가 지금 앉아서 생각에 잠겨 있는 이 집에서 붙잡혀 나갈지도 모를 이 죄수, 그래서 ‘런던의 중앙 형사 법원’(법원 이름이 ‘올드 베일 리’임)의 출입구에서 교수형에 처해질지도 모를 이 죄수를 위해 내가 선량한 조를 버렸다는 사실이 내게 가장 깊고 날카로운 고통을 주고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 이제 어떤 이유로든 조(58세, 선량하지만 많이 어리숙한 인물)에게로 돌아갈 수 없었다. 나는 이제 어떤 이유로든 비디(26세, 주인공의 전 여친)에게로 돌아갈 수도 없었다.\\n\\u3000간단히 말해, 그들이 내게 가치가 없다는 듯이 행동한 것에 대한 내 의식이 어떤 다른 설명으로도 납득이 될 수 없을 만큼 컸기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000지구상에 있는 그  어떤 지혜도, 그들이 내게  주었던 소박함과  신의를 내게 다시 줄 리는 없었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 내가 그들에게 저질렀었던 행동(주인공은 조와 비디를 부끄 러워했었음. 미천하다고)들만은 절대로, 절대로 무효로 만들 수도 그렇다고 원상태로 돌릴 수도 없었던 것이다.\\n\\u3000비바람이 몰아치는 중에도 나는  추적자들이  접근하는  소리를  들었다.\\n\\u3000두 번씩이나, 나는 바깥쪽 문에서 누군가가 노크하며 속삭이는 소리를 들었음을 맹세할 수 있을 정도였다.\\n\\u3000나를 덮쳐버린 이러한 두려움들에 휘감겨  버린 나머지, 나는 이 죄수의 등장을 사전에 알리던 설명하기 힘든 경고들이 무수히 있었음을 마음속으로 그려보고 더듬어보기  시작했다.\\n\\u3000즉, 지난 수주일(1주일 2주일 할 때의 ‘주일’)동안, 나는 거리들에서 이 죄수의 얼굴과 닮은 얼굴들을 지나쳤었던 것만 같았다. 그가 바다를 건너 와 내게로 점점 접근함에 따라 그러한 얼굴들을 접한 횟수가 월등히 증가했었던 것만  같았다.\\n\\u3000이 죄수의 사악한 영혼이 왠지 내 영혼에게 이러한 전달자들(얼굴이 비슷한 사람들)을 보냈을 것만 같이 생각되었다. 그리고 이제 이 폭풍우가 치는 밤에 그가 자신의 약속을 지키고 나타나 나와 함께 있게 된 것이다.\\n이러한 생각들과 함께 다음과 같은 생각들이 밀려왔다.\\n\\u3000그가 내 어린(주인공이 12살 때 / 주인공의 현재 나이는 23세) 눈으로 보았을 때에도 지독히  폭력적인  사람임에  틀림없어보였다는  사실과, ‘저 놈이 나를 죽이려 한다.’라며 또 다른 죄수(사기꾼 악당)가 소리 지르고 또 소리  지르던  모습과, 그리고 그(죄수)가 다른  죄수(사기꾼 악당)와 뒤엉켜 마치 야수처럼 도랑 아래에서 찢기고 때리며 싸우던 모습이 다시 기억났기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000이러한 기억을 회상하고 나자, 폭풍이 휘몰아치는  이  외로운  밤에 그와 단둘이서 이곳에 머물고 있는 것이 안전하지 않을 수도 있다는 아직은 덜 성숙된 두려움이 내가 쳐다보고 있던 벽난로의 불빛 속에서 되살아났다.\\n\\u3000이 공포심이 옆으로 퍼져 내가 있던 방을 가득 채우고서 결국 내가 촛불을 들고 방안으로 들어가 내 무시무시한 부담감(죄수)을 살펴보도록 만들었다.\\n\\u3000그는 머리 둘레를  자신의 손수건으로 감싸고 있었다. 자고 있을 때에도 그의 얼굴은 어떤 표정을 띠고 있었는데 잔득 흐리고 찌푸린 얼굴이었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그는 자고 있었다, 그것도 아주 조용히. 비록 그의 권총 한 자루가 베개 위에 놓여 있었을 지라도.\\n\\u3000그가 잠든 것을 확인 한 나는 열쇠를 문 바깥쪽 열쇠구멍으로 조용히 옮긴 후  잠갔다.\\n그런 후 나는 다시 벽난로 가로 와 앉았다.\\n\\u3000나는 점차(서서히) 의자에서 미끄러지듯 떨어져 바닥 위에서 잠이 들었다.\\n\\u3000나는 잠이 들어서도 내 가엾음에 대한 자각을 떨쳐버리지 못한 상태로 잠에서 깨어났다. 우리 집 동쪽 편에 있는 교회들에서 아침 5시를 울리는 종이 울리고  있었다.\\n\\u3000촛불은 모두 타 꺼진 상태였고, 벽난로의 불도 죽었으며, 비바람이 칠흑(광택이 나는 검은 색)같이 어둡고 무거운 캄캄함을 더 심화시키고 있었다.\\n\\n\\u3000“여기까지가 ‘핍(주인공이름)의 유산’ 두 번째 무대의 끝입니다.” (←  이 문장은 디킨스가 쓴 문장입니다. 영어원문에도 있는

일임을 따로 증명할 필요도 없었다.\\n\\u3000성공할  수도 없는  일이었으며, 그러한 시도는 필연적이다시피 의심을 불러일으킬 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000사실, 나는 이제는 어떤 ‘원수(주인공이 비싼 돈을 주고 부렸지만 거의 아무 일도 안했었던 심부름꾼 소년)’의 시중도 받고 있지 않았다. 하지만 가사도우미는 두었는데, 매사에 불평불만이 가득한 나이 많은 할머니가 자신의 조카라고 부르는 활기차고 옷차림이 추레한 어떤 여성의 도움을 받아가며 내 가사도우미 일을 도맡고 있었었다.\\n\\u3000당연히 이 두 여성에게서 방 하나를 비밀로 유지하는 것은 호기심과 과장을 유발할 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000그들 두 여성 모두 시력이 나빴는데, 나는 그것의 원인이 열쇠구멍을 잠깐씩 들여다보는 그들의 만성적인 행태에 의해 유발된 측면이 다분하다고 오랫동안 생각해오고  있었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 이 두 여성은 내가 원치 않을 때에도 항상 내 가까이에 있곤 했는데, 정말이지 그것은 도둑질을 제외하고 그들의 믿을 만한 유일한 자질이었다.\\n\\u3000이러한 사람들이 의혹을 품지 않도록 하기 위해 나는 아침에 “갑작스레 제 삼촌께서 시골에서 올라오시게 되었습니다.”라고 발표하기로 결심했다.\\n\\u3000촛불을 밝힐 수단을 찾기 위해 어둠 속에서 여전히 여기저기를 손으로 더듬는 동안 나는 이러한  행동방침(“죄수를  시골에서 올라온  자신의 삼촌이라고 말하려는 것”)들을  결정했다.\\n\\u3000결국 도구를 찾지 못한 나는 어쩔 수 없이 밖으로 나가 가까운 수위실로 가서 그곳에 있는 수위보고 그의 랜턴(=유리 덮개를 씌운 등)을 들고서 같이 가자고 말하기로  마음먹었다.\\n\\u3000이제 나는 껌껌한 건물내부계단(층계)을 따라 앞을 손으로 더듬으며 내려가고 있었다. 그때 나는 뭔가에 걸려 넘어질 뻔했다. 게다가 그 뭔가는 계단참(위층  계단과 아래층 계단 중간에 휴식을 취할 수 있는 공간) 한쪽 구석에서 웅크리고 있던 어떤 남성이었다.\\n\\u3000내가 그(‘그’를 꼭 기억하고 있어야 합니다. ‘그’의 이름은 중요하지 않습니다. 이름 몰라도 됩니다. 하지만 죄수의 등장과 함께 수상한 사람이 주위를 맴돌기 시작했다는 내용을 꼭 기억해두셔야 합니다. 나중에는 런던 사복경찰들까지도 주인공의 주위를 맴돕니다. 그건 나중에 가서 얘기하기로 하죠~,~액션 좋아~)에게 거기서 무엇을 하고 있는지를 물었을 때 그가 아무런 대답도 하지 않은 채 말없이 그러면서도 고묘히 내 손을 빠져나갔기 때문에, 나는 수위실로 뛰어가 수위에게 빨리 와 줄 것을 강력히 재촉했다. 그리고 오는 중에 수위에게  그 특이한 일에 대해  얘기해주었다.\\n\\u3000바람이 유례없이 강하게 불고 있었기 때문에, 우리는 랜턴(등불) 덮개를 열면서까지 건물내부계단(층계)에 있는 꺼진 램프들을 되 밝히려는 위험한 시도를 하진  않았다.\\n\\u3000우리는 건물내부계단(층계)의 바닥부터 꼭대기(주인공의 방이 있는 층)까지 조사했다. 하지만 사람의 흔적은 그 어디에서도 발견할 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000그때 나는 그 수상한 남성(계단중간에 웅크리고 앉아 있던 수상한 남성)이 내 방들 안으로 몰래 들어갔을 수도 있다는 생각을 문득 하게 되었다.\\n\\u3000그래서 수위가 들고 있는 랜턴으로 내 촛불을 밝히고서, 수위를 출입구에 계속 서 있게 한 후, 내 방들을 조심해서 살펴보기  시작했다.  내가 조사한 방들 중에는 내 끔찍한 손님이 누워 자고 있는 방도 포함 되었다.\\n\\u3000모든 방들이 조용했고, 확실히 그 침실들에는 어디에도 사람의 흔적은  확실히 없었다.\\n\\u3000일 년 365일의 밤들 중에서 하필 그날 밤에 허가받지 않은 거리 상인이 건물내부계단(층계)에 있었다는 것이 나를 불안하게 만들었다.\\n\\u3000그래서 수위에게 물어보았다. 그에게서 어떤 희망적인 설명을 이끌어낼 수 있지 않을까하며 은근히 기대하며, 내가 출입구에 서 있는 그에게 맥주 한 모금을 건네면서 물었다.\\n\\u3000“밖에서 식사하고 돌아오는 것 같은 어떤 신사를 정문에서 통과시켜준  적이 있으세요?”라고.\\n\\u3000“그렇습니다요.”라며 그가 말했다. “많이 다른 시간에 세 번 있었습죠. 모두 한  밤중이었데요.”\\n그가  계속 말했다.\\n\\u3000“한 사람은 파운튼 코트(분수 근처 집???? 어딘지 모름^^;; 주인공이 머물고

쓰지를 말든가? 내가 왜 썼을까 싶음.-_-;; 아무런 생  각이 없음)\\n\\u3000내 침실들이 있는 가옥(집)에는 나 말고도 한 사람이 더 살고 있었다. 그는 요 몇 주일동안 고향에 가 있었다. 그리고 그가 간밤에 돌아오지 않은 것이 확실했는데, 다름이 아니라 수위와 내가 건물내부계단 들을 올라가는 동안 그의 방 출입구가 단단히 잠겨 있는 것을 확인했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“밤에 날씨가 몹시 나빴지 않습니까요, 나리.”라며 그 수위가 내 잔을 돌려주며 말했다. “정문에 들어오는 사람이 굉장히 드물었는걸요. 지금 말씀드린 그 세 신사 분들을 제외하곤 말입죠. 어떤 낮선 사람이 어젯밤 11시 정도에 나리에 대해 물은 이후로는 다른 사람은 생각나지 않습니다요.”\\n“제 삼촌이에요.” 내가 작은 소리로 중얼거렸다. “예 삼촌요.” \\n“그럼 그를 보셨습니까요,  나리?”\\n“예.  아 예.”\\n“마찬가지로  그와  같이  왔던  사람도  말입니다?” \\n“그와 같이 왔던 사람이라고요!” 내가 놀라서 말했다.\\n\\u3000“저는 그(죄수)와 함께 온 사람일 거라고 생각했는뎁쇼.”라며 수위가 반응했다. “그(죄수)가 제게 물으려고 걸음을 멈추면 함께 온 그 사람도 멈추었고, 그(죄수)가 이쪽으로 쭉 가니까 함께 온 그 사람도 이쪽으로  쭉 가든걸요.”\\n“어떻게 생긴 사람이었는데요?” 수위는 뚜렷하게 기억하지  못했다.\\n“노동일을 하는 사람 같이 보이기도 하던데. 그거 참 기억이….” 그가  계속 말했다.\\n\\u3000“하지만 함께 온 그 사람이 갈색 작업복(검은 빛이 도는 갈색 작업복)을 입고 있었던 것은 확실히 기억납니다요. 작업복 위에 검정색(짙은) 외투를 그 사람이 입고 있었습죠.”\\n\\u3000내가 엄청 진진한데 반해,  그 수위는  그 일을 대수롭지 않게 여기고 있었다. 당연했다. 그가 나처럼 이 사건을 중요하게 생각해야할 이유가  없었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000나는 수위를 보내주었다. 그의 설명을 더 들어봐도 알 수 있는 게 없을 것 같아서였다. 하지만  하룻밤  사이에 동시에 발생한 이  두 사건은 내 마음을 엄청 불안하게 했다.\\n\\u3000반면에 그 일이 각각 개별적인 사안들이라면 위험이 없음을 입증하기는 쉬웠다.\\n\\u3000예를 들면 밖에서 식사를 가졌든 안에서 식사를 했든 누군가가 여기 이 수위실 정문을 통과하지 않은 채, 길을 잃고 우리  집 건물내부계단으로 들어왔을 수도 있었고 또 그러다 거기에서 곧 잠이 들었을 수도  있다.\\n\\u3000그리고 이름을 아직 모르겠는 내 방문자가 길 안내를 받기 위해 누군가를 데려왔을 수도 있는  일이었다.\\n\\u3000그럼에도 불구하고, 지난 몇 시간동안의 변화들이 내게 불신과 두려움을 준 것만큼이나 이 두 사안을 같이 놓고 생각해보면 사람으로 하여금 불신과 두려움을 유발시키는 험악한 측면이 있었다.\\n\\u3000벽난로의 불을 밝혔다. 아침 이맘때쯤이면 벽난로의 불은 잠깐 동안    만 확 타올랐다. 날것 그대로의 핼쑥하고 엷은 색깔의 불빛이었다.\\n그러다 벽난로 앞에서 나도 모르게 깜박 졸고 말았다.\\n\\u3000시계가 아침 6시를 울렸다. 하룻밤 내내 꾸벅꾸벅 졸은 것만 같이 제대로  못 잤다.\\n\\u3000햇빛이  비치려면 아직 한 시간 반은 족히 더 남아  있었다. 나는 다시 깜빡 잠이  들었다.\\n\\u3000어떨 때는 아무것도 아닌 장황한(긴) 대화들이  내  귀에  들리는 것 같아 불안 속에서 정신을 차리기도 하고, 또 어떨 때는 굴뚝 내부에서 바람이 만든 천둥 같은 소리를 듣기도 했다.\\n\\u3000결국 나는 깊은 잠에 들었다가 아침의 시작을 알리는 햇빛에 깜짝 놀라서  잠에서 깨어났다.\\n\\u3000지금껏 내내 나는 내 자신의 상황에 대해 고려해볼 여유가 전혀 없었었다. 또한 그건 지금도  마찬가지였다.\\n\\u3000나는 그것에 주의를 기울일 체력이 하나도 남아 있지 않았다.  나는  아주 실의에 빠져 낙담해 있는 상태였고 심리적으로도 괴로운 상태였다. 하지만 다수의 비논리적인, 뭐랄까 생각들에 휩싸여는 있었다.\\n\\u3000앞으로의 일들에 관해  어떤  계획을  세우는  문제라면,  나는  차라리 그 즉시 코끼리를 만들어낼 수도 있었을 것이다.\\n\\u3000내가 창문 덧문들을 열고 폭풍우가 휘몰아치는 아침을 내다보았다. 주위는 온통 탁한 회색 빛깔을 띠고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 방에서 저 방으로 걷다가, 벽난로 앞에서 몸을 떨며 의자에  앉아 있다가, 가사도우미 할머니와 할머니의 조카가 빨리 나타나주기를 기다리며 내가 지금 얼마나 비참한 상황 속에 빠져 있는지를 생각 해보았다.\\n\\u3000하지만 “왜?” 비참한지 알 수가 없었다. 또한 “내가 얼마동안 그런 상태였는지?”도 모르겠거니와, “내가 어떤 요일에 이렇게 곰곰이 생각에 잠겨 있는지?” 그리고 심지어는 “그런 생각을 하고 있는 내가 누구인지?”조차 알 수가  없었다.\\n\\u3000마침내, 가사도우미 할머니와 할머니의 조카가 도착했다. 할머니의 조카는 자신이 들고 있는 먼지투성이 빗자루와 쉽게 구분이 가지 않는 머리를  하고 있었다.\\n그녀들은 내 모습과 벽난로의 상태를 보고 놀란 표정이었다.\\n\\u3000내 삼촌(주인공이 죄수의 신분을 숨기기 위해 거짓말로 자신의 삼촌이라고 말함)이 어떻게 해서 간밤에 도착하게 되었는지 그리고 지금은 침실에서 잠자고 계시다는 얘기를 그녀들에게 전달했다. 그리고 그에 맞추어서 아침식사 준비들이 수정되어야함을  얘기해주었다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음, 그녀들이 가구 여기저기를 두드려대며 먼지를 만드는 동안, 나는 씻고 옷을 차려 입었다.\\n\\u3000그리하여 나는 일종의 꿈 또는 최면술에 걸린 사람 마냥, 다시 한번 벽난로 가에 자리 잡고 앉아서 그(죄수)가 아침 식사를 하기 위해 나오기만을 기다리고 있는 내 자신을 발견하게 되었다.\\n머지않아, 그의 방이 열리고 그가 나왔다.\\n\\u3000이런 말하기 민망하지만 햇빛에 의해 그의 모습이 더 흉측해졌다는 생각이 들었다.\\n\\u3000“심지어 전 이름도 모르는 걸요.” 그가 테이블 가에 있던 의자에 앉는 동안 내가 낮은 목소리로 말했다. “제가 어떻게 불러드리면 되죠? 전 아저씨가 제 삼촌이라고 사람들에게 말해놨어요.”\\n“딱 좋다, 얘야! 나를 삼촌이라 부르렴.”\\n\\u3000“그래도 이름은 가지고 계셔야죠. 배에 선승해 있으실 때는 어떤 이름을 사용했는데요?”\\n\\u3000“그래, 네 말이 맞구나. 내가 사용한 이름은 ‘프로비스’란다.” (‘프로비스’란 이름은 모르셔도 됩니다. 이후 소설 속에서 다른 이름을 사용 하거든요.)\\n“그럼 그 이름으로 하실 건가요?”\\n\\u3000“글쎄, 그럴까 한다, 얘야.  다른  것만큼이나  좋지  않니.  만약 네게 더 좋은 이름이 있다면야  몰라도.”\\n“실제 성함은 어떻게 되세요?” 내가 소곤소곤 그에게 물었다. “‘매그위치’란다.”  그가 동일한 말투로  이렇게  덧붙였다. “기독교  세례명으론 ‘아벨’이지.”(아시겠지만, 종교를 모르시는 분들도 많기  때문  에 → 아담과 이브의 둘째 아들이 아벨입니다. 형 카인이 동생 아벨을\\n○였습니다.)\\n“그동안 무슨 일을  하셨는데요?”\\n“벌레만도 못한 놈이었단다(불량배였단다).  얘야.”\\n\\u3000그가 아주 심각하게 대답했다. 그것이 마치 어떤 전문적인 직업을 나타내는 마냥 그 ‘벌레’라는 단어를 사용했다.\\n\\n\\u3000(잠깐 앞뒤 설명 : 죄수의 이름이 중요한 것이 아닙니다. 이름 외우기 힘드시면 몰라도 됩니다. 유형지를 탈출한 죄수란 것이 중요합니다. 걸리면 사형이란 게 중요하죠. 소설의 이야기 진행 상 ‘매그위치(가명: 프로비스)’의 나이는 57세 정도 됩니다.) \\n\\u3000“어젯밤 템플(템스 강 인근이자 런던 중앙)에  오셨을 때요….” 그가  온 것이 정말로 어젯밤인지 아니면 더 오래전인지를 순간 엄청 헷갈린 내가  멈칫하며 말했다.\\n“그래, 얘야?”\\n\\u3000“아저씨께서 정문으로 들어오셔서  수위에게 여기 이쪽 방향으로 오는 길을 물었을 때요, 일행이 있으셨던가요?”\\n“누구 말이냐? 전혀 없었단다, 얘야.” “하지만 거기에 누가 있지  않았나요?”\\n\\u3000“특별히 눈여겨 본 사람은 없었단다.” 그제야 그가 수상쩍어 여기며 말했다. “이곳의 길을 잘 모르니까 말이다. 하지만 한 사람이 있긴 있었던 것 같다. 나를 따라 누군가 들어오더구나.”\\n“아저씨가 런던에서도 알려져  있나요?”\\n\\u3000“아니길 바란다, 얘야!” 그가 자기 집게손가락으로 목을 자르는 시늉을 해보였다. 그것이 나를 덥고  메스껍게 만들었다.(주인공 마을 인근에 늪지대가 있는데, 늪지대 너머로 더 가면 버려진 교수대가 보임. 어릴 적에 주인공이 버려진 교수대를 보며 겁을 먹곤 쓸데없는 상상을 하곤 했음)\\n“그럼 이전엔 날리셨다는  얘긴가요?”\\n\\u3000“덧붙일 필요도 없다, 얘야. 난 대부분의  생을  지방에서  보냈으니까.”\\n“재판은 런던에서 받으신 거 아니었어요?”\\n“언제 말이냐?” 그가 매서운(날카로운) 눈으로 나를 보며 말했다. “마지막 재판이요.”\\n\\u3000그가 고개를 끄떡였다. “그렇게 재거스 씨(런던에서 가장 유명한 변호사)를 처음 알게 되었지. 그가 내 변론(변호사)을 맡았단다.”\\n\\u3000“그게 어떤 재판이었….” 내 말이 채 끝나기도 전에 그가 나이프(칼)를 집어 들더니 한 번 흔들어댔다.\\n그러더니 그가 이렇게  말했다.\\n“내 죄 값에 대한 지불은 노역(일하는 죄수)으로 모두 지불했다!” 그가  아침식사를 시작했다.\\n\\u3000그는 배가 고파 죽을 지경인  양 먹어댔다. 유쾌하지 못한 광경이었    다. 그의 행동들 하나하나가 모두 상스럽고 시끄럽고 탐욕스러웠다.\\n\\u3000늪지대에서(주인공이 12살 때 죄수에게 먹을 것을  건네주었을  때) 그가 먹는 모습을 본 이후로 그는 이빨 몇 개 떨어지고 없었다.\\n\\u3000그는 음식을 입으로 퍼 담고는 자신의 가장 강한 송곳니들(사람의 ‘어금니’가 아니라 동물의 ‘송곳니’를 말함)을 움직여서 음식에 압력을 가하기 위해 고개를 옆으로 털었을 때는 정말이지 그가 한 마리의 늙고 지독하게 굶주린 개  같았다.\\n\\u3000식욕을 느끼며 자리에 앉았더라도 그가 다 날려버렸을 것이다. 그리    고 처음 의자에 앉았던 그 자세 그대로 나는 앉아 있었을 것이다.\\n\\u3000대처할 수 없는 혐오감에 역겨움을 느낀 나는 그저 우울한 표정으로 식탁보만  바라보고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“난 대단한 식탐 가란다, 얘야.” 그가 자기 몫의 음식 접시들을 모조리 비운 다음에 예의랍시고 하는 말이었다. “항상 그랬지만 말이다. 내 체질이 좀 적당한 식탐 가였다면 그 생고생들도 좀 덜 겪었을 것이다. 마찬가지로 ○배를 좀 피워야했지. 지구 반대편에서 양치기로 처음 고 용되었을 때, 만약 내가 ○배를 몰랐었다면 아마 난 장기적이고 이유를 알 수 없는 우울 감에 젖은 양(가축)으로 변해버렸을 게다.”\\n\\u3000그렇게 말하더니 그는 자리에서 일어나 입고 있던 ‘피 코트’(선원용 코트,\\t이미지\\t링크

가루○배를 채워 넣은 그가 남은 가루○배들을 도로 가슴 께로 집어넣었다. 마치 그 호주머니가 서랍장이라도 되는 듯이 말이다. 그런 다음, 그는 집게로 벽난로에서 불이 아직 살아 있는 석탄하나 를 집어 자신의 파이프에 불을 붙이고는, 자신의 등이 벽난로 쪽으로\\n향하게 돌아서며 벽난로 앞에 깔린 깔개 위에 섰다.\\n\\u3000그가 곧 좋아하는 동작을 취했다. 물론 그것은 내 손을 쥐기 위해  자신의 두 손을 내미는 것이었다.\\n\\u3000“그러니까 이것이,” 그가 연신 내 손을 쥐고 위로 들어다가 아래로 내렸다가 하며 말했다. 그러면서도 연신 파이프를 뻐끔뻐끔 피워대고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“그러니까 이것이 내가 키운 신사란 말이지! 그래 영락없는 진짜 신사야! 널 이렇게 보고 있자니 내가 착해진 기분이구나, 핍(23세, 주인 공이름). 내가 바라는 것 이거뿐이란다. 단지 네 곁에 서서 너를 바라  보는  것이다, 얘야!”\\n\\u3000나는 최대한 빨리 내 손을 그의 손에서 풀었다. 나는 발견했다. 내가 서서히 내가 처한 상황을 충분히 고려하는 일에 착수하기 시작했음을 말이다.\\n\\u3000그의 쉰 목소리를 들으면서 그리고 그의 머리가 깊은 주름살이 진 대머리인 것을 올려다보며 앉아서 그리고 그의 머리 양 옆에서만 자라 있는 철(금속)과 같은 회색(색깔)의 머리카락들을 올려다보며 앉아서, 나는 내가 지금 어떤 쇠사슬에 매여 있는지 그리고 그 쇠사슬이 얼마나 단단한지를 나는 차츰 이해하기 시작했다.\\n\\n (아래는 죄수의 긴  대사입니다.)\\n\\u3000“나는 내 신사가  거리의

놓았다.\\n\\u3000“이 돈 다발이면 무엇이든지 살 수 있다, 얘야. 죄다 네거다. 내가 지니고 있는 모든 것은 내 것이 아니다. 죄다 네 것이다. 암. 전혀 걱정할 필요 없다. 내가 떠나온 곳에는 이보다 더 많은 재산이  있고 그  모두 이제 곧 네 것이 될 테니까. 나는 오직 내가 키운 신사가 기품있게 돈을 써대는 것을 보기 위해 고국으로 되돌아온

그리고 어디가 안전하실 것  같으세요?”\\n\\u3000“얘야.”라며 그가 반문했다. “가발로 변장하면 되잖니. 돈도 가져왔겠다. 머리에 바르는 가루(화장품?)도 있겠다, 안경이며 일꾼들이 입고 다니는 검은빛의 웃옷이며, 반바지 등등을 돈을 주고 구입하면 되지 않겠니. 이전에 영국으로 밀입국 했던 유형수(죄수)들도  모두 그렇게 해서 안전할 수 있었다. 그들도 했는데 나라고 경찰들을 따돌리지 말  라는 법이 어디에 있겠니. 기거하고 살 방도에 관해서라면 말이다. 그  것에 대해서라면, 얘야, 네 조언을 듣고 싶구나.”\\n\\u3000“지금은 그렇게 차분히 말씀하시지만,”라며 내가 말했다. “하지만 어 젯밤만 해도 아저씬 엄청 심각하게 받아들이시고 계셨잖아요. 맹세하건데  걸리면 죽음이라고요.”\\n\\u3000\\n\\u3000(아래의 글 모두 죄수의 긴 대사입니다. 죄수 이름은 ‘매그위치’입니다. 그의 가명은 ‘프로비스’입니다. 나이는 57세 근육이 잘 발달된 건장한 남성입니다.)\\n\\n(죄수의 긴 대사  시작)\\n\\n\\u3000“그래 그것이 죽음이라고 내가 맹세했지.” 그가 파이프를 다시 입에 물며 말했다. “아마 교수형이겠지. 이제는 멀리(오스트레일리아로 유 형)까지 갈 필요도 없이 시장거리에서 형이 집행될 거다. 일이 그리 될 거란 것을 충분히 이해해야한다는 말은 진심이란다. 그럼 그걸 충분히 이해했으니 그 다음엔 뭐가 어떻게 된다는 거냐? 난 이미 여기에 있고. 이제 돌아가는 것이 여기에 머무는 것만큼이나 나쁜데. 아니 더 험 악하지. 게다가, 핍(23세, 주인공이름), 난 네 옆에 몇 해고 있을 작정으로 건너 온 거란다. 내가 앞으로 무모하게 굴지에 대한 것을 묻는  거라면 말이다. 난 이제 조심성이 많은 새란다. 처음 날기 시작한 이후로 온갖 종류의 덫(함정)들을 뚫고 온 사람이지. 난 이제 허수아비 위에 걸터앉는 것도 두렵지 않단다. 만약 허수아비 안에 죽음이 숨어 있 다면, 있다면, 녀석을 끄집어내다오. 그럼 내가 녀석을 마주봐주마. 그 러고서야 난 그 녀석이 존재함을 믿겠다. 그 전엔 안 믿겠다. 자 이젠  내가 내 신사를 다시 한 번 바라볼 수 있게 해다오.”\\n\\n(죄수의 긴 대사 끝입니다) \\n\\n\\u3000(죄수의 실제 이름은 ‘매그위치’이지만 주인공은 그를 ‘프로비스’라고 부르기로 결심합니다. 하지만 매그위치란 이름도 자주 등장합니다. 그러니 헷갈릴 수 있음. 그냥 근육질의 죄수라고 생각해두는 게 가장 마음 편합니다. 그가 다혈질인 것도 잊어선 안 됩니다.)\\n\\n\\u3000다시 한 번, 그가 내 두 손을 잡더니 감탄해하는 소유자의 태도로 나를 살폈다. 그러는 동안에도 죽 그는 아주 만족한 듯이 담○를 피우고 있었다.\\n\\u3000허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)가 돌아왔을 때, 그(죄수)가 거주할 수  있는 어떤 조용한 숙소를 매우 가까운 곳에 확보하는 것이 낫겠다는 생각이 들었다. 허버트는 2~3일 후면 돌아올 예정이었다.\\n\\u3000어쩔 수 없는 불가피한 문제이겠지만, 이 비밀(죄수의 존재)을 허버트에게 털어놓아야함은 분명해보였다. 내가 허버트와 이 비밀을 나눔 으로써 얻게 될 큰 위로를 문제 밖에 두더라도 말이다.\\n\\u3000나는 그(죄수)를 ‘프로비스’(매그위치의 가명)라고  부르기로  결심했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)와 비밀을 나누는 문제는 프로비스 씨(57세, 죄수)에게는 결코 그렇게 간단한 문제가 아니었다.\\n\\u3000프로비스 씨는 자신이 허버트를 직접 보고서 허버트의 인상에서 호의적인 판단을 내릴 때까지는 이 일에 허버트를 참여시키는 것에 대한 자신의 동의여부를 보류한다고  말했다.\\n프로비스  씨가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그렇다고 해도, 얘야.”라며 그가 자신의 호주머니 속에서 손자국 기 름투성이고 한쪽이 지퍼로 채워진 작고 검은 성서를 뽑아들며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“성경에다 대고 맹세를 시켜야한다.” \\n\\u3000내 끔찍한 후원자가 이 작고 검은 성경책을 들고서 세계를 방랑하는 것이 오로지 비상시에 상대방에게 맹세를 시키기 위함이라 말한다면, 정말이지 나도 완전히 밝히지 못한 것을 말하는 일이 될 것이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 내가 말할  수 있는 것은 이것이다. 나는 그가 그 책을 어떤  다른 용도로 사용하는 것을 일찍이 결코 본 적이 없다.\\n\\u3000그 책 자체만 놓고 본다면 어떤 재판소에서 훔쳐진 것 같은 외관을 하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000아마도, 성경책의 앞서의 경력들에 대한 자신의 지식이, 자기 자신이 경험한 일(법정선고)과 슬기롭게 결합되어 그것이 그에게 일종의 법적인 매력과 부적으로써의 능력이 있다는 안도감을 주었을 것이다.\\n\\u3000그가 성경책을 처음 꺼내 보였을 때, “나는” 그가 오래전 ‘교회부속의 묘지’(주인공 마을에서 30분 정도 거리에 있는 늪지대를 들어가기 위해 지나야하는 교회부속의 묘지. 그곳에 주인공의 부모님 묘와 친누나와 아주 어릴 때 죽은 5명의 동생들 무덤이 있음)에서 나에게 어떻게 신의(믿음)를 지킬 것을 맹세시켰는지 와, 지난밤에 그가 나에게 자 신이 홀로 있을 때마다 매번 자신의 결심(자신은 힘들게 일하지만 런던 신사를 키워 남들에게 뽐내는 것)을 어떻게 다져왔는지를 묘사하던 일을 “회상했다(기억해냈다).”\\n\\u3000프로비스(죄수) 씨는 현재 선원용의 헐렁한 작업복을 입고 있었다. 그래서 그는 마치 옷 안에 내다 버려야할 앵무새 몇 마리와 시○(○뱃 잎을 썰지 아고 통째로 돌돌 만 ○배) 몇 개를 지니고 있는 것만 같았다.\\n그가 어떤 옷을 입어야 할지를, 나는 그와 상의했다.\\n\\u3000그는 변장에는 “반바지”(↔ “ ”라는 기호는 디킨스가 친 것입니다.) 가 미덕이라는 기이한(놀라운) 신념을 소중히 간직하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 자신에게 맞은 옷이랍시고, 자기 마음속에 있던 것을 스케치 했는데, 그건 그를 ‘대성당의 주임 사제’와 ‘치과의사’ 사이의 그 무엇 인가로  만드는 의상이었다.\\n\\u3000상당한 곤란함을 겪은 후에 나는 그에게 돈 많은 농장주의 옷차림 같은 의상을 착용하는 것이 좋겠다고 설득했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 우리는 그가 머리카락을 짧게 깎아야 한다는  것과, 그가 약간의 화장을 하기로  계획했다.\\n\\u3000마지막으로, 우리 집 가사도우미 할머니와 할머니의 여조카가 아직 프로비스 씨를 못 본 상태였다. 그래서 프로비스 씨가 옷을 모두 바꾸어 입을 때까지는 그녀들에게 안 보이기로 했다.\\n\\u3000이러한 예방책들(가발과 화장과 옷 바꿔 입기)을 정하는 것은 간단한 문제일 수도 있다. 하지만 그의 등장으로 인한 일련의 사건들로 내 머리가 멍해진 상태에서, 그러니까 내 머리가 산만해진 것이 아니라 멍해진 상태에서, 예방책들을 강구하는 것은 시간이 많이 지체되는 일 이었다.\\n\\u3000그날 오후 2시 또는 3시가 되어서야 나는 계획한 것들을 성공시키기 위해 외출할 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000물론 프로비스 씨에게는 침실에 잠자코 계시라고 했다. 그리고 어떤 사정이 있어도 문을 열어주어서는 안 된다고 신신당부했다.\\n\\u3000에식스 거리(런던)에 꽤 괜찮은 하숙집 하나가 나와 있다는 사실을  알고 있었기 때문에 나는 우선 그 하숙집으로 갔다.\\n\\u3000그 하숙집 뒤편이 템플로 향해있었다. (※ 참고, 템플 동서남북 지리 잠깐 설명 :   런던 중앙이자 템스 강과 붙어있는 지역 / 남쪽이 템스     강. 북쪽이 템플임. 그 템플 안에 주인공의 집이 있음. 템플에 있는 주 인공의 집에서나 지금 계약하려는 하숙집을 나와 템스 강에 작은 배를 띄우고 왼쪽으로 계속 가면 외국으로 갈 수 있는 큰 배들이 들어오고 나가는 항구가 나옴 / 그러니까 요지는 배경이 지금의 런던 중앙이자 ‘템스 강의 북쪽’이라는 것)\\n\\u3000내 방(템플에 있는 주인공의 속소) 창문에서 큰 소리로 부르면 거의 들릴 그런 거리에 이 하숙집은 위치해 있었다.\\n\\u3000정말 다행이었다. 자칭 타칭 내 삼촌 ‘프로비스 씨’(죄수 / 실명은 ‘매그위치’ 가명이 ‘프로비스’임)를 위해 2층을 확보할 수 있었기 때문 이다.\\n그런 다음 나는 이 가게 저 가게로 돌아다니며 그의 겉모습을 바꾸어줄  물품들을 구입했다.\\n\\u3000이 일을 처리한 다음, 나는 방향을 돌려 내 볼일(재거스 변호사를 만나 따지는 것)을 보러 ‘리틀 브리튼’(재거스 변호사 사무실이 있는 거리이름. 런던 북서쪽에 있는 거리이름임)으로 향했다.\\n\\u3000재거스 씨(런던 유명 변호사)가 아직 자기 자리에 있었다. 하지만 내가 들어가는 것을 보곤 즉시 자리에서 일어나 벽난로 앞에 자리를 잡고 섰다.\\n\\u3000“지금부터는, 핍(23세, 주인공이름).”라며 재거스 씨(50세, 런던변호 사)가  말했다. “조심하게나.”\\n\\u3000“그러고 있습니다, 선생님, 앞으로도 그럴 거고요.” 내가 받아쳤다. 왜냐하면, 내가 무슨 말을 할지에 대해 충분히 생각해보며 왔었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“자기 자신을 위험에 빠뜨리지 말게.”라며 재거스 씨가 말했다. “그리고 누군가를 위험에 빠뜨리지도 말게. 알겠지…  누군가를,  말이네. 어떤 말도 내게 더 하지 말게. 난 아무 얘기도 더 듣고 싶지 않으니까. 그리고 호기심이 일지도  않네.”\\n\\u3000물론 나는 이해했다. 프로비스가 귀국했음으로 재거스 씨도 알고 있음을 말이다.\\n\\u3000“단지 제가 바라는 건 말입니다, 재거스 씨.”라며 내가 말했다. “제가 들었었던 내용이 사실인지를 확인받고 싶다는 것입니다. 물론 그 얘기가 사실이 아닐 가능성은 전혀 없지만, 하지만 적어도 그것이 진 실인지 여부는 제가 확인해도  되잖아요.”\\n\\u3000재거스 씨가 동의의 표시로 고개를 끄떡여보였다. “하지만 자네는 ‘들었다’라고 말한 건가 아님 ‘확인했다’라고 말한 건가?”라며 그가 내게 물었다. 물론 예의 그 트레이드마크인 고개를 한 쪽으로 기울이며  내게 물었다. 하지만 나를 쳐다보고 있진 않았다. 내 말에 귀를 기울이면서도 시선은 바닥을 내려다보고  있었다.\\n그가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“‘들었다’라는 말은 언어적 의사소통을 의미할 수도 있네. 자넨 ‘뉴 사우스 웨일스’(오스트레일리아의 남동부 주. 주의 중심도시가 ‘시드니’임 / 헷갈리시죠. 이 소설의 무대는 오직 런던 중심부이기 때문에 지금 나오거나 앞으로 나올 여타 지역들의 이름은 전혀 신경 안쓰셔도 됩니다. 오스트레일리아니 시드니니 이런 것과 이 소설과는 전혀 상관이 없음 몰라도 됨)에 있는 남성과는 언어적 의사소통을 가질 수  없다  네, 알겠지.”\\n“그럼 이렇게 말씀드리겠습니다. ‘확인했습니다.’ 재거스 씨.” “좋네.”\\n\\u3000“저는 ‘아벨 매그위치’(죄수의 실제 이름이 ‘매그위치’입니다. ‘아벨’의 매그위치의 세례명입니다.)라는 어떤 사람으로부터 ‘그가 오랫동안 저를 후원해왔었던 익명의 후원자라는 사실을 통지(확인)받았습니다.”\\n\\u3000“그가,”라며 재거스 씨가 말했다. “뉴 사우스 웨일스에 있다는 그 남성이네.”\\n“단지 그(‘그 사람’ 할 때의 ‘그’) 뿐입니까?”라며 내가 말했다.\\n“단지 그(‘그 사람’ 할 때의 ‘그’) 뿐이네.”라며 재거스 씨가 말했따.   “전 그렇게 철이 없지 않습니다, 선생님. 제 오해들과 잘못된 판단들\\n에 대해 선생님께서도 전혀 책임이 없다고 말할 정도로 전 그렇게 철이 없는 게 아닙니다. 단지 전 항상 제 후원자가 미스 해비샴(‘주인공 마을’의 ‘인근 읍내 외곽’에 사는 갑부)일 거라고 생각해왔습니다.”\\n\\u3000“핍(23세, 주인공이름), 자네가 말하듯이,” 재거스 씨(변호사)가 내게 쌀쌀맞은 시선을 던지며, 자신의 집게손가락을 한 입 베어 물며 말했다. “나는 전혀 거기에 대해서 책임이 없네.”\\n\\u3000“그럼에도 불구하고 그렇게 보이셨잖아요, 선생님이요.”라며 내가  한 껏 풀이 죽은 마음으로  항변했다.\\n\\u3000“털끝만한 증거도 없었네, 핍(주인공이름).” 재거스 씨가 고개를 가 로저으며 자기 셔츠의 주름을 접으며 말했다. “사물의 겉모습만보고서 받아들이지 말게나. 실제 있는 증거에 주의를 기울이게. 그보다 더 좋은  원칙은 없다네.”\\n\\u3000“더 드릴 말씀이 없습니다.” 잠깐 동안 침묵을 유지한 후 내가 한숨을 내쉬면서 말했다. “제가 받은 제보(정보)를 확인했으니 이제 끝입니 다.”\\n\\u3000“그리고 ‘뉴 사우스 웨일스’(오스트레일리아의 남동부 주. 주의 중심 도시가 ‘시드니’임)에 있는 ‘매그위치’(죄수의 실제 이름)가 마침내 자기 자신을 드러냈으니,”라며 재거스 씨가 말했다. “자네도 이해해줄 거네, 핍(주인공이름), 내가 자네와 연락하는 내내 얼마나 엄격하게 사실에 대한 엄밀한 선을 충실히 지켜왔었는지를 말일세. 사실에 대한 엄밀한 선에서 한 치의 일탈도 나는 절대 없었네. 자네도 그 점을 잘 알고 있지?”\\n“잘 알죠, 선생님.” \\n\\n(재거스 변호사의 긴 대사 시작)\\n\\n\\u3000(대사가 길어서 읽기 쉽도록 임의로 단락을 나누었습니다. 하지만 모두 한 사람의 긴 대사입니다.)\\n\\n\\u3000“나는 분명 매그위치(죄수의 실제이름)에게 전했다. 물론 ‘뉴 사우스 웨일스’(오스트레일리아의 남동부 주. 주의 중심도시가 ‘시드니’임)에 있는  매그위치 말일세.\\n\\u3000‘뉴 사우스 웨일스’에 있는 그가 처음 편지를 보냈을 때, 나는 분명 그에게  주의를 주었다네.\\n\\u3000내가 사실에 대한 엄격한 경계선에서 한 번이라도 벗어나리라고 그가 기대해선 안 된다고  말이네.\\n\\u3000나는 또한 그에게 다른 주의도 주었네. 그가 여기 고국 땅에 있는  자네를 만나고 싶다는 어떤 막연한 생각을 애매하게나마 자신의 편지에서 암시하고 있는 듯이 보였기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000내가 그에게 이렇게 주의를 주었네. 그 문제(주인공을 고국에서 만나는 문제)에 관해서라면 내게 더 이상 아무 말도 말라고 말이네.\\n\\u3000그리고 그가 형 집행을 면제받을 가능성은 결코 없을 것이며, 그가 종신유형(평생 섬에 보내 가둬버림)을 선고 받고 추방된 것이라는 사실과, 고국 땅에 그가 발을 디디는 순간 그는 중범죄를 행하는 것이 되며 이는 곧 그가 유형보다 더 한 법정 최고형을 선고받을 수도 있음을 나는 분명 그에게 일러주었네.”라며 재거스 씨가 나를 지그시 바라보면서 말했다.\\n\\u3000“나는 그러한 내용의 편지를 ‘뉴 사우스 웨일스’(오스트레일리아의 시드니 근처)로 보냈네. 의심할 바 없이 그는 분명 그 편지의 내용대로 따랐을 것이네.”\\n\\n(재거스 변호사의 긴 대사 끝) \\n\\n“그렇겠죠, 의심할 바 없이….”라며  내가  말꼬리를  흐리며  말했다. “나는 웨믹(변호사 사무실의 서기)에게서 보고를 받았네.” 재거스 씨\\n가 여전히 나를 지그시 바라보며 이야기를 이어갔다. “웨믹은 이러한 내용의 편지를 받았다고 하더군. 날짜 란에 포츠머스(영국남부의 항구 도시이름)라고 적힌 어느 편지는 어느 식민지 주민에게서 온 편지인데 그의 이름이 ‘푸’르비스  뭐라더라….”\\n“아마 ‘프’로비스 일겁니다.” 내가 넌지시 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그렇군, ‘프’로비스였네. 고맙네,  핍(23세,  주인공이름).  아마 그가 그 프로비스일테지?

내가 구할 수 있는 직업은, 즉, 군인이 되는 길 뿐이야. 벌써 지원했을 수도 있었어, 허버트(친 구이름). 하지만 네 우정과 애정이 담긴 조언을 먼저 들어보고 싶었을 뿐이야.” (당시 빨간 군복을 입은 영국육군병사들의 전투력은 세계최고를 자랑하고 있었는데, 전투력은 최강인 대신 어찌나 하는 짓들이 하류였는지 영국 지휘관들조차도 자신들의 병사를 “쓰레기들을 모아놓았 다”라고 했을 정도임. 어느 책에서 봤음-_-;;)\\n\\u3000물론 나는 이 부분에서 울음을 터뜨리고 말았다. 물론 허버트는 내  손을 따뜻하게 감싸줌으로써 내가 울고 있다는 사실을 모르는 체 해주 었다.\\n\\u3000“어쨌든, 헨델(주인공의 애칭).”라며 허버트가 곧 입을 열었다. “군인이 되는 건 지금 이 상황에선 아닌 것 같아. 만약 네가 그의 후원과 호의들을 포기할 것을 선언할 생각이라면, 내 생간엔 네가, 네가 벌써 받은 금액들에 대해 미래의 어느 시점에라도 되갚아줄 줄 수 있다는 약간 미약한 희망을 지고서 포기 선언을 하는 게 나을 것 같거든. 하지만 군인이 된다면 그의 돈들을 되갚을 수 없잖니. 힘들어지지. 게다가, 군인이 되겠다니 터무니없는 발상 이야! 차라리 ‘클래리커(사람이름 / 주인공이 몰래 돈을 투자해 허버트   를 고용하게 한 회사이름이자 대표이름) 회사’에 들어오는 것이 훨씬 더 잘하는 일이 될 거야. 물론 현 상황에서는 조그마한 회사지만. 그래도 알잖니, 내가 클래리커 씨(←독자가 이름 알 필요 없음)와 동업자 관계로까지 발전하고 있는  걸.”\\n\\u3000아 가엾은 녀석(허버트)! 녀석은 클래리커 회사의 투자금(주인공이 클래리커 씨에게 1억 2천 5백만 원을 계약금 조로 주었고, 나머지 투 자금액에 대해서는 주인공이 유산을 물려받으면 내기로 한 금액의 출처를 말함)이 누구의 돈인지에 대해서는 일말의 의심도 품지 못하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“하지만 다른 문제가 있어.”라며 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)가 말했다. “이건 무지하고 결의에 찬 한 남성의 이야기야. 그것도 오랫동안 한 가지 생각에 고정되어 왔던 남성 말이야. 그(그것)보다 더한 문제는, 내가 봤을 때 그가 될 대로 되라는 식의 절망적이고 사나운 성격의 사나이 같이 보였다는 거야. 물론 내가 잘못 짚었을 수도 있지만.”\\n\\u3000“내 생각도 마찬가지야.” 내가 대꾸했다. “그것을 증명할 얘기를 해줄까. 내가 보아 온 것을 말이야.”\\n\\u3000프로비스(57세, 죄수)가 자리에 있을 때는 하지 못했던 나머지 얘기들, 즉  내가 어릴 적에 프로비스가 또 다른 죄수와 사납게 싸우던 얘기를  허버트에게 들려주었다.\\n\\u3000“그럼, 봐봐.”라며 허버트(친구)가 말했다. “이렇게 한 번 생각해보자고! 그는 목숨을 걸고 영국으로 돌아온 거야. 왜냐하면 자신의 고정된 한 가지 생각을 현실화하기 위함이지. 그의 모든 노력과 기다림이  이제 현실화되는 순간, 너는 그의 발밑에 있던 발판을 빼버리는 거고.  그럼 그의 꿈은 사라질 테고, 그럼 그의 수입들도 더 이상 자신에게 가치 없는 것이 될 테지. 그럼  그가 그렇게 낙심한 상태에서  그가 과연 어떤 선택을 할 수 있을까?”\\n\\u3000“나도 그건 생각해봤어, 허버트(친구이름), 그렇게 해보려고도 했어, 그가 처음 도착한 그 끔찍한 밤  이후로 쭉 말이야. 하지만 그럴 경우  그가 모든 걸 놓아버리고 스스로를 체포당하게 할 거란 생각들 외에는 뚜렷하게 떠오르는 건  없었어.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 너는 이렇게 생각해도 좋아.”라며 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절 친)가 말했다. “그가 그것을 행할 위험성이 커다는 사실을 말이야. 그것이 너를 쥐고 있는 그의 힘이야. 그가 영국 땅에 머물러 있는 한은 말이야. 네가 만약 그를 저버리고 떠난다면 스스로를 체포당하게 하는 것이 그의 무모한 행동방침이 될 거야.”\\n\\u3000나는 이런 생각의 공포에 꽉 붙들려 있었다. 그것은 처음부터 나를 짓눌러 왔었던 공포였다. 그 생각이 현실로 작동한다면 나는 내 자신을 얼마간은 살인자로 여길 것이다.\\n\\u3000나는 의자에서 휴식을 취할 수가 없어 일어나 앞으로 뒤로 걷기 시작했다.\\n그 동안에도 나는 허버트에게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“심지어 만약 프로비스(57세, 죄수)가 자기 의사(생각)에 반해 알려지게 되고 체포당하게 되더라도, 나는 그의 체포의 원인 제공자로써 비참한 상태로 접어들 거야. 내가 비록 죄가 없다하더라도 말이야. 그건 맞는 소리야. 그를 잡히지 않게 도와주고 내 곁에 머물 수 있게 하는 것이 나를 아주 비참하게 만들지라도, 그리고 내가 항상 이 꼴이 되느니 차라리 내 전 생애를 대장간에서 보내기를 훨씬 더 간절히 바 래왔을지라도!”\\n\\u3000하지만 그 질문을 피할 길은 어디에도 없었다. 즉 “그럼 이제 어떻게 해야 한단  말인가?”\\n\\u3000“제일 중요하고 우선순위를 두어야 할 것은,”라며 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)가 말했다. “일단 그(프로비스)를 영국 땅에서 벗어나게 하는 거야. 너도 그와 함께 가야하고, 그래야지 그를 설득할 수 있을 테니까.”\\n\\u3000“하지만 내가 가려는 곳으로 그를 데려간다 해도, 도대체 내가 어떻게 그의 귀국을 막을 수 있겠니?”\\n\\u3000“내가 인정하는 헨델(주인공의 애칭)아, 그에게 내 생각을 알렸을 때 그리고 그가 무모하게도 체포당하려고 할 때 바로 다음 거리(길)에 ‘뉴 게이트’(런던 내에 있었던 유명한 옛 감옥, 1902년에 폐쇄되었음) 교도소가 있는 이곳이 어딘가 다른 곳보다 훨씬 더 큰 위험하다는 것이 명 백하지 않니? 이제, 다른 죄수나 또는 그의 삶 속에 있는 그밖에 다른 무언가로부터 그를 국외로 도피시킬 구실을 찾을  수  있으면  좋겠는 데.”\\n\\u3000“거 봐! 또!”라며 내가 허버트(친구) 앞에 멈춰 서고는 마치 내 두 손바닥에 절망적인 사실이 들어있기라도 하다는 듯이 내 두 손바닥을 내밀며 말했다. “나는 그의 삶에 대해 전혀 몰라. 밤에 여기 앉아서 가 까이서 그를 보는 것이 나를 거의 제정신이 아니게 만들었거든. 이토록 내 행운과 불행과 밀접한 관련이 있음에도 불구하고 내 어린 시절에 이틀(2일)동안 나를 겁먹게 한 성질 나쁘고 불운했던 사람이었다는 것을 제외하면 나는 그의 삶에 대해 전혀 몰라!”\\n\\u3000허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)가 일어섰다. 그가 자신의 팔로 내 팔을 팔짱꼈다.\\n\\u3000우리는 카펫을 살피며 팔짱 낀 자세로 함께 천천히 앞뒤로 움직였다.\\n\\u3000“헨델(주인공의 애칭 / 별명),” 허버트가 걸음을 멈추면서 말했다. “너는 그로부터 추가적인 금전적 도움을 받지 않을 확신이 서 있니, 그러니?”\\n\\u3000“완전히 확신해. 물론 너라도 그러지 않겠니. 만약 네가 내 입장에 놓였더라면 말이야?”\\n“그리고 넌 그와의 관계를 끊어야만 한다는 확신이 서 있니?” “허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친), 어째 질문이 이상하다?”\\n\\u3000“하지만 넌 너 때문에 그가 목숨을 건 것 때문에 네가 그 친절에 도 의적인 책임이 있다고 그래서 만약 가능하다면 그가 목숨을 버리지 않 도록 네가 그를 구해야한다고 생각하고 있어. 그러니까 네 자신을 구  하기 위해서라도 네가 손가락 하나를 까딱이기 전에 넌 그가 영국 땅을 떠날 수 있게 해주어야 하는 거야. 그 일이 성공한 후에야, 하늘에 맹세코 넌 탈출에 성공하게 되는 거지, 그리고 우린 함께 결말까지 지 켜보게 될 거고, 안 그러니 친구.”\\n\\u3000그것에 대해 악수를 나누고 다시 왔다 갔다 했더니 나름 위안이 되  었다.\\n\\u3000“자, 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친).”라며 내가 말했다. “이제부턴 그의 살아온 내력을 어떻게 조금이라도 알 수 있느냐하는 문제야.”\\n\\u3000하지만  내가 알기론 방법은 하나뿐이었다. 즉 내가  딱 잘라서  그에   게 직접 물어보는 방법 말이다.\\n\\u3000“그래, 내일 아침 식사 자리에 앉았을 때,”라며 허버트가 말했다. “그에게 한 번  물어봐봐.”\\n\\u3000왜냐하면\\t프로비스(57세,\\t죄수)가\\t허버트와\\t작별인사를\\t하자마자 “자네들과 함께 아침을 들러 오겠네.”라고 말했었기 때문이다.\\n이 프로젝트를 구체화시킨 후 우린 잠자리에 들었다.\\n나는 프로비스(57세, 죄수)와 관련된 가장 사나운 꿈을 꾸었다. 다음날 나는 기력을 회복하지 못한 체 잠에서 깨어나고 말았다.\\n\\u3000나는 또한 밤중엔 잊고 있었었던 두려움, 즉 프로비스가 귀환한 추 방자인 게 적발되지나 않았을까하는 두려움을 다시 느끼며 잠에서 깼다.\\n깨어나서도 나는 그 두려움을 절대 잊을 수가 없었다. \\n약속된 시각에 그가  돌아왔다.\\n\\u3000그는 자신의 잭나이프(접을 수 있는 주머니칼)를 식탁 위에 꺼내놓더니 음식이 차려진 자리에  앉았다.\\n\\u3000그는 계획들로 가득했다.  자신의  신사(주인공  자기  자신)를 어엿한 한 명의 신사처럼 세상에 드러낼 갖가지 강력한 계획들 말이다.\\n\\u3000그가 내 소유라며 두고 갔었던 그 핸드백 속에 든 돈다발을 어서 쓰라고  내게 충고했다.\\n\\u3000그는 ‘내 숙소와 자신의 하숙집’도 그냥 임시 거주지로써 생각하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그가 곧  내게 “런던 상류층 부자들이 사는 최신 유행의 집”을 알아볼 것을 조언했다. ‘하이드 공원(런던의 공원)’ 근처로 알아볼 것도 주 문했다. 물론 그 집에는 자신이 지낼 수 있는 잠자리도 하나 있어야  한다는 말도 잊지  않았다.\\n\\u3000그가 자기 몫의 아침식사를 해치우고 자신의 바지 위에다 잭나이프 (주머니칼)를 쓱쓱 닦고 있을 때, 내가 그에게 말했다. 거두절미하고 (요점만)  단도직입적으로 말이다.\\n\\u3000“어제저녁에 아저씨가 돌아간 후에, 허버트에게 병사들이 늪지대(주인공의 마을 인근 늪지대, 교회묘지가 있음, 교회묘지에 주인공의 가족들 무덤이 있는 데 그 곳에서 12살의 주인공이 프로비스를 처음 만났었음)에서 아저씨를 발견한 이야기며 그때 아저씨가 싸우고 있었다는 얘기를 들려주었어요. 우리들이 다가갈 때 말이에요. 기억나세요, 아저씨?”\\n“기억이라고!” 그가 말했다. “네가 말한 그대로란다!”\\n\\u3000“아저씨가 싸우고 있었던 그 남성에 대해 알고 싶어요. 그리고 아저씨 자신에 대해서도요. 어제저녁에 허버트에게 들려준 이상은 제가 두 분 중 어느 쪽에 대해서도 특히 아저씨에 대해서 모르고 있다는 것이 이상해서요. 저희에게 말씀해주시기에 이만큼 좋은 때도 없을 것 같은 데요?”\\n\\u3000“글쎄다!” 뜸을 들인 후에 프로비스(57세, 죄수)가 말했다. “맹세할    수 있겠느냐, 핍의  친구야?”\\n“그렇고말고요.”라며  허버트가 대답했다.\\n\\u3000“내가  지금부터 어떤 얘기를 들려주든지 간에,” 프로비스가 주장했  다. “지금 그 맹세는  적용된다.”\\n“저도 그렇게 이해했습니다.”라며 허버트가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“그리고 이 점을 기억해두어라! 내 죄 값에 대한 지불은 노역(일하는 죄수)으로 모두 지불했음을 말이다.”라며 프로비스가 다시 한 번 강조 했다.\\n“그 말씀도 무슨 뜻인지 이해했습니다.”라며 허버트가 말했다. \\n\\u3000그가 검정색 파이프(피우는 ‘파이프’)를 꺼내들었다. 그리곤 ‘가루○ 배’로 파이프 안을  채워나갔다.\\n\\u3000그때 그의 눈에 자신의 손 안에 엉켜(????-_-;; 무슨 뜻인지 모름. 영어사전에 있는 대로 썼음. 아무런 생각이 없는 해석-_-;;생각이 없어~) 붙은 ‘가루○배’가 띈 것 같았다. 그가 당황한 것 같았다. 마치  그 엉켜있던 ‘가루○배’가 자신의 지난 삶을 되돌아보는 것을 헷갈리게 하는 마냥.\\n\\u3000그가 ‘가루○배’를 호주머니 안으로 도로 집어넣더니 들고 있던 파이프를 자신의 코트(외투) 상의 단추 구멍에 꽂았다.\\n\\u3000그가 두 손을 펴서는 무릎 위에 놓았다. 타오르는 눈빛으로 벽난로 위로 눈길을 돌리더니 잠깐의 침묵이 흐른 후, 그가 다시 우리에게로 고개를 돌려 다음과 같은 자신의 얘기를 들려주었다.

나도 살아야하지 않겠니. 뭔가를 내 뱃속으로 집어 처넣어야 되지 않았겠니?\\n\\u3000그래, 내가 점점 천해지고 있군. 그래 나도 고운 말이  뭔지  정도는  알고 있다.\\n\\u3000얘(23세, 주인공)야 그리고 핍(주인공이름)의 동료(23세, 이름이 ‘허 버트’)야, 내가 저급해질까 두려워 말거라.\\n\\u3000부랑자(떠돌아다님)가 되어 구걸을 하며 지내다 또 도둑질을 하고 가끔씩은 내가  할 수 있을 때 일을 하며 지냈단다. 비록 생각만큼 자주 일할 기회가 있었던 건 아니었지만 말이야. 너희들 같으면 나 같은 사람에게 일을 쉽게 줄 수 있으련 지 생각해 보면 될 거다.\\n\\u3000밀렵꾼 생활도 좀 했다. 막노동 일도 좀 했지. 짐마차를 끄는 마부일도 좀 했고, 건초(사료나 비료로 쓰려고 풀을 베어서 말린 것)더미 만드는 일꾼 노릇도 좀 했단다.\\n그러고 보니 행상(길거리에서 물건 파는 사람) 노릇도 좀 했군. 대부분은  돈은  안  되고  생고생만  줄  창  하는  일들이었지. 그러다 난 어른이  되었다.\\n\\u3000여관에 탈영한 병사가 하나 있었는데, 수많은 ‘다투라’(또는 ‘악마의 나팔꽃’이라고 부름 / 나팔꽃 같은데 열매를 맺으면 열대성과일처럼 둥글고 가시가 있음. 독성이 있음)들 속에 턱까지 숨어 지내던  병사였  지. 그가 내게 글 읽는 것을 가르쳐주었단다.\\n\\u30002천원에 한 번씩 자기 이름으로 서명을 해주며 여러 곳을 돌아다니던 어떤 거인에게서 글 쓰는 법을 배웠지.\\n\\u3000그때부터는 나도 이전만큼 그렇게 자주 철장 안에 갇히는 신세가 되진 않았단다. 하지만 여전히 감옥의 금속성 열쇠 키가 나 때문에 닳긴 닳고 있었지.\\n\\u3000대충 잡아 20년 전 일이다. 나는 ‘엡섬’(영국 ‘서리’ 주의 도시, 경마로 유명 / ‘서리’ 주는 런던 남서쪽에 인접해 있음)의 경마장에서, 어떤 작자(남성)와 안면을 트게  되었지.\\n\\u3000만약 그 자의 두개골이 이 벽난로의 선반 위에 있다면 나는 그 작자의 두개골을 이 부지깽이로 깨부술 수도 있단다. 바다가재의 집게발을 깨부수듯이 말이다.\\n\\u3000그 자의 진짜 이름은 ‘콤피슨’(철저한 사기꾼임 / 옥스퍼드 대학 출 신임)이다.\\n얘야, 그렇다. 그게 바로 네가 봤던 그 남성이다.\\n\\u3000내가 어제저녁에 돌아간 후 네가 네 동료(허버트)에게 올바르게 설 명해주었던 대로 그가 바로 내가 도랑(시궁창) 아래에서 부서져라 쳐대고 있던 그  사람이다.\\n\\u3000그는 자신을 영국신사라 떠벌리고 다니던 작자였지. 이 ‘콤피슨’(철 저한 사기꾼)이란 작자가  말이다.\\n\\u3000그는 옥스퍼드 대학교에도 다닌 적이 있는 꽤 배운 자였단다.(원문에는 사기꾼 “‘콤피슨’이 ‘공공 기숙학교’에도 다녔다”라고 나와 있는데 그냥 옥스퍼드 대학교를 다닌 걸로 바꾸었습니다. 물론 제 마음대로 바꾸었음. -_-;; 옥스퍼드가 더 멋지지 않나요?^^ 더 멋지네!!! 옥스퍼드 뭔가 있어 보임. 굿~ 잘 바꾸었음. 굿 초이스~)\\n\\u3000그는 붙임성도 있고 말솜씨가 좋은 소위 알랑거리는 작자였지. 특히 좋은 가문 사람들의 관례들엔 도가 터 있었지. 그는 또한 이목구비가 반반하게  잘생긴 작자였다.\\n\\u3000큰 경마가 있기 전날 밤이었다. 주변은 거친  잡초와 작은 야생화들만 널려 있던 들판이었다. 그곳 어느 식당의 칸막이된 자리에서 나를  그를  처음 발견했다.\\n\\u3000내가 식당 안으로 들어섰을 때 테이블들 사이로 그 자와 일행 몇 명이 더 앉아  있었다.\\n\\u3000식당주인이, 물론 이 자는 나도 알던 자다, 경마를 좋아하던 자였지, 이 식당주인이 그(콤피슨)를 큰 소리로 부르더니 이렇게 말하더구나.\\n“내 생각에 이 자가 당신 일에 적합할 것 같소.”라고. 물론 당신이란 나를 지칭하는 것이었다.\\n\\u3000콤피슨, 그자가 나를 유심히 쳐다보더구나, 그래서 나도 그를 쳐다보았지.\\n\\u3000그는 멋진 시계와 시곗줄을 지니고 있었다. 반지도  끼고 있었고 가슴엔 넥타이핀도 달고 있었다. 한 마디로 멋진 정장을 착용하고 있는 사나이였다.\\n\\u3000“겉모습만 보고 판단하건대, 자넨 운과는 거리가 먼 삶을 살아 왔군.”라며 콤피슨이 내게  말했다.\\n\\u3000“예, 어르신, 전 단 한 번도 운과 가깝게 지내 본 적이 없습니다요.” 그땐 내가 부랑죄(일정한 주거지와 직업 없이 이 지역 저 지역을 떠 돌아다니면  매를  때리고  수감했었음)에  걸려  킹스턴  교도소에 수감되\\n어 있다 막 출소했을 때였지.\\n\\u3000그 밖에 다른 죄로 수감되지 않았을 리가 없지만 일단은 부랑죄였을 게다.\\n\\u3000“운들은 바뀌는 법이지.” 콤피슨이 말했단다. “아마 자네의 운도 바뀔  것 같군.”\\n내가 말했지. “제발 그렇게만 되면 좋겝쇼. 자리(여지)는 있습죠.” \\n“그래 무슨 일을 할 수 있는가?”라며 콤피슨이 말하더군.\\n\\u3000“먹고 마시는 거요.”라며 내가 말했지. “만약 어르신께서 일거리(재료)만  찾아주신다 면요.”\\n\\u3000콤피슨이 웃더구나, 그러더니 다시 나를 유심히 쳐다보았지. 그리곤 나에게 10만원을 주더구나. 그러면서 내일 밤에 다시 보자고 하더군. “바로 이 장소에서”라며.\\n\\u3000다음 날 밤 같은 장소로 나(프로비스, 죄수)는  콤피슨(철저한 사기꾼)을 찾아갔다.\\n\\u3000그리고 콤피슨이 나를 고용했지. 자기 하인이자 짝패(범죄 패거리)로 삼았지.\\n우리가 짝패가 된 콤피슨의 사업이 무엇이었냐고?\\n\\u3000콤피슨의 사업은 사기, 다른 사람이 써놓은 글씨 위조, 도난당한 잉 글랜드(중앙은행) 은행권(지폐)을 유통하는 것 따위의 짓이었단다.\\n\\u3000콤피슨이 자신의 머리로 짤 수 있는 모든 종류의 덫(함정)들이 콤피슨의 비즈니스가 되었단다. 그럼 자기 자신은 드러나지 않게 하면서 수익은 다 챙기고 다른 사람을 자기 대신 꼼짝 못할 처지에 빠뜨리곤  했지.\\n\\u3000그는 이 철 부지깽이만큼이나 심장이 없는 인간이었단다. 그는 죽음 만큼이나 차가운 남자였지. 그는 앞서 말한 그 악마의 머리를 가진 작 자(사람)였다.\\n\\u3000콤피슨(사기꾼)에게 친근하게  굴고 있는 또 다른 사람이 있었지. 그의 이름은 ‘아서’(주연이 아니고 조연임)였다. 아서는 세례명이 아니라 그의 성(이름)이었단다.\\n\\u3000그는 쇠약할 때로  쇠약해진 상태였다. 유령 같은 몰골을 하고  있었지.\\n\\u3000아서와 콤피슨은 그 수년 전에 어떤 부유한 숙녀를 상대로 나쁜 일 (‘결혼을 빙자한 금전적인 사기행각’)을  벌였단다.\\n\\u3000그 일로 그들은 돈방석에 앉게 되었지. 하지만 그 많던 돈들도 콤피슨이 경마니 도박이니 게임이니 하며 써대는 통에 얼마 못가 세금 낼 돈도 없을 정도로 돈을 몽땅 다 탕진해버린 상태였다.\\n\\u3000그렇게 아서는 몸이 쇠약해저 죽어가고 있었고 찢어지게 가난한 데다 정신이상까지 보이고  있었다.\\n\\u3000콤피슨의 아내는 동정할 수 있을 때면 아서를 불쌍하게 여기더구나. 물론 그녀가 콤피슨에게 걷어차이지 않을 때면 말이다.\\n\\u3000그리고 콤피슨은 어떠한 것에도 어느 누구에게도 동정심이라곤 베풀지  않고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나(프로비스, 죄수)는 아서(아픈 사람)를 본보기로 삼을 수도 있었지. 하지만  그러질 못했단다.\\n\\u3000얘(23세, 주인공)야 그리고 핍(주인공이름)의 동료(23세, 허버트)야, 그때 내 자신만은 예외일거라 생각했다느니 하는 따위의 변명은 하지 않겠다. 그런다고 좋아질 게 뭐 있겠느냐?\\n\\u3000그렇게 나는 콤피슨(옥스퍼드 대학을 나온 철저한 사기꾼)과 비즈니스를 시작했다. 나는 그의 손에 쥐어진 덜 떨어진 도구였다.\\n\\u3000당시 콤피슨의 집은 브렌트퍼드(지명이름) 너머 인근에 있었다. 아서 (사람이름)는 그 콤피슨의 집 맨 꼭대기 층에서 기거하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000콤피슨은 아서(아픈 사람)의 하숙비를 매우 꼼꼼하게 기록하게 있었단다. 혹시라도 아서가 건강해져 일을 하게 되었을 경우에 대비해서 말이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 아서(아픈 사람) 용의 장부는 곧 마감이 되었지(금방 죽었다는 의미).\\n\\u3000그게 아마 내가 아서(사람이름)를 두 번짼가 세 번째로 보았을  때였다.\\n\\u3000밤늦은 시각에 아서가 콤피슨(사기꾼)의 응접실로 뛰어들어왔다. ‘플란넬’(‘면’과 ‘양의 털’을 썩어 만든 가벼운 천) 가운(잠옷)만  입고  있는 상태였다. 그의 머리는 온통 땀들로 뒤범벅이 된 상태였다.\\n아서(아픈 사람)가 콤피슨(사기꾼)의 아내에게 말하더구나. “샐리(‘사라’라는 이름의 ‘애칭’임), 그녀가 지금 내 주위를 어슬렁거\\n리고 있어. 위층에 있다고. 도저히 그녀를 떨쳐버릴 수가  없어.  그녀 는… 그녀는 온통 새하얀 옷을 입고 있단 말이야.”\\n아서가  계속 말했지.\\n\\u3000“그녀가 머리에 흰, 흰 꽃(신부용 꽃들을 말함)을 꽂았어. 미친 것 그녀라고. 그녀는 자신의 팔에 수의(시체에 입히는 옷)까지 축 늘어뜨 리고 있을 정도야. 이렇게 읊조리고 있어. ‘이 수의(시체 옷)를 당신에게 걸치고 말겠어요.’라고, 그 시간이 내일 아침 5시야.”\\n그러자  콤피슨(사기꾼)이 말했지.\\n\\u3000“아니, 이 등신아! 그녀가 살아 있는 거 몰라? 그런데 어떻게 거기까지 올라 가냐? 방문도 통과하지 않고서 응! 그렇지 않음 창문으로 들 어갔냐? 왜 계단으로 올라간 것 같다고 말하려고?”\\n\\u3000“나도 그녀가 어떻게 거기에 있는지 몰라.”라며 아서(아픈 사람)가 공포에 질려 사시나무 떨 듯 떨며 말하더구나.\\n아서가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“하지만 그녀는 지금 분명 내 침대 발치에 서 있었어, 정말 미쳐 있다고. 그리고… 그리고 심장이 떨어져나가 있어, 그 자리에…, 당신(콤 피슨)이 그렇게 했잖아! 그 자리에 핏방울들이 있어.”\\n콤피슨(사기꾼)은 말은 억세게 했지만, 하지만 예전부터 검쟁이였지. 그래서 콤피슨은 자기 아내에게  말했지.\\n\\u3000“(아내를 보며) 계속 쓸데없는 말들이나 해대는 이 병자를 따라 올라가 봐. 그리고 (매그위치를 보며 / 매그위치=프로비스=죄수=42장의 화자) 매그위치, 이 사람(콤피슨의 아내) 좀 도와주겠나?”\\n그러면서도 콤피슨 자기 자신은 그 근처에도 가지 않으려했지. \\n\\u3000콤피슨(사기꾼)의 아내(이름이 ‘샐리’, 이름 알 필요 없음)와 나는 아 서(아픈 사람)를 데리고 올라가 그를 다시 침대에 눕혔지. 그러는 동안에도 아서는 미친 듯이 악을 쓰며 고래고래 소리를 질러댔단다.\\n“저기 그녀가 보여! 그녀를 좀 봐.”라며 소리치더구나.\\n\\u3000“그녀가 나를 보며 수의(시체에 입히는 옷)를 흔들고 있어! 왜 그래, 그녀가 안 보인단 말이야? 그녀의 저 눈 좀 보라고 제발! 저토록 미쳐 있다니, 너무 끔찍해, 너무 끔찍해!”\\n그는 다음에 이렇게  소리치더구나.\\n\\u3000“그녀가 기어이 저 수의를 내게 입힐 거야. 그럼 난 결단 나는 거야! 제발 그녀를 내게서 좀 멀리 떼어줘, 제발 떼어달라고!”\\n\\u3000그러더니 그가 우리의 손을 붙잡았지. 입과 눈으로는 계속해서 그녀에게 말을 하고 대답을 하면서 말이다.\\n\\u3000어찌나 참혹하든지 나는 실제로 내가 그녀를 보았다고 믿을 정도였다.\\n\\u3000늘 하든대로 ‘콤피슨(사기꾼)의  아내’가  아서(아픈 사람)에게 공포에서 벗어나라며 약간의 알코올을 주었다네. 그도 차츰 안정을 되찾더군. \\n\\u3000“오,  그녀가 사라졌어요!  간수(지키는 사람)가 그녀를 데려간 거요?”\\n라며  그가 말했지.\\n“그래요.”라며 콤피슨의  아내가 말해주었네.\\n\\u3000아서(아픈  사람)가 말했지. “당신이 간수(사람)에게  그녀를 철장 안에 가두고 빠져나오지 못하게 시킨 거요.”\\n“네.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 제발이지 그녀에게서 저 끔찍한 물건(핏방울이 있는 산산조각난 심장) 좀 치우라고  말해주시오?”\\n“네, 네, 알았어요.  그럴게요.”\\n\\u3000“당신은 좋은 사람이에요.”라며 아서가  말하더군.  “무슨 일이 있어도, 나 혼자만 있게 하지 말아 줘요. 그리고 매번 고마워요!”\\n\\u3000새벽 5시가 되기 몇 분 전이었네. 그때까진 아서(아픈 사람)도 안정을 거의 되찾은 상태였지. 하지만 5시가 되자 그가 비명을 질러대기 시작하더군. 그러면서 이렇게  고함질렀네.\\n\\u3000“그녀가 다시 나타났어! 그녀가 내게 다시 수의(시체에 입히는 옷)를 내밀고 있소. 앗, 그녀가 수의를 펼치고 있어. 그녀가, 그녀가 구석에 서부터 나오고 있단 말이오. 이젠 침대까지 왔다고. 제발 나를 붙잡아 주오, 당신들(‘매그위치’와 ‘콤피슨의 아내’)이 내 한 쪽씩 잡아달란 말이오. 제발 그녀가 내 몸에 손대지 못하게 해주오. 호, 저번에는 그녀가 나를 놓쳤지. 그러니 이번에도 그녀가 내게 수의를 던지지 못하게 해주오. 제발  그녀가 나를 들어 올려  저 수의를 내 몸에 걸치지 못하게 해주오. 아, 그녀가 나를 들어 올리고 있소. 나를 제발 내버려둬! 제발 나 좀 눌러주시오! 제발!”\\n\\u3000그때 그가 바싹 곤두선 자세로 자신의 몸을 일으켰네. 그리고 그는 죽었네.\\n\\u3000콤피슨(사기꾼)이 말했네. “잘 갔지 뭐야! 이건 그와 나 양쪽 모두를 위해서도 잘 된 일이야. 속이 다 시원하군!”\\n콤피슨과 나(프로비스=죄수, 42장의 전달자)는 곧 바빠졌네.\\n\\u3000우선 그가 나에게 내 자신의 책에다가 맹세를 시겼네. 그는 언제나 교활했으니까.

(유치장과 구치소 모두 재판에서 정식으로 판결나기 전에 가두어지는 곳)\\n\\u3000그리고 재판이 피고(범인) 진술로 들어서자, 콤피슨은 자신의 하얀 손수건에 이따금씩 자신의 얼굴을 파묻으면서 진술을 했단다. 물론 그는 그러면서도 “아!”, “어!”, “야!”하는 유의 단어들을 자신의 진술 속에 넣었지.\\n\\u3000하지만 내가 내 자신의 진술에서 써먹을 수 있었던 건 고작, “신사 여러분들, 제 옆에 있는 이 자야 말로 가장 지독한 악당입니다요.” 뿐 이었단다.\\n\\u3000배심원의 평결이 나왔을 때였다. 좋은 성격과 나쁜 친구(매그위치 자기 자신) 그리고 그가 나에 대해 제출할 수 있었던 모든 법정정보들 때문에 자비를 받도록 추천받은 것은 콤피슨(사기꾼)이었단다.\\n\\u3000그리고 나는 오직 그들에게서 “유죄”라는 단어만을 들을 수 있었을 뿐이다.\\n그렇게 되자 내가 콤피슨(사기꾼)에게  말했지.\\n“이 법정을 나서자마자 네 놈의  낯짝(얼굴)을  박살내주겠다!”라고. 그러자  콤피슨(사기꾼)은  재판장에게  “저를  보호해주십시오”라고 간청했지. 그리고 두 명의 교도관들이 우리 둘 사이에 배치되게 되었단    다.\\n\\u3000곧 판사의 선고가 내려졌다. 콤피슨에겐 “7년 형”이 선고되었단다. 그리고 나는 “14년 형”을 선고받았지.\\n\\u3000판사가 콤피슨에 대해 이렇게 말하더구나. “아주 잘 될 수도 있었던 사람인데,  안 됐소.”라고.\\n\\u3000그리고 판사는 나에 대해서도 한 마디 했단다. “폭력적인 성향을 지닌 저 상습범은 앞으로도 더 나쁜 죄를 저지를 위험성이 다분할 것으로 생각되오.”라고.\\n\\u3000콤피슨(사기꾼)은 짐짓 자기 자신이 극도의 흥분 상태에 있는 듯 연 기했단다. 그러면서도 자신의 감정을 억누르는 듯 2~3번 가쁜 숨을 몰아쉬더니 종종 침을 꼴깍꼴깍 삼키면서 내 쪽으로 자신의 손을 내밀 면서 나를 안심시키려는 듯 한 태도를 취하며 이렇게 말했지.\\n“이봐 자네, 나는 천해지지 않을 걸세!”라고.\\n\\u3000이 과정에서 콤피슨(사기꾼) 그 자는 자기 자신을 너무 격하게 만들다보니 얘기를 계속 진행하기 전에 자신의 손수건을 꺼내 자신의 얼굴과 머리 그리고 목과 두 손을 닦아야했을 정도였단다.\\n\\u3000내(매그위치=프로비스=죄수=42장 이야기의 전달자)가 콤피슨(사기 꾼)에게 “네 놈을 박살내고 말겠다.”라고 말했을 때, ‘하느님 제발 저  놈을 박살낼 수 있게 해주십시오. 그럼 하느님께서 저를 박살내도 좋습니다!’라고 기원했지.\\n\\u3000우리는 같은 ‘감옥 선’(배)에 올랐지. 하지만 오랫동안 기회를 엿볼 수가 없었네. 비록 내가 시도를 했지만 말이야.\\n\\u3000마침내 내가 녀석의 뒤로 몰래 갈 수 있을 때 난 녀석의 뺨을 후려갈겨 녀석이 돌아보게 했지. 그러고 나서 놈을 묵사발로 만들었네. 결국 내 행위는 발각되고 난 갇혔지.\\n\\u3000감옥 선의 ‘감금소’는 그리 튼튼하지 못했다네. 그래서 바다에 뛰어들어 수영할 수 있을 거라 판단했지.\\n\\u3000나는 실행에 옮겼고 해안가로 탈출할 수 있었네. 그리곤 그 곳에 있던 무덤(주인공의 부모님과 친누나 그리고 어릴 적에 죽은 동생5명과  그 지역 마을사람들의 무덤이 있는 교회 부속의 묘지들을 말함 / 그 곳에서  12세의  주인공이  탈옥수  매그위치와  콤피슨을  처음 만나면서\\n『 위대한 유산 』 이란 소설이 시작이 됨)들 사이로 몸을 숨기고 있었지. 결과가 정해져 그곳에 누워있는 자들을 부러워하고 있을 때, 난 얘\\n(12세 때의 주인공)를 처음 만난 것이야! \\n\\n\\u3000(주인공의 독백 시작→) 매그위치(=프로비스=죄수)가 애정이 담긴 눈빛으로 나를 쳐다보았을 때 나는 다시 한 번 불쾌감을 느꼈다. 비록 내가 그의 이야기에 큰 연민을 느꼈다손  치더라도 말이다.  (너무 함부  로 해석하는 거 아냐? ~^^;; 뭐 어쨌든ㅋㅋ 계속 이런 식으로 진행시 키기로~)\\n(주인공의 독백 끝) \\n\\n(매그위치의  이야기 다시 계속)\\n\\u3000이 애(12세 때의 주인공)를 통해, 나는 콤피슨이란 작자(놈)도 감옥  선을 탈옥해 늪지대(주인공의 마을 인근 늪지대, 교회묘지가 있음, 교회묘지에 주인공의 가족들 무덤이 있는 데 그 곳에서 12살의 주인공이 프로비스를 처음 만났었음)로 숨어든 것을 알았다.\\n\\u3000맹세하건데 그 자식은 내가 녀석을 가만 두지 않을 것임을 알고 깜짝 놀라  내게서 탈출을 시도한 것일 게다. 물론 녀석은 내가  이미 감옥 선을 탈옥해 해안가로 숨어든 사실을 모른 채였지.\\n\\u3000나는 미친 듯이 끝까지 녀석을 추적했다. 그리곤 녀석의 얼굴을 묵사발을 만들었지.\\n내가 콤피슨(사기꾼)에게 이렇게  말했지.\\n\\u3000“지금 당장, 내가 할 수 있는 가장 악독한 짓을 네 놈에게 하겠다. 내 손을 빌릴 필요도 없다. 난 네 놈을 끌고 감옥 선으로 되돌아갈 테니까.”\\n내가  계속 말했지.\\n“가능한 한 있는 힘껏 헤엄쳐가겠다. 네 놈의 머리채를 끌고서라도 가겠다.”라고.\\n\\u3000만약 그때 너희들이 오지 않았더라도 나는 병사들의 도움 없이도 녀석을 끌고 감옥 선으로 돌아갔을 것이다.\\n\\u3000물론 젠장, 그 자는 법정에서 판사가 말한 대로 “그 놈의 성격이 아주 좋다”는 사실을 마지막까지 최대한 활용했지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000결국 내 존재와 내 살해 의도들에 겁을 먹고 반쯤 정신이 나간 상태에서 그 자가 탈옥한 것으로 되었지. 그래서 그 자에겐 가벼운 처벌이 내려졌다.\\n\\u3000반면 난 철장행이였지. 그리고 나는 다시 재판에 회부되었고 그러다 결국 종신유형(평생 섬에 보내 가둬버림)에 처해졌지.\\n\\u3000하지만 여기 이렇게 있으니 죽을 때까지 머무르지는 않았구나, 얘 (23세의 주인공)야 그리고 핍의 친구(23세의 허버트)야.\\n\\u3000그가 다시 얼굴이며 목이며 머리를  닦았다. 전에 한 동작 그대로였다. 그런 다음 자신의 호주머니에서 마구 엉켜서 묶여져 있는 가루○배를 천천히 꺼냈다. 그리고 단추 구멍에서  파이프(피우는 파이프)를 잡아 뽑았다. 그가 가루○배로 파이프 안을 천천히 채우더니 곧 ○배를  피우기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000“그(사기꾼인 ‘콤피슨’)가 죽었나요?” 잠시 침묵이 흐른 후 내가 물 었다.\\n“누가 죽었단 말이냐, 얘야?” “콤피슨(사기꾼)이요.”\\n\\u3000“그 자라면 내가 죽었길 바랄게다. 만약 그 작자가 살아 있다면 말이다. 넌 그것을 확신해도 좋을 게다.” 매그위치가 무서운 눈빛으로 나를 쳐다보며 말했다. “나는 그때 이후론 그에 대해 어떠한 얘기도 듣지 못했단다.”\\n\\u3000허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)가 책 표지에다가 자신의 연필로 뭐라고  적고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그가 천천히 그 책을 내 쪽으로 밀며 보여주었다. 그건 프로비스(= 매그위치=죄수=57세)가 막 벽난로를 바라보고 파이프를 피우며 서 있을 때였다.\\n내가 천천히 그 글자를 읽어 내려갔다.\\n\\u3000“아니?

그래 잘 지냈나? 난 또 어느 자식이 벽난로를  막고  있나 싶었지.”\\n\\u3000이 말과 함께 내가 부지깽이(집게)를 불 속으로 무시무시하게 쿡 찔러댔다. 그 일을 다 한 다음, 나는 어깨를 쭉 펴고서 등을 벽난로로 향한 다음 드러믈과 함께 나란히 자리를 잡고섰다.\\n\\u3000“이제 막 내려온 건가?” 드러믈 씨가 자신의 어깨로 나를 약간 밀어제치며 말했다.\\n“그래.” 내가 내 어깨로 다시 그를 약간 밀어제치며 말했다. \\n\\u3000“불쾌한 곳이군. 짐승 같은 곳이야.” 드러믈이 말했다. “자네 고향이 이 어디쯤이랬지?”\\n\\u3000“맞아.” 내가 동의하며 말했다. “하지만 자네 고향 ‘슈롭셔’(리버폴과 버밍엄 중간쯤에 있음 / 그러니까 영국중서부에 있는 카운티)도 만만치 않다고 들은 것  같은데.”\\n“아니, 조금도 닮지 않았네.”라며 드러믈이 말했다.\\n\\u3000얘기가 이딴 식으로 진행되자 녀석이 자기 부츠를 내려다보았다. 나도 내 부츠를 내려다보았다. 다음 녀석이 내 부츠를 못마땅한 듯 째려 보았다. 그래서 나도 녀석의 부츠를 못마땅한 듯 쳐다보았다.\\n\\u3000“여기 오래 있었나?”라며 벽난로에서 단 1cm(센티미터)도 밀려나지 않으려고 작심한 상태에서 내가  물었다.\\n\\u3000“충분히 지겨워질 만큼 오래 있었지.”라며 드러믈이 하품을 하는 척 하면서 말했다. 하지만 실은 이 녀석도 방금 나와 똑같은 생각이었다.\\n“그럼 여기 계속 머무를 건가?”\\n“말할 수 없지.” 드러믈이 대답했다. “그래 자넨?” “말할 수 없지.” 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 부분(대화)에서 피가 따끔거렸기 때문에 만약 드러믈 이 자식의 어깨가 머리털 한 올만큼의 너비라도 더 자기 거라고 주장했다면 내가 분명 그를 낚아채 창문으로 던져버렸을 것이다.\\n\\u3000마찬가지로, 내가 이 부분에서 내 어깨를 머리털 한 올만큼의  너비라도 더 내 것이라고 주장하려들었다면 녀석이 나를 낚아채 가장 가까 이에 있던 상자 속으로 나를 던져버렸을 것이다.\\n녀석이 살짝 휘파람을 불었다. 그래서 나도 휘파람을 불었다.\\n\\u3000“이 근처에 꽤 넓은 늪지대(주인공의 마을 인근 늪지대)가 있다며?” 드러믈이 말했다.\\n“그래. 그래서 뭐?” 내가  말했다.\\n\\u3000드러믈 씨가 썩은 미소를 날리며 나를 보았다. 그런 다음 그가 내  부츠를 내려다보았다, 그러더니 녀석이 “흥!”이라며 콧방귀를 뀌었다. (디킨스가 쓴  그대로  해석하면 → 〈 드러믈  씨가  “오!”하며 소리 내어\\n웃었다. 〉 임 -_-;; 왜 “흥!”이라는 콧방귀로 바꾸었는지 저도 모르겠네요. “웃었다”보다는 “콧방귀를  뀌었다”가  어울릴  것  같아서~ 완전히 내 마음대로 막가는  해석~)\\n\\u3000 “(갑자기 높임말로) 재미 있으신가보군요, 드러믈 씨?” 내가 말했다. “아니,”라며 드러믈이 말했다. “별로야. 말 타고 이 동네를 한 바퀴 돌아봐야겠어. 늪지대부터 돌아보는  게  좋겠는데.  재미있을 것 같아. 저 쪽에 외딴 마을들이  있다지,  사람들이  그러더군. 작고 특이하게 생긴 선술집들이며… 대장간들이며… 그런 것들 말이야.

오늘은 내가 그 숙녀분의 집에서 정찬(코스요리)을 들 거니까.”\\n“분부대로 하겠습니다, 나리.” \\n\\u3000그때, 드러믈(24세, 주인공의 라이벌)이 나를 힐끔 쳐다보았다. 비대하게 큰 아래턱을 가진 그의 얼굴에 오만한 승리감이 만발했다. 그것이 내 가슴에 사무쳤다. 저 아둔한 자식이… 나를 몹시 화나게 하고 있었다. 그래서 내가 녀석을 팔로 낚아채 벽난로 불 속에 녀석을 눕혀 버리고 싶은 충동을 느꼈다. 마치 영국 아동용 동화책에 나오는 ‘딕 터핀’이라는 노상강도가 노파(노부인)를 그렇게 벽난로 불 속에 넣겠다며 돈을 요구한 것처럼 말이다.(← 이 마지막 문장 확 빼려다 그냥 소설이 니까 남겨두었습니다. -_-;; 이 마지막은 다름이 아니라, 이 소설 『 위 대한 유산 』 이 집필되기 약

노부인에게서 돈이  어디에  있는지를 듣고 2층으로  가 돈  몽땅  훔치고 지하층으로 가서 술  마시고 다시 다  른 집으로 가서 강도질을 했다는 기사가 주간저널에 실린 것을 디킨스    가 인용한 것입니다. 이 악명 높았던 강도이름은 ‘딕 터핀’인데 이 사람이 경찰에 붙잡혀 교수형에 처해지고 나서 그의 도주소실과 범행들이 기사화되고 소설로 쓰이면서

하나는 우리 둘 모두에게 분명했다. 즉, 무슨 건수가 생기기 전에는, 우리 둘 다 절대 벽난로를 양보할 수 없었다는 것이다.\\n\\u3000우리는 벽난로에서 어깨를 펴고, 어깨  대 어깨,  발  대  발로  맞서며  두 손은 뒷집을 지고서 단 1cm(센티미터)도 꿈쩍 않고 있었다.\\n\\u3000비가 보슬보슬 내리는 가운데 문가에 서 있는 말이 보였고, 내 아침 식사가 테이블 위에 차려져 있었다. 드러믈의 식사 테이블은 치워져 있었다. 웨이터가 “식사가 준비됐습니다, 나리.”라며 나를 부르기 시작 했고 나는 고개를  끄떡여주었다.\\n그럼에도 우리 둘 모두 자기 자리를 고수하고 있었다. \\n\\u3000“그래 그 이후로 ‘작은 숲’(드러믈과 주인공이 속한 먹고 마시고 죽자 식의 20대 초반 런던신사들의 놀자 클럽)에는 가본 적이 있나?” 드러믈(24세, 주인공의 라이벌)이  말했다.\\n\\u3000“아니.” 내가 말했다. “지난번 거기에 있었을 때 ‘핀치 새’(‘클럽구성원’을 의미함)들에게 충분히  질렸거든.”\\n“그날이 우리가 의견 차이를 보이던 때인가?” “맞네.” 내가 아주 간결하게  대답했다.\\n\\u3000“아니, 이봐! 핀치 새들이 자넬 너무 쉽게 풀어주었어.” 드러믈이 비웃으며 말했다. “무엇보다 자넨 그때 화를 내선 안 되었었어.”\\n\\u3000“드러믈 씨.”라며 내가 말했다. “그 주제라면 남 말 할 때가 아닐 텐데. 나는 화가 난다고 상대방에게 와인 잔을 집어 던지지는 않네. 이 경우에도 내가 그 날 화를 냈다는 걸 인정하는 것은 아니네.”\\n“나는 집어던지지.” 드러믈이 말했다. \\n\\u3000피가 거꾸로 솟구치는 것 같은 흉포한 심리상태에서 녀석(드러믈)을  한 번 또는 두 번 더 흘낏 쳐다본 후, 내가 감정을 억누르며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“드러믈 씨(24세, 주인공의 라이벌), 이 대화는 내가 청한 것이 아니네, 그리고 나는 이 대화가 기분 좋은 대화라고 생각지도 않네.”\\n\\u3000“물론 쾌활한 대화는 아니지.” 녀석이 자기 어깨 너머로 오만하게 말했다. “나는 그것에 대해 아무것도 생각 하지 않네.”\\n\\u3000“그래서,”라며 내가 계속 말을 이어갔다.  “미안하네만, 앞으로는 우리 사이에 어떠한 종류의 의사소통도 이루어지지 않기를 제안하는 바이네.”\\n\\u3000“전적으로 동의하는 바이네.” 드러믈(24세, 주인공의 라이벌)이 말했다. “내가 먼저 제안했어야  할 것을…, 아니 오히려… 제안  없이도  바로 실행했어야 했는데. 하지만 침착함을 잃지는 말게.  그러지 않아도  자넨 앞으로 잃어야 할 게 많지 않은가?”\\n“방금 한 그 말이 어떤 의미에서 나온 말인지 물어야겠네, 형씨?”    \\n“흥,  (웨이터를 쳐다보며) 웨이터!” 드러믈이  내게  대답하는 대신 웨이터를

드세요. 다 식어가요.’(← ‘ ’ 안의 문장은 제가 그냥 재미로 추가한 문장입니다)라며 애원하듯 나를 바라보았다. 그러더니 나가 버렸다.\\n\\u3000내 어깨에 밀리지 않으려고 주의를 기울이며, 드러믈(24세, 주인공의 라이벌)이 자신의 호주머니에서 ○가(담○잎을 돌돌 말아서 만든 담○) 하나를 꺼내더니 그 끝을 물어뜯어냈다. 하지만 전혀 움직일 기색은 없어보였다.\\n\\u3000(43장의 계절은 가을에서 겨울로 막 들어서 매서워지기 시작하던 때임) 녀석의 담배에 숨이 막히고 등 뒤 벽난로 열기에 푹푹 찌던 나는 에스텔라의 이름을 꺼내지 않고는 우리 사이의 대화가 단 한 단어도  더 진행되지 못할 것임을  느꼈다.\\n\\u3000하지만 녀석이 그녀의 이름을 말하는 것은 내가 견딜 수 없었기 때문에, 그러므로 나는 반대쪽 편의 벽만 돌처럼 차갑게 쳐다보며 마치  지금 내 옆에 아무도 없는 듯 행동했다. 그러면서 나는 내 자신에게 제발 좀 침묵하고 있으라고(=에스텔라의 이름을 꺼내지 말라고) 강요 하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000호황을 누리고 있는 것 같은 세 명의 농장주가 그때 커피숍 안으로 들어오지 않았더라면 우리가 얼마나 오랫동안을 그런 말도

양보할 수밖에 없었다. \\n\\u3000드러믈(드러믈은 행동이 굼뜬 인물입니다.)이 자기 말의 갈기(목덜미의 털)를 잡는 장면이 창문을 통해 보였다. 녀석이 어색하고 난폭한 방식으로 말에 올랐다. 말이 주저주저하듯 옆걸음질 치며 뒤로 물러갔다. 지나가버렸다고 생각했을 때 녀석이 다시 나타났다. 잊고 있었던지 입에 물고 있던 시○(잎을 돌돌 만 담○)에 불을 붙여달라고 요구하고\\n있었다.\\n\\u3000다갈색(검은빛을 띤 갈색) 옷을 입고 있던 어떤 남성이 불을 가지고 나타났다. 그가 어디서 나타났을까? 알 수 없었다. 여관의 안뜰일 수도 있었다. 아님 거리일 수도 있고, 아님 다른 어딘가에서 나왔을 것이다. 드러믈이  말에서  몸을  아래로  숙이더니  시○(담○)에  불을  붙이곤\\n소리  내어 웃었다.\\n\\u3000드러믈이 커피숍 창문들 쪽으로 머리를 홱 움직였다. 드러믈에게 불을 붙여주던 남성의 구부정한 어깨와 누더기 같은 머리카락들이 보였다. 그 남성은 나와 등지고 있었다. 그의 뒷모습에 나는 올릭(36세, 사악한  악당)을 떠올렸다.\\n\\n43장은  여기서  끝입니다. 아래 내용은 제가 쓴  부연설명입니다.\\n\\u3000잠깐

주제는 이래저래 말 돌릴 필요도 없이, “주인공의 성공과 파멸, 그리고 주인공이 시종일관 우울한 시선에서 바라본 자신의 첫사랑 이야기”지만 런던신사가 되리라는 환상도 그리고 에스텔라와 결혼할 수 있으리라는 것도 모두 환상이었다. 하지만 아련했다. 뭐 이런 내용입니다. 주인공의 사랑을 받을 여인이 아니었던 거죠.  ㅜ_ㅜ\\n\\u3000행복은 뭔가 다른

거기서 전 에스텔라를 여기로 오게 한 어떤 바람의 발견하게 되었습니다. 그래서 뒤따라온 것입니다.”\\n미스 해비샴이 세 번 인가 네 번 내게 앉으라며 시늉을 해보였다. 나는 화장대 옆에 놓인 의자에 가 앉았다. 그 의자는 미스 해비샴이\\n종종  앉던 자리였다.\\n\\u3000내 다리와 내 주변으로까지 다가온 이 모든 파멸의 순간에 그 의자는 그 날 나를 위해 예정되어 있었던 자리 같았다.\\n\\u3000“미스 해비샴 마님, 전 에스텔라에게 할 말이 있어요, 그 얘기를 마님 있으신 데서 지금…, 곧 하겠습니다. 마님을 놀라게 할 얘기도 마님을 노하게할 얘기도 아닙니다. 전 지금 마님께서 바라신만큼이나 충분히 불행한 상태니까요.”\\n미스  해비샴은  계속해서  나를  견고하게  바라보고  있는  중이었다. 나는  에스텔라의  손가락들의  움직임에서  그녀가  뜨개질을 하면서도\\n내가 하는 말에 주의를 기울이고 있음을 알 수 있었다.  하지만 그녀는 나를  쳐다보지는 않았다.\\n\\u3000“저는 제 후원자가 누구인지를 알아챘습니다. 그것은 행운의 부적이 아니었습니다. 그건 저에게 명성을 주는 것도, 제 지위를 높이는 것도,  제 운을 틔어주는 것도, 아무것도 아니었습니다. 제가 그 이상을 말해서는 안 되는 이유들이 있습니다. 그건 저와 관련된 비밀이 아닙니다.  그건 누군가의 비밀이기  때문입니다.”\\n\\u3000내가 에스텔라를 쳐다보며 말을 어떻게 이어갈지를 생각하며 잠시 침묵을 지키고 있었기 때문에 미스 해비샴이 되풀이해 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그게 너의 비밀이 아니라 다른 누군가의  비밀이라는  거니.  그렇지?”\\n\\u3000“미스 해비샴 마님께서 저를 여기로 처음 부르셨을 때, 저는 저 너머에 있는 마을, 결코 제가 떠나오지 말았어야 할 마을에 살았습니다. 우연히 불러온 어떤 다른 소년의 자격으로, 결핍을 채워주고 변덕을 만족시켜주기 위해 그래서 그 보답으로 돈을 받는 그런 종류의 하인으 로서 저는 실제 여기로  불러왔겠지요.”\\n\\u3000“아아! 핍(23세, 주인공의 이름).” 미스 해비샴이 확고하게 고개를 끄떡여 보이며 대답했다. “그래 넌 그랬다.”\\n\\u3000“그리고 저 ‘재거스 씨’(런던 유명 변호사)가….” (부연설명 1 : 재거스 씨는 미스 해비샴의 재산관리 관련 법률 대리인이자, 주인공 핍의 후견인)(부연설명 2 : 재거스 변호사 = 주인공에게 유산을 물러주는 사람이 아니라 단지 주인공의 법률담당 후견인임. 주인공이 성년(영국의 경우 = 21세 이상)이 아니라서 유산을 법적으로 받을 수 있기까지 돌봐줄  후견인이 필요했음)\\n\\u3000“재거스 씨는,” 미스 해비샴이 강한 어조로 내게 이의를 제기하며 말했다. “그는 이 일과 아무런 관련이 없다, 아무 것도 아는 것이 없어. 그가 내 재산관리 변호사인 것과, 그가 네 후견인의 변호사인 것은 우연의 일치다. 그는 많은 사람들에 대해서도 똑같은 관계를 유지하고 있다. 너의 경우와 같은 우연은 언제든 일어날 수 있다. 그러함에도 불구하고 너에게 그 우연이 일어났다. 그건 누군가가 초래한 결과가 아니다.”\\n\\u3000이 시점까지 미스 해비샴의 수척한 얼굴에 어떠한 은폐도 또한 어떠    한 회피도 없다는 것은 누구나 알 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000“하지만 제가 이다지도 오래 유지하고 있는 착각에 빠져 있을 때, 적어도 마님께서는 저를 거짓말로  유혹하셨잖아요?”\\n\\u3000“그래,” 그녀가 다시 한 번 견실하게 고개를 끄떡이며 말했다. “그래 내가 너를 속인 것은 맞다.”\\n“그게 친절이었던가요?”\\n\\u3000“내가 누구냐,” 그녀가 갑자기 자신의 목발  지팡이로 바닥 위를 치며 말했다. 그녀가 너무도 갑작스레 분노를 표출했기 때문에 에스텔라까지 흠칫 놀라 미스 해비샴을 흘긋 올려다보았을 정도였다.\\n미스 해비샴이 계속  말했다.\\n\\u3000“내가 누구더냐, 오 하느님 맙소사, 내가 왜 친절을 베풀어야 하느냐?”\\n\\u3000그것은 힘이 약한 불평이었다. 그리고 나에겐 그럴 의도(불평을 할 의도)가 없었다.\\n\\u3000나는 이 얘기를 그녀에게 했고, 그녀도 이 감정폭발 이후엔 생각에 잠겨 음울하게 앉아  있었다.\\n“그래, 그래, 좋다!” 그녀가 말했다. “그밖에 또 있느냐?”\\n\\u3000“저는 이전에 여기서 시중 든 것에 대한 보답을 후하게 지불받았습니다.” 내가 그녀의 화를 누그러뜨리기 위해 말했다. “대장간 수습공(일을 배우는 직공)에게 있어서 그 보수는 아주 관대한 금액이었습니다.(미스 해비샴은 봉투 안에 1천2백5십 만원을 주인공의 매형에게 주 었음. 참조 13장 ▶ http://blog.naver.com/osy2201/10188752399 ) 그리고 방금 질문들은 대답을 바라지 않고 단지 참고로만 드린 질문들 이었습니다. 하지만 이어지는 질문들은 다른 의도에서 드리는 질문들입니다. 바라건대 사심없는 질문들이라 생각됩니다. 제 착각들을 어르고 달래시는 동안 마님께선 아마도 마님의 이기적인 친척들을 벌하셨 겠지요. 아님 그들을 상대로 책략을 꾸미셨던가요, 마님의 의도를 설명  할 수 있는 어떤 다른 단어가 있다면요.”\\n\\u3000“그래 내가 그랬다. 이런, 그들이 그것을  그런  식으로 받아들였다! 그건 너도 마찬가지다. 내가 어떻게 살아왔는데, 내가 왜 그들이나 너에게 그것을 그런 식으로 받아들이지 말라고 탄원하기 위해 노력해야 하느냐! 너희들은 너희 자신이 만든 올가미에 걸린 것이다. 나는 결코  그런 덫을 만든 적이  없다.”\\n\\u3000나는 그녀의 마음이 차분해질 때까지 기다렸다. 왜냐하면 이번에도 역시 그녀가 야생적이고 갑작스런 방식으로 벌컥 화를 냈기 때문이다. 그런 다음 나는 얘기를 계속했다.\\n\\u3000“저는 마님의 친척들 중 한 가족 속으로 내던져졌습니다, 미스 해비샴 마님. 저는 런던으로 상경한 이후 줄곧 그 가족 속에서 지내고 있습니다. 저는 정직하게 말해 그들이 저만큼이나 헛된 희망에 잡혀 있다는 것을 알게 되었습니다. 그래서 마님께서 받아들이시든 아니든 그리고 마님께서 제 말에 신빙성을 부여하시든 아니든 마님께선 매튜 포킷 씨(미스 해비샴의 친척.  23세의 미스 해비샴이 사기꾼 남성에게 빠져 허겁지겁 결혼하려하자 유일하게 끝까지 반대하다 미스 해비샴과 심하게 말다툼을 벌인 후 다시는 서로 안 만나고 있는 사이)와 그의 아들인 허버트(매튜 포킷 씨의 아들)를 철저하게  오해하고  계시다는 말을 하지 않을 수 없습니다. 만약 이 말을 마님께 하지 않는다면 그건 저의 부정과 열등감 탓일 테니까요. 만약 마님께서 그 두 사람이 관대하고 올바르며 열린  마음과  도무지  노림수와  비열함과는  동행할 수 없는 이들이라 생각하시지 않는다면 정말 마님께선 그들 두 사람을 오해하고  계신 것입니다.”\\n“그래, 그들은 네 친구들이다.” 미스 해비샴이 말했다.\\n\\u3000“제게 그들의 지위를 빼앗겼다고 생각되어질 때,” 내가 말했다. “그들은 스스로 제 친구들이 되어주었습니다. 그리고 제 생각에 세라 포킷(결혼하지 않은 주름투성이 노파. 소설 속에서 주인공의 신분에 중요한 변화가 있을 때마다 시기질투하며 현실의 문(저택의 진짜 현관문)을 열어주는 역할을 하는 엑스트라 / 알면 좋지만 몰라도 되는 이름임)과, 미스 조지아나(괜히 엄숙하게 보이려고 엄숙한 표정을 지어면서 뒤로 꿍꿍이를 꾸미는 여인 / 몰라도 되는 이름임), 그리고 카밀라(수다쟁이 여자 / 몰라도 되는 이름임) 부인은 제 친구들이  아니었습니다.  제  생각엔 그랬습니다.”\\n\\u3000나머지 사람들과 두 사람(‘허버트의 아버지’와 ‘허버트’)을 대비한 것이 기쁘게도 미스 해비샴에게 이롭게 작용한 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 잠시 나를 예민하게 쳐다보았다. 그런 다음 그녀가 조용히 다음과  같이 말했다.\\n“그래 내가 그들을 위해 어떻게 해주길 원하느냐?”\\n\\u3000“단지,” 내가 말했다. “단지 그들을 다른 사람들과 혼동해주시지만 않으면 됩니다. 비록 그들이 친척사이이지만 하지만 제가 보기에 그들의 타고난 품성까지 닮은 것은 아닙니다.”\\n\\u3000여전히 그녀가 나를 예민하게 관찰하고 있었다. 미스 해비샴이 되풀이해 물었다.\\n“그래 내가 그들을 위해 어떻게 해주길 원하느냐?”\\n\\u3000“전 교활하지 않습니다, 마님.” 내 얼굴이 약간 붉어지는 것을 느끼며 내가 말했다. “심지어 제가 의도할 때조차도 제가 무언가를 바라고 있다는 사실을 마님께 숨길 수 있을  만큼  전 약삭빠르질  못합니다.  미스 해비샴 마님, 만약 제 친구인 허버트(미스 해비샴의 ‘사촌 오빠’의 아들)가 살아 있을 때 영구적인 도움을, 그러니까 약간의 금전을 녀석 에게 할애해줄 수 있는지요. 하지만 이 경우(인도와의 무역사업)의 성격상 마님의 도움을 녀석이 몰라야합니다. 방법은 제가 설명해드릴 수 있습니다.”\\n\\u3000“왜 그 사실을 허버트가 몰라야 되느냐?” 미스 해비샴이 양 손을 자신의  목발  지팡이 위에 얹으며  말했다. 그건 좋은 신호였다. 내  말에  좀 더 많은 귀를 기울이고 있다는 증거였다.\\n\\u3000“왜냐하면요,” 내가 말했다. “제가 이미 2년 전부터 녀석 모르게 녀석의 사업을 돕고 있기 때문입니다. 이제 와서 제가 드러나는 것을 원치 않아서입니다. 이제 와서 그 일이 제 능력을 넘어선  이유를 설명해드릴 수는 없습니다.  단지 그것이  제가 아니라  또 다른  누군가와 연결 된 비밀의 한 부분이라는 말씀만 드릴 수 있을 뿐입니다, 마님.”\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴이 나에게서 시선을 점점 거두더니 벽난로의 불쪽으로 가져갔다.\\n\\u3000침묵과 천천히 소모되고 있는 초들의 불빛에 의해 그녀가 아주 오랫 동안 벽난로의 불빛을 바라보고 있은 듯이 느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000붉은 석탄들이 몇 개 다 타버렸다. 그 바람에 그녀의 의식이 다시 돌아왔다. 그녀가 다시 내 쪽으로 시선을 돌렸다. 우선 나는 그녀의 눈에서 공허함을 느꼈다. 곧 그녀의 눈빛이 점점 주의력을 회복했다.\\n이러는 내내 에스텔라는 뜨개질을 계속하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴이 이제 시선을 내게 확고하게 고정시키고 있었다. 그녀가 말했다. 그건 마치 우리 사이에 어떠한 대화단절도 없었다는 듯 확 고했다.\\n“그 밖에 또 있느냐?”\\n\\u3000“에스텔라,” 내가 이제 그녀에게로 고개를 돌리며 내 떨리는 목소리로 호소하고 있었다. 에스텔라. “넌 내가 널 사랑한다는 사실을 알고 있잖니. 난 너를 오래도록 그리고 비싼 대가를 치르면서도 사랑해왔어.  넌 알거야.”\\n\\u3000이런 식의 말을 건네자마자 그녀가 두 눈을 들어 내 얼굴을 바라봤다. 그녀의 손가락들은 뜨개질에 열중하고 있었다. 그녀가 흔들리지 않는 냉정한 얼굴표정을 한 채 나를 쳐다보고 있었다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴이 나에게서 눈을 떼어 그녀를 흘낏 쳐다보다 그녀에게서 눈을 떼 나를 다시 쳐다보았다.\\n\\u3000“좀 더 빨리 말했어야했어, 하지만 이미 늦었는걸. 내가 이토록 오랫 동안 미망에 젖어있지만 않았더라도. 그 미망이 나로 하여금 미스 해비샴이 우리들을 이어주려고 의도하고 있다고 생각하게 만들었으니까. 이를테면 너도 네 자신을 어찌할 수 없었을 거라 내가 생각하는 동안은 나도 이 말을 삼가 해왔던 거야. 하지만 이제 이 말만은 꼭 해야겠어.”\\n\\u3000여전히 흔들리지 않는 냉랭한 시선을 견지한 채 그리고 손가락들은 뜨개질을 계속하면서, 에스텔라가 고개를 가로 저었다(고개를 도리도리 흔들었다는 얘기).\\n\\u3000“나는 알아,” 내가 ‘그 행동(에스텔라의 흔들리지  않는  냉랭함)’에 대한 대답으로 이렇게 말했다. “나도 안다고. 내가 이제 너를 내 꺼라  부를 아무런 희망도 없게 되었음을 말이야, 에스텔라. 이제 곧 내가 어 떻게 될지, 그리고 내가 얼마만큼 가난해질지, 또는 내가 어디로 갈지 나는 몰라. 그럼에도 불구하고 나는 널 사랑해. 나는 너를 이 새티스 하우스에서 처음 만나 그 순간부터 사랑해왔어.”\\n\\u3000전혀 흔들리지 않는 냉랭한 시선을 한 채 나를 바라보며 손가락으로는 뜨개질을 치중하며 그녀가 다시 한 번 고개를 가로저었다(도리도리 흔들었다는 얘기).\\n\\u3000“만약 미스 해비샴이 자신이 하는 행동의 심각성에 대해 깊이 생각 해보서도, 이토록 수년 동안을 헛된 희망과 효과 없는 달음질로 고통 받도록 어느 가난한 시골 소년의 감수성을 획책한 것이라면, 그녀 안에 있는 잔인함은, 그 잔인함은 너무 무서운 잔인함인 거야. 하지만 그녀가 그 심각성을 충분히 되돌아보진 못했을 거라 생각해. 그녀 자신의 시련(23세에 사기꾼에게 사랑을 빙자해 돈사기를 당하고 버림받은 것)을 감내하느라 내가 겪는 시련은 잊은 거라 생각해, 아니니 에스텔라.”\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴이 자기 가슴에 손을 대는 것이 보였다. 그녀는 가슴에   손을 댄 체 나와 에스텔라를 번갈아가며 보고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“내가 어떻게 불러야 할지 모를 감정들, 바람들이 있는 것 같아.” 에 스텔라가 아주 침착한 어조로 말했다. “그건, 내가 이해할  수 없는  거야. 네가 나를 사랑한다고 말했을 때, 난 단지 그것을 낱말들의 조합으로써 이해했어. 하지만 그 이상은 아니었어. 넌 내 마음 속에 어떤 것도 불러일으키지 못했어. 내 마음에 닿지도 않았다고. 네가 하는 말에 개의치 않아. 내가 분명 이것에 대해 경고 했었잖니? 자, 아니었니?”\\n내가 비참한 어조로 말했다.  “그래.”\\n\\u3000“맞아. 그때 넌 내 경고를 듣지 않으려 했어. 왜냐고? 내게 경고의 의미가 없다고 넌 생각했으니까. 자, 그때 그렇게 생각하지 않았니?”\\n\\u3000“생각했어. 하지만 그게 사실이지 않길 바랐어. 넌, 너무 여렸고, 가냘팠고, 너무 아름다웠으니까, 에스텔라! 분명 그게  네  본심일리  없어.”\\n\\u3000“그게 내 본심이야.” 그녀가 대답했다. 그런 다음 그녀가 단어 하나 하나에 힘을 주며 다음과 같이 덧붙였다. “그것이 내 안에 자리 잡고  있는 본성이야. 내가 이렇게 말을 많이 하는 이유도 내가 너를 그나마 다른 모든 사람들과는 다르게 생각하기 때문이야.  하지만  그  이상은 나도  어쩔 수 없어.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 벤틀리 드러믈(24세)이 여기 이 마을에 있는 건 사실이 아니니, 그가 너를 쫓아다니고 있다는 것도 사실이 아니니?”\\n\\u3000“그건 전적으로 사실들이야.” 그녀는 완전한 경멸과 같은 무관심한 태도로 벤틀리 드러믈를 언급하며  말했다.\\n\\u3000“그럼 네가 그를 부추겨, 그와 함께 말을 타고 나간 일이며, 그리고  그가 바로 오늘 너와 정찬(코스요리)을 하기로 한 것은?”\\n\\u3000내가 그 사실들을 알고 있다는 것이 그녀에겐 약간 충격인 것 같았다. 하지만 곧 대답이 날아왔다. “전적으로 사실이야.”\\n“넌 그를 사랑할 수 없어, 에스텔라!”\\n처음으로 뜨개질을 하던 그녀의 손가락들이 멈추었다. 다소 화가 난 그녀가 앙칼지게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“내가 지금까지 뭘 말한 거니? 넌 내 말엔 귀도 기울이지 않아, 넌 여전히 내 말을 경고로 받아들이고 싶지 않은 거니?”\\n\\n\\n“그와 정말 결혼하려는 건 아니지, 에스텔라?”\\n\\u3000그녀가  미스 해비샴 쪽을 쳐다보았다. 그녀가 잠시  자신의 손에 들    려 있던 뜨개질에 대해 생각하는 듯했다.\\n그러더니  그녀가 말했다.\\n“왜 내가 네게 진실을 말하지 않겠니? 난 그와 결혼할 예정이야.”\\n\\n옮긴이 코멘트 :\\n\\u3000〈 하울의 움직이는 성 〉 〈 마녀 배달부 키키 〉 같은 미야자키 하야오의 작품들을 보고, 손 그림이 주는  따뜻함이랄까  작품의  완성도를 접한 상태로, 아직 눈이 떼어지지 않은 상태에서 제가 한 위대한 유산 해석을 보니 참 -_-;; 아마추어도 이런 아마추어가 없네요. 정말 수준 차이나서 -_ㅜ;; 견딜 수가 없음. ㅠ_ㅠ 빨리 마음 추스르고  위대한  유산  해석 계속 할  수 있기를 빔~ 이런 경우엔  시간이  약임~ 룰루랄라~ \\n\\u3000(옮긴이 코멘트 끝~)\\n\\n\\u3000내가 얼굴을 두 손에 파묻었다. 하지만 내가  예상했었던 것보다 더 잘 내 스스로를 조절하고 있었다. 그녀가 사용한 단어들을 듣는 것이  내게 얼마나 큰 고통을 주었는지를 고려한다면 말이다.\\n\\u3000내가 다시 얼굴을 들었을 때, 미스 해비샴의 얼굴엔 파랗게 질린 그런 표정이 담겨 있었다. 그것이 내게 깊은 인상을 주었다. 비록 내가 그때 격정적인 슬픔과 허둥댐을 느끼고 있었을 지라도 말이다.\\n\\u3000“에스텔라, 내가 사랑하는 에스텔라, 미스 해비샴이 네 자신을 구렁텅이로 몰아넣는 것을 허용하지는 마. 나를 제쳐놓아도 좋아. 넌 그렇게 해왔잖니. 그건 내가 더 잘 아는 사실이야. 하지만 제발 네 자신을 드러믈보단 더 가치 있는 남자에게 받쳐. 드러믈은 네가 선택한 남자가 아니야, 미스 해비샴이 단지 너를 그에게 준 것 뿐이야. 그건 미스 해비샴이 ‘너를 드러믈에게 보냄으로써’ 너를 사모하는 수많은 훌륭한 남성들과 너를 진실로 사랑해온 소수의 남성들에게 미스 해비샴이 가할 수 있는 최대의 모욕이자 상처이기 때문이야. 그 소수의 남성들 가 운데는 심지어 너를 나만큼이나 끔찍이 사랑한 사람이 있을 수 있어.  비록 그가 나만큼 널 오랫동안 지켜 오진 못했을 지라도. 제발 그런 사람에게 가. 그럼 내 마음이 이보단 더 잘 견딜 수 있을 테니까. 제발 너를 위해!”\\n\\u3000내 진심이 그녀 안에서 어떤 경이로움을 불러일으킨  것 같았다. 그녀가 만약 내 진심을 그녀 자신의 마음에 전부 이해시킬 수만 있었다면, 동정심에서 불러일으켜질 수 있을 그런 경이로움이었다.\\n\\u3000“아니, 난 그와,” 그녀가 다시 한 번 대답했다. 하지만 이번에는 보다 부드러운 목소리였다. “난 그와 결혼하기로 되어 있어. 나를 위한 결혼식 준비가 한 창 이루어져 있고, 난 곧 결혼하게 될 거야. 넌 왜  여기에 내 수양어머니(미스 해비샴은 에스텔라를 낳은 어머니가, 에스텔라가 갓난아이일 때 입양해 길러준 어머니임)의 이름까지 들먹이며 그녀에게 상처를 입히니? 그와의 결혼은 내 의사야.”\\n\\u3000“그게 네 의사라고, 에스텔라, 너 자신을 그런 짐승 같은 자식에게 내던져버리는 게?”\\n\\u3000“내가 누구에게 내 자신을 내던져야 하겠니?” 그녀가 미소를 띠며 반박했다. “그럼 내가 아무것도 그에게 가지고 가지 않았다는 사실을  가장 빨리 느낄 그런 남자 품에 내 자신을 내팽개쳐야하겠니? 만약 사 람들이 그런 감정들을

얼마나 불안하고 음울하며 길게만 느껴지던 밤인가!\\n\\u3000방안에는 식어버린 그을음과 달아오른 먼지들로 생긴 쾌쾌한 냄새가 났다.\\n\\u3000내 머리 위 침대 제단 위의 닫집 구석들을 올려보고 있자니 이건 뭐 정육점 가게에서 왔을 법한 무수히 많은 검정파리들과 시장에서 왔을  법한 무수히 많은 집게벌레들 그리고 시골에서 막 상경한 것 같은 땅 벌레들이 그곳에 거꾸로 매달려 있었다. 내년 여름을 맞이하기 위해 거기서 휴식을 취하고 있음이  분명해보였다.\\n\\u3000이것이 나로 하여금 일부 벌레들이 언젠가 아래로 떨어지는 것은 아 닌지 하는 추측을 하게 만들었고 곧 나는 내 얼굴 위로 가벼운 낙하들을 느꼈다고 생각하기 이르렀다. 이것에도 곧 불유쾌한 사고의 전환이 있었는데 뭔가가 내 등 위로 타고 오르는 것 같은 더 마음 내키지 않는 생각으로 이어졌기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000꽤 오랫동안 깬 체 누워 있었을 때였다. 고요함 속에 감추어져 있던 엄청난 소음들이 들려오기  시작했다.\\n\\u3000붙박이장(옷 넣어두는 곳)이 속삭였고, 벽난로가 한숨을 내쉬었으며, 자그마한 세면대는 똑똑 물 떨어지는 소리를 냈으며, 서랍장 안에 있던 기타 한 줄은 이따금씩 울렸다.\\n\\u3000그와 동시에 수많은 눈들(깡통 둥근 구멍을 통해  비춰진 양초 불빛) 이 벽들 위에서 새로운 표정을 지었으며 사방에서 나를 노려보는 듯한 그 눈들(양초 불빛들) 하나하나 안에는 이렇게 적힌 문구가 보였다.\\n〈집으로 가지 마시오.〉\\n\\u3000밤의 공상(상상)들과 소음들이 내 위로 아무리 쇄도할지라도 〈 집으로 가지 마시오. 〉 라는 그 문구를 막을 수는  없었다.\\n\\u3000내가 무슨 생각을 하든지 그  문구는 녹아들었다. 마치 신체상의 고통이 늘 그러하듯이  말이다.\\n\\u3000얼마 전에 나는 신문지상에서 어느 이름 모를 신사 한 명이  밤에 ‘후머스 호텔’(안 좋은 지역이었는데 이 소설이 쓰일 당시에는 호텔이 생겼음. 구글 검색 참조)로  와 하룻밤을  묵었다가 스스로 목숨을 끊어  그 다음 날 아침에 피가 낭자한 가운데 발견되었다는 어느 신문기사를 읽었었다.\\n\\u3000갑자기 내 머릿속에서 ‘그 신사가 혹시 내가 누워 있는 이 지하 납 골당(방)에서 묵었었던 것이 아닌가?’하는 생각이 떠올랐다.\\n\\u3000나는 잠자리에서 일어나 침대 주위에 핏자국의 흔적들이 있는지를 확인했다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 문을 열고는 호텔 통로들을 바라보고는 가까이에 있는 희미한 불빛을 확인하고서야 마음을 놓았다. 내가 알기로 그 불빛 가까 이에서 호텔 직원이 졸고 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이러는 동안에도, 내가 왜 집으로 가면 안 되는지, 내 숙소에 무슨 문제가 생겼기에 내가 집에 가면 안 되는지, 그럼 내가  언제 집으로 가면 되는지, 그리고 프로비스(57세, 오스트레일리아에서 탈출해 영국으로 밀입국한 죄수)는 과연 자신의 하숙집에서 안전하게 머물고 있는지 하는 질문들로 내 머릿속은 가득해서 내 머릿속에 어떤 다른 주제가 비집고 들어올 여지는 전혀 없어 보였다.\\n\\u3000심지어 내가 에스텔라를 떠올릴 때조차도, 그리고 우리가  그 날 어떻게 영원히 헤어졌었는지에 대해 떠올렸을 때조차도, 그리고 우리 헤어짐의 모든 상황들을 떠올렸을 때조차도, 그리고 그녀가 뜨개질을 하는 동안 보였던 그녀의 모든 표정들과 어조(말투)들 그리고 손가락들의 움직임을 내가 다시 떠올릴 때조차도… 그럴 때조차도 나는 생각에 생각을 거듭하고 있었고 내 주변 여기 저기 모든 곳에 그 경고문이 붙어 있는 듯  했다.\\n〈집으로 가지 마시오.〉라는.\\n\\u3000결국 내가 완전히 마음과 몸이 기진맥진한 상태에서 겉잠이 들었을 (꾸벅꾸벅 졸았을) 때 그 경고 문구는 내가 동사활용 변화를 꼭 시켜야만 하는 거대한 그림자 같은 단어가 되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000그 경고 문구는 곧 다음과 같은 현재형 시제 명령법이 되었다. “그대는 집으로 가면 안 된다.” “그를 집으로 들어서는 안 된다.” “우리를 집에 들어서는 안 된다.” “너희 또는 그대는 집으로 가선 안 된다.” “그들을 집으로 들어서는 안  된다.”\\n\\u3000그런 다음 그 경고 문구는 가정법으로 변했다. “나는 집에 가면 안돼 아니 가선 안 돼.” “나는 집에 가면 안 될지도 몰라, 아니 갈 수 없을 지도 몰라, 아니 못 갈 지도 몰라, 아니 가선 안 될 지도  몰라.”(←  젠장 -_-;; 옮기면서도 가정법 문장들 사이에 뭔 차이가 있는지 하나도 모르겠음)\\n\\u3000이런 변화는 내가 이러다 미치는 거 아냐 하고 생각할 때까지 이어졌다. 그래서 나는 배게 위에서 머리를 이러 저리 뒹굴었다. 그러곤 사   방벽 위에서 나를 응시하고 있는 원(깡통 구멍들을 통해 벽에 비친 수많은 양초 불빛들)들을 다시 쳐다보며 바로 누웠다.\\n\\u3000내가 꼭 아침 7시까진 일어나야 한다는 말을 호텔 직원에게 남겼었다. 왜냐하면 어떻게 해서든 날이 밝는 대로 내가 웨믹의 집으로 가야만 된다는 사실이 너무도 분명했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000동시에 이 일은 ‘월워스’(런던 도심지역. 런던 한 복판임, 웨믹의 집 임)에서만 할 수 있는 그의 조언이 필요한 사안임에도 너무도 분명했다.\\n\\u3000너무도 비참한 밤을 보냈던 지라 방에서 나가는 것은 어떤 위안이었다. 그래서 내 불편한 침대에서 나를 깜짝 놀라게 해 깨우기에는 호텔 직원이 문을 두 번까지도 두드릴 필요가 없었다.\\n\\u3000웨믹의 성(집=목재로 만든 작은 오두막)과 흉벽(담)들이 내 시야에 들어오기 시작한 것이 그러니까 아침 8시 무렵이었다.\\n\\u3000예전에 본 그 어린 여자애(가사도우미)가 갓 구운 롤빵(버터 발라 먹는 빵)  두 개를 들고서 성체(집)로 들어서고 있었기 때문에, 나도 그 애와 함께 뒷문을 통과해 도개교(끈으로 들어 올릴 수 있는 다리. 소설 속에선 두꺼운 판자 한 짝임. 즉 폭이 대략 1.2미터 깊이가 대략 0.6 미터쯤 되어 보이는 땅 속 ‘틈’을 가로지르며 놓여 있는 웨믹의 집으로 가는 소형다리)를 건너 내가 들어간다고 전혀  알리지도  않고 자신이 마실 차와 연로하신 아버님이 마실 차를 따르고 있는 웨믹 바로 앞에 모습을 드러냈다.\\n\\u3000열린 문을 통해 그의 연로하신 아버님이 아직 침대에 누워 계신 모습이 원근감이 느껴지는 그림처럼 보였다.\\n\\u3000“어어,\\t핍\\t씨\\t아니십니까!”\\t웨믹(변호사사무실의\\t서기)이\\t말했다. “그렇다면 시골에서 상경하신  거군요?”\\n“예,” 내가 대답했다. “하지만 숙소엔 들르지 않았습니다.”\\n\\u3000“잘 하셨습니다.” 그가 손을 닦으며 말했다. “제가 템플(주인공의 숙소)로 들어가는 모든 문에다 메시지를 남겨놓았었거든요. 당신이 읽지 않을까 하는 기대를 하면서요. 그래 어느  문을  통해  들어가신  겁니  까?”\\n내가 그의 물음에 어느 쪽 문을  통해  들어갔노라고  답해주었다. (주인공의  대사가  아니라  “웨믹”의 대사임→) “다른 쪽  문들에  남긴\\n메모들은 제가 오늘 중으로 돌아다니면서 폐기하겠습니다.”라며 웨믹이 말했다. “가능하다면 서류상의 증거들은 남겨두지 않는 것이 제 원 칙이거든요. 그것이 법정에서 증거로 제출될지 모를 일일 테니까요. 자 제가 좀 스스럼없이 대해도 되겠죠? 제 연로하신 아버지를 위해 이 소 시지(음식)를  좀 구워주시겠습니까?”\\n나는 “기꺼이 구워드리겠다.”고 말했다. \\n\\u3000“그럼 메리 앤(어린 여자애, 가사도우미 / 이름 몰라도 됨 다시 안 나오는 이름임)아, 넌 이제 네 일을 봐도 좋단다.”라며 웨믹이 어린 가사도우미에게 말했다. “이렇게 해서 우리 둘만 남게 되는 거죠, 안 그 렇습니까? 핍 씨.”라며 웨믹이 윙크를  한 방 날렸다. 그렇게 해서 그  어린  여자애는 사라졌다.\\n\\u3000나는 그의 우정과 신중함에 대해 감사의 말을 전했다. 그리고 낮은 목소리로 우리의 대화를  이어갔다.\\n\\u3000그러는 동안에도 나는 그의 연로하신 아버님을 위해 소시지(음식)를 굽고 있었고 웨믹은 자기 아버지 몫의 롤빵(버터 발라 먹는 빵) 속에 버터를  바르고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“자, 핍 씨(23세, 주인공의 이름), 잘 아시겠지만,” 웨믹이 말했다. “당신과 저는 서로를 잘 이해하고 있습니다. 우리의 관계는 사적이고도 개인적이니까요. 얼마 전까지만 해도 우린 비밀스런 거래(몰래 주인공의 친구인 허버트의 사업에 돈을 투자한 것)에 다함께 관여한 적도 있습니다. 공식적인 감상(변호사사무실에서의 만남)은 그와는 별개죠. 우린 지금 직무외의 관계에 있는 것입니다.”\\n나는 진심으로 공감을  표했다.\\n\\u3000나는 극도로 초조해하고 있었기 때문에 내가 굽고 있던 소시지(음식)가 횃불처럼 활활 타고  있는  줄도 몰랐다.  그래서 황급히 소시지에  붙은  불을 꺼야했다.\\n\\u3000“저도 우연히 들었습니다, 어제 아침(웨믹이 뉴게이트 감옥에 들러 업무를 보는 시간임)에 말이죠.” 웨믹(45세, 변호사사무실 서기)이 말했다. “제가 당신을 언젠가 한 번 데려갔었던 어떤 장소(런던 내에 있던 ‘뉴게이트 감옥’을 말함. 뉴게이트 감옥은 1902년에 폐쇄되었음)에 갔었죠…. 그 장소의 이름은 심지어 당신과 나 사이의 대화라도 대도록 언급 안 하는 것이 좋을 테죠….”\\n“좋을 리가 없죠,”라며 내가 말했다. “저도 이해합니다.”\\n\\u3000“어제 아침에 그곳에서 우연히 들었습니다,” 웨믹이 다시 말했다. “전체적으로 보아 식민지 주민의 일들과 무관하지 않고 휴대할 수 있는 재산을 소유하지 않았다고도 말할 수 없는…, 그것이 정말 누구인지 저는 모르거니와… 우리가 이 인물에게 이름을 지어줄 필요는 없으 니까요(←웨믹의 말하는 스타일이  이름).”\\n“굳이 그럴 필요는 없죠.”라며 내가 말했다. \\n\\u3000“그러니까, …이 상당히 많은 사람들이 가는 이승(현실세계)의 어떤 장소(술집-_-; 술집엔 언제나  사람이 많죠)에서 약간의 소동을 피웠다는 것입니다. 그 장소는 사람들이 자기  자신의  기분들을  만족시키기 위해 항상 들르는 곳이 아니라 그러니까 정부에서 비용을 대준다고 완 전히 아니 말할 수도 없는 그런 장소였다더군요….”\\n\\u3000그의 얼굴을 쳐다보다 그만 그의 연로하신 아버님이 드실 소시지를 봉화(불 피우는 신호)로 만들고 말았는데 이것이 내 자신과 웨믹의 마음의 평정을 크게 잃게  만들었다.\\n내가 소시지 태운 것에 대해 사과했다.\\n\\u3000“그러니까, …이 그 장소에서 사라져서 그 소동에 대해 그 부근에서는 더 이상 아무런 소문을 들을 수 없음으로 인해서,” 웨믹이 말했다. “갖가지 억측들이 솟아나고 소문들이 붙었다고 하더군요.  나는  또한 이런 얘기도 들었습니다. 당신이 ‘가든 코드’(상점가란 뜻 / 주인공의 숙소는 템스 강가에 있는 ‘가든 코트’ 내에 있음)에 있는 당신 숙소에  머물 때에도 당신이 감시를 받았었고 그 감시가 다시 재개될 가능성도 있다고 하더군요.”\\n“예? 저를 왜요?” 내가  말했다.\\n\\u3000“그것까지 설명할 순 없습니다.” 웨믹이  대답을  회피하며  말했다.  “제 공싲적인(변호사서기 업무) 책무들과 충돌할 수 있는 사안이거든요. 저는 거기 들를 때마다 같은 장소에게 여러 다른 흥미로운 사안들에 대해 종종 소문을 들어왔듯이 이번 사안도 그렇게 전해들은 것입니다. 저는 이것을 정보로써 당신께 말씀드리는 것이 아닙니다. 단지 저도 전해 들었을  뿐입니다.”\\n\\u3000얘기하는 동안 웨믹(45세, 변호사사무실 서기)이 내게서 ‘기다란 포 크’(음식 구울 때 쓰는 도구)와 소시시를 가져가더니 연로하신 아버님이 드실 수 있도록 작은 접시 위에 맵시 좋게(보기 좋게) 놓아드렸다.\\n\\u3000그러기 전에 웨믹은 깨끗하고 하얀 천을 가지고 연로하신 아버님이  계신 방으로 들어가 아버님의 턱 아래에 천을 깔끔하게 달아드렸더랬다. 웨믹이 자신의 아버지를 부축해 일으켜 들였다. 그런 다음 잠잘 때 쓰는 모자를 한쪽으로 따로 씌어 아버지를 멋쟁이로 만들어드렸다.\\n그런 다음 웨믹은 매우 주의해서 아버지 앞에 아침상을 차려드렸다. 웨믹이  아버지에게 말했다.\\n“괜찮으시죠, 연세 살짝 많으신 압(아버지)~♥?”\\n이에 기분이 좋아진, 그의 연로하신 아버지가 대답했다. “그러마. 존(웨믹의 ‘애칭=별명’), 얘야  그러마!”\\n\\u3000여기엔 그의 아버님이 남 앞에 내놓을 만한 상태에 있지 않다는 그러므로 지금은 아버님이 보이지 않는 것처럼 행동하는 것이 좋겠다는 무언의 암시가 있는  듯싶었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그들의 행동을 전혀 인지하지 못하는 척 그 옆에서 쥐죽은 듯 있었다.\\n\\u3000“제 숙소들에서의 저에 대한 이번 감시는, 물론 제가 의심받을 일이 한번 정도는 있었지만요.” 웨믹이 돌아왔을 때 내가 물었다. “웨믹 씨가 언급한 그 사람의 일과 저에 대한 제 숙소들에서의 감시가 별개의 사안인지요?”\\n웨믹은 매우 심각해  보였다.\\n\\u3000웨믹이 말했다.  “단언해드릴 수는 없습니다, 제 감도 일부 작용해 내린 결론이었거든요. 말씀드릴 수 있는 것은, 처음에는 아니었던 것 같다는 것입니다. 하지만 그렇거나, 또는 그래 질거나, 또는 그럴 위험성이  다분하다는 것입니다.”\\n\\u3000직업상 취득한 비밀에 대한 준수의무사항 때문에 그가 말을 자제하고 있다는 사실을 내가 알았기 때문에, 그리고 그가 이만큼이라도 말해 준 것이 그의 인생행로에서 얼마나 많이 벗어나 있는지 그래서 내가 그에게 감사하게 생각하고 있다는 것을 내가 잘 알았기 때문에, 나는 이 이상 캐물을 수는 없었다.\\n벽난로 너머로  잠시  생각에  잠겨있던  내가  그에게  말했다. “대답하셔도 되고 안 하셔도 된다는 조건을 달고서 제가 질문 하나\\n만 더 던져도 될까요? 옳다고  생각되시는  대로 말씀하시면 됩니다. 리틀 브리튼(변호사사무실)에 대한 웨믹 씨의 의무감과도 전혀 충돌하지 않을 거거든요.”\\n\\u3000그가 식사를 하다말고 멈췄다. 그가 팔짱을 꼈다. 그러더니 자신의 와이셔츠 소매를 엄지와 집게손가락으로 꼭 집었다. 그에게 있어서 실내에서의 편안함이란 곧 어떤 상의도 걸치지 않고 앉는 것이었다.\\n\\u3000웨믹이  고개를 한  번 끄떡여보였다. 그건 내가 질문을 던져도  된다는 승낙이었다.\\n\\u3000(주인공의 대사→) “실제 이름이 콤피슨(사기꾼)이라고 불리는 어떤 평판 나쁜 인물에 대한 소문을 들으신 적이 있으세요?”\\n\\u3000그가 다시 한 번 고개를 끄떡이며 그의 소문을 들은 적이 있음을 인정했다.\\n(주인공의 대사→) “그가 아직 살아 있습니까?” 그가 다시  한  번  고개를  끄떡여보였다. (주인공의 대사→) “그럼 그가 런던에 있나요?”\\n\\u3000그가 다시 한 번 고개를 끄떡여 보이더니 우체통(웨믹의 입은 우체통을 닮았음)을 완전히 잠가버렸다. 그런 후 나를 향해 다시 한 번 고개를 끄떡여보이곤 자신의 아침식사를  계속했다.\\n“이제,”라며 웨믹이 말했다. “질문은  끝났습니다.”\\n\\u3000그는 내가 알아듣기 쉽도록 강조해서 다시 한 번 말했다. “그럼 제가 그 소문을 듣고 나서 했던 일들에 대해 들어가겠습니다. 전 ‘가든 코트’(상점가란 뜻 / 주인공의 숙소는 템스  강가에  있는  ‘가든 코트’ 내에 있음)로 가서 당신을 찾았습니다. 하지만 안 계시더군요. 그래서 ‘클래리커(사람이름 / 주인공이  몰래  돈을  투자해  허버트를 고용하게 한 회사이름이자 대표이름) 회사’로 가서 허버트 씨(23세, 주인공의 절 친)를 찾았습니다.”\\n“그래서 그를 찾았나요?” 내가 크게 걱정하며 말했다. \\n\\u3000“거기서 그를 만났습니다. 어떤 실명(이름)도 언급하지 않은 채 그리고 어떤 내용도 발설하지 않은 채 저는 허버트 씨에게 이해시켰습니다. 당신(주인공) 숙소들 주변이나 인접한 이웃 주변에 있는 톰(사람이 름)이든, 잭(이름)이든, 또는 리처드(이름)이든지 어떤 누군가를 알고 있다면, 당신(주인공)이 안 계시는 동안 허버트 씨가 그 톰(이름)이든, 잭(이름)이든, 또는 리처드(이름)이든을 인가에서 멀리 떨어진 외딴 곳으로 옮겨드리는 것이  좋겠다고요.”\\n\\u3000“허버트가 완전히 멘붕이였겠네요?(허버트는 무엇을 해야 할지 아주 혼란스러워했겠군요?)”\\n\\u3000“그래도 역시 제(웨믹)가 허버트 씨(주인공의 절친)에게 그 톰(이름)인지, 잭(이름)인지, 또는 리처드(이름)인지 하는 사람을 지금 당장은  너무 멀리 옮기려는 시도는 안전하지 않다는 제 의견을 제시했기 때문에 허버트 씨가 더 당황한 것 같았습니다. 핍(23세, 주인공 이름) 씨, 당신께 중요한 얘기를 해야겠습니다. 지금과 같은 상황에서는, 일단 잠 입에 성공했다면 대도시처럼 좋은 은신처도 없습니다. 은신처를 너무 빨리 벗어나지는 마십시오. 숨어 계십시오. 일단은 상황이 느슨해질 때 까지 기다리십시오. 그리곤 기회를 엿보세요. 이건 외국 밀항을 도모할 때조차도 마찬가지입니다.”\\n그런 귀중한 조언을 해준 것에 대해 나는 그에게 감사를 표했다. 그에게 물었다.\\n“그래서 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)는 어떻게 했나요?” \\n\\u3000“허버트 씨(23세, 주인공의 절친)는,”라며 웨믹(45세, 변호사사무실 서기. 선량함)이 말했다. “30분 동안 망연자실해져 계시더니 결국 한  가지 계획을 도출해냈습니다. 그가 제게 은밀히 다음과 같이 말하더군요. ‘제 약혼자에게 도움을 청하겠습니다. 그녀에겐 몸져누워 계시는 아빠가 한 분 계신데, 물론 이 사실은 핍(주인공이름)도 압니다. 한때 선박의 사무장(사무책임자, 선원)이셨던 그녀의 아빠는 활 모양으로 내  민 창가 침대에 누워 템스 강 상류와 하류로 지나가는 배들을 지켜보며 하루를 보내고 계십니다.’라더군요. 아마 당신(주인공)이 그녀와도 안면을 텄다면서요?”\\n\\u3000“그렇지는 않습니다.”라며 내가 말했다.

공기가 맑은 장소였다. 이곳은 강에서  불어온 바람이 빙글 회전할 수  있는  공간이  있는 장소였다. 그리고 두 그루 또는 세 그루 정도의 나무들도 있는 장 소였다. 주요 부분이 잘려나가 버려진 풍차의 흔적이 있는 장소였다.\\n그곳에 ‘푸른  빛깔  구리를  입힌  우리  밧줄  공장’이  있었다. 노쇠해(나이 들어) 대부분의 치아(갈퀴)를 잃고 퇴직한 ‘건초 제조용\\n갈퀴들’처럼 보이는 일련(연속)의 목재 프레임(난간)들을 따라, 나는 달빛 아래서 그 공장으로 가는 길고 좁은 가로수 길을 따라갈 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000‘제분소(방앗간)가 있는 저수지(인공 못) 제방(둑)’에는 기묘하게(이 상하게) 생긴 주택들이 몇 있었다. 그 증에 건물정면이 목재로 되어 있고 3층에 활 모양으로 내민창이 있는 어느 주택을 골라 현관문에 달린 문패(집주인 이름)를 읽어보았다. 거기엔 〈 윔플 부인 댁 〉 (←이름 몰라도 됩니다. 몇 번 더 나오지만 전혀 중요하지 않은 소설 속 엑스트 라임)이라고  적혀 있었다.\\n\\u3000그 활 모양으로 내민창은 돌출된 창은 아니었다. 설명하긴 뭐하지만 어쨌든 다른 종류의  창이었다.\\n\\u3000〈 윔플 부인 〉 이란 명패는 내가 찾던 이름이었기 때문에 나는 문을 두드렸다. 곧 40세 정도 되어 보이는 부인이 응답했다. 상냥하고 넉넉해  보이는 부인이었다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 즉시 물러나고 대신 허버트가 조용히 나를 응접실로 안내하곤  문을 닫았다.\\n\\u3000약간 색다른 느낌이었다. 친숙한 얼굴을 한 그(23세, 허버트)가 아주 낮선 방과 동네에서 완전히 집에 앉아 있는 것처럼 편히 자리 잡고 있는 것을 보고 있자니 약간 색다른 느낌이 들었다.\\n\\u3000내가 유리잔과 중국식 도자기로 장식되어 있는 식기 선반(삼각형 모양)을 유심히 쳐다 본만큼이나 나는 허버트의 얼굴 또한 유심히 살펴  보고 있는 내 자신을 느꼈다.\\n\\u3000벽난로 위 선반에는 조가비(조개껍데기) 모양의 용기들이 놓여 있었으며, 벽에는 ‘쿡 선장’(다 아시겠지만... 쿡 선장은 평민에서 영국해군 대령까지 오른 인물, 세계일주3번, 1779년 하와이 원주민에게 살해됨. 말이 좋아 쿡 선장이지 발견된 원주민 사회는 거의 괴멸되다시피 했죠.  다  지나간  얘기지만)의  죽음을  그리고  있는  채색된 판화(그림)와 배의 진수식(배를 물에 띄움)을 묘사하고 있는 판화와 쿡 선장의 군주인

만족해하고 있고 물론 널 끔찍이 보고 싶어 하지만 말이야. 내 피앙세(약혼녀)는 아버지와 함께 있어. 클라라(22세, 허버트의 피앙세)가 내려올 때까지 기다려줄래 오늘은 꼭 너를 그녀에게 소개시켜주고 싶거든. 서로 인사를 나눈 다음 위층으로 올라가보자. 저 소린(아파서 내는 비명소리) 그녀의  아버지야.”\\n\\u3000그때쯤에는 나도 위층에서부터 들려오는 일종의 경각심을 울리는 것 같은 으르렁거리는 소리를 인지하고 있었다. 내 표정에 그 사실이 나타나 있었나보다. 허버트가 그런 말을 한 것을 보면.\\n\\u3000“그녀의 아버지가 처치 곤란한 늙은 악당이라는 게 아쉬워.”라며 허버트가 사뭇 미소를 머금으며 말했다. “하지만 나도 아직 그를 본 적은 없어. 럼주(사탕수수에 물을 타서 발효시켜 만든 술) 냄새가 나는 것 같지 않니? 그는 술을 항상 달고 사신단다.”\\n“럼주를?”라며  내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그래.” 허버트가 대꾸했다. “술이 그의 통풍(뼈마디가 부어 아픈  병)을 얼마나 부드럽게 해줄지 한 번 헤아려 봐. 또한 그는 모든 식량을 위층에 있는 자기 방에 보관한 채 그걸 배급해준단다. 자기 머리맡의 선반들 안에 식량들을 감춰두고서 일일이  무게를  재워보지.  그의 방은 일종의 잡화상(아주 작은 슈퍼마켓)의 가게 같을 게 분명해.”\\n\\u3000허버트가 그러한 얘기들을 널려놓는 동안, 그 으르렁거리는 소리는 점점 더 길게 발음되는 일종의 울림으로 바뀌어갔고 ‘어느 순간 사라 졌다’(직역→그러고는  서서히 잦아들었다).\\n\\u3000“그 외에 어떤 결과가 발생할 수 있었겠니?”라며 허버트가 설명조로 말했다. “자기가 치즈를 자르겠다는데. 오른 손에 통풍(뼈마디가 부어서 아픈  병)이 있는 사람이  또한  몸 다른 구석구석도 아픈 사람이  손을 베이지 않고서 ‘더블 글로스터’(주황색의 단단한 영국 치즈. 소의 젖으로만\\t만든\\t치즈.\\t사진링크\\t:

때문이다.\\n\\u3000“프로비스(57세, 죄수)를 저층의 위층에 머물 하숙인으로 받은 것은 ‘윔플 부인’(하숙집 주인, 과부, 독자가 이름 알 필요 없음)에겐 하늘이  준 뜻하지 않은 은총이었을 거야.”라며 허버트가 말했다. “왜냐하면 정상적인 사람이라면 저 소음을 견딜 리가 없기 때문이지. 여긴 별난 곳이지 않니 헨델(23세, 주인공의  이름)?”\\n\\u3000그랬다. 참 별난 곳이었다. 기이하면서도 호기심이 가는 그러면서도 눈에 띌 정도로 주부의 손길이 가 있는 잘 정돈되어 있는 깨끗한 집이 었다.\\n\\u3000내가 그 말(집이 참 깨끗하다)에 동의하자 허버트가 다음과 같이 말 했다.\\n\\u3000“윔플 부인(이름 몰라도 됨)은 최고의 가정주부들 중 한 분이셔. 어머니 같은 그런 분의 도움이 없었다면 클라라(22세, 허버트의 약혼녀) 가 어떻게 지낼지 정말 상상도 안 돼. 클라라(약혼녀)는 어머님이 안 계셔, 헨델(주인공의 애칭), 친척들도 없단다. ‘험상궂은 퉁퉁 이’(퉁명스럽고 험상궂은 사람) 한 분만 제외하곤 말이야. 그게 그녀의 아버지지.”\\n“물론 ‘험상궂은 퉁퉁 이’가 그의 실명(이름)은 아닐 테지, 허버트?” \\n“아냐, 아니고말고.”라며 허버트가 말했다. “클라라 아버님의 성함은\\n‘발리’ 씨야.(발리=‘보리’라는 뜻임. 보리쌀 할 때의 보리) 하지만 내 아빠와 엄마를 생각했을 때(두 분 모두 씀씀이가 너무 헤픔. 과소비) 이런 내가 그녀를 사랑할 수 있다는 것이 얼마나 축복인지 몰라. 그녀  에겐 내 아빠와 엄마 같은 친척들이 없지 않겠니? 가족들 때문에 그녀 자신이나 다른 누군가를 성가시게 할 일이 없을 테니까 말이야.”\\n\\u3000허버트는 이전에도 내게 말해주었듯이 이번에도 내게 자신이 클라라(이름) 발리(성 씨) 양을 어떻게 해서 알게 되었는지 일려주었다.\\n\\u3000해머스미스(런던서쪽 템스 강 옆. 즉  허버트의 하숙집  말고 부모님 집 근처)의 어느 교육기관에서 그녀 자신의 교육을 마무리 짓고 있을 때  만났다고 했다.\\n\\u3000특히 클라라가 아버지의 간호를 위해 집으로  소환되게  되었을  때, 그와 그녀는 어머니 같은 윔플 부인(클라라가 살고 있는 집 주인)에게 자신들의 사랑을 고백했던  것이다.\\n\\u3000그때 이후로 그들의 사랑은 윔플 부인에 의해 촉진되었고 그녀의 한결같은 친절과 분별로 보듬어져왔다고 했다.\\n\\u3000그 세 사람 사이에는 사랑에 관한 어떤 것이든 클라라의 아버지에게 털어놓을 수 없다는 동의가 있었는데, 이는 통풍(뼈마디가 부어 아픔)과 럼주(술)와 식량 짱박아둠(-_- 여하튼 내가 해석했지만 단어선택하곤) 이상의 어떤 심리적인 주제도 받아들일 수 없을 정도로 그(클라라의 아버지. 한 때 선박의 사무장이었다가 술로 인생을 버린 사람. 실제 소설 속에 등장하는 일은 없음. 주로 목소리로만 이 소설에 등장함)가 이미 피폐해져 있었기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000우리가 그와 같은 이야기를 낮은 목소리로 나누는 동안 ‘발리’(클라 라의 아버지) 씨가 지속적으로 내고 있는 고함소리가 천정을 가로질러 놓여있던 보(바닥 하중(무게)을 기둥으로 전달해주는 구조물. 작은 대 들보. -_-; 칵~ 설명 너무 멋지다~자화자찬~)를 타고 전해지는 동안, 문이 열리고 어느 아리땁고 가냘픈 몸매를 한 짙은 눈썹의 소녀, 20세 가량 되었을 소녀 한 명이 팔에 바구니를 건 채 들어왔다.\\n\\u3000그녀의 품에 있던 바구니를 허버트가 부드럽게 받아준 후 녀석이 무척 수줍어하며 “얘가 클라라야.”라고 그녀를 내게 소개시켜주었다.\\n\\u3000그녀는 정말이지 내가 이제까지 본 아가씨들 중 가장 매력적이고 호감이 가는 아가씨였다. 어쩌면 그녀는 늙은 발리(클라라의 아버지) 씨라는 호전적이고 무서운 괴물에게 봉사하도록 몰아붙여지고 있는 사로 잡힌  요정이었는지 모른다.\\n\\u3000우리가 좀 더 대화를 나누고 나서 “이거 좀 봐봐,”라며 허버트가 내게 그녀가 가지고 온 바구니를 보이며 말했다. 그가 상황을 알만하다는 듯 한(클라라의 아버지가 오늘 저녁에  먹을 식량과 내일 아침에 먹을 식량을 딸에게 아주 조금만 주었다는 얘기) 동정심 많은 미소를 지었다.\\n\\u3000“이게 이 가여운 아가씨의 저녁식사야. 이렇게 매일 밤 배급을 받는 단다. 여기 이건 그녀 몫의 빵이고 이건 그녀의 치즈, 그리고 이게 그녀가 받은 럼주야. 물론 이건 내가 먹게 되겠지만. 이쪽에 있는 건 그  녀가 준비해야하는 발리 씨(클라라의 아버지)의 내일 아침 식사야. 내일 드실 음식도 전날 밤에 이렇게 배급받지. 양의 갈비 고기 살 두 점, 감자 3개랑 꼬투리를 벗긴 완두콩 약간이랑, 약간의 밀가루와 50그램 (g)의 버터랑 소금 한 스푼 그리고 이건 모두 껍질 채 빻은 검은 후추 가루들. 모두 함께 넣고 끊여서 매콤하게 우려내면 이거야 말로 통풍 (뼈마디가 부어 아픈 병)에 좋다나봐!”\\n\\u3000바구니에 든 음식재료들을 허버트가 상세히 언급하는 동안 클라라 (20세, 허버트의 약혼녀)가 보인, 모든 불만을 묵묵히 받아들이는 듯한 (순종하는=단념하는 듯한) 표정에는 확실히 사람의 마음을 끄는 꾸밈 없는  무엇인가가 있었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 허버트가 껴안는 팔에 안길 때 그녀가 보인 정숙한 태도에는 순진하고 애정 깊은 무언가 순결한 구석이 있었다.\\n\\u3000중국인들이 사는 강 유역과 ‘푸른 빛깔 구리를 입힌 우리(나 너 우리 할 때 ’우리‘) 밧줄 공장’ 옆의 ‘제분소(방앗간)가 있는 저수지(인공못) 제방(둑)’에 자리 잡고 있는 집에서 보(바닥 아래에 있는 작은 대들보) 를 통해 전해지는 발리 영감(술로 인생을 버린, 클라라의 아버지)의 불만에 찬 소리들과 함께 지내기에는 그녀는 너무도 조용하고 너무도 보호받아야 할 필요성이 있는 무엇인가를 간직하고 있는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그 느낌이 너무도 강렬했기 때문에 내가 아직 확인해보지 않은, 매 그위치(57세, 주인공에게 막대한 유산상속을 약속한 죄수)의  핸드백  속에 든 돈을 몽땅 다 지불한다손 치더라도 절대 그녀(클라라)와 허버트(약혼자) 사이의 약혼이 깨지는 것을 보고 싶진 않았다.\\n\\u3000내가 즐거이 감탄해 마지않으며 그녀를 바라보고 있을 때였다. 갑자기 위층에서 그 울부짖는 고함소리가 다시 들어오기 시작했다. 이번엔 무언가가 맞부딪치는 무서운 소리였다(클라라의 아버지가  나무막대기로 바닥을 치는 소리). 마치 나무다리를 가진 거인이 그와 우리 사이에 놓인 천장을 뚫고 우릴 덮치려는 것만 같았다.\\n\\u3000이 즉시 클라라가 허버트에게 말했다. “자기(달링), 아빠가 절 부르려는가 봐요!” 그러더니 도망치듯 사라졌다.\\n\\u3000“저렇게나 비양심적으로 탐욕스러운 세관원(세금징수원)도 없을 거 야!”라며 허버트가 말했다. “그가 지금 뭘 생각하는지 맞춰볼까, 헨델 (주인공이름)?)\\n\\u3000“나는 모르지,”라며 내가 말했다. “술 마실 것을 달라는 거 아닐까?” “바로 그거야!” 내가 마치 엄청난 수학공식을 풀었다는 듯이 허버트가 소리쳤다. “그는 식탁 위에 있는  작은  통에  물을  탄 독한 럼주를 미리 보관하고 있어. 잠시 기다려봐, 무슨 소리가 들릴 걸, 그건 클라 라(20세,  허버트의  약혼녀)가  그를  일으켜세워  약간의  럼주를 마시게\\n하는 소리야. 바로 저 소리지!”\\n\\u3000또 다른 고함소리가 들렸다. 끝 부분을 오래 끌며 흔들리는 외침이었다. 뒤이어 침묵이 흐르자 허버트가 말했다. “이건 그가 술을 마시고 있기  때문이야, 자.”\\n\\u3000뒤이어 보(바닥 아래 수평구조물)를 타고 한 차례 더 고함소리가 들러오자 허버트는 이렇게 말했다. “이제 그 양반 도로 나가 떨어졌군!”\\n\\u3000머지않아 클라라(20세, 허버트의 약혼녀)가 돌아오자, 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)가 나를 대동하고 위층으로 올라갔다. 우리가 책임져야할 사람(57세, 죄수=(가명)프로비스=(실명)매그위치)을 보기  위해서였다.\\n\\u3000우린 발리 씨(클라라의 아버지. 술로 인생을 망친 한 때 선박의 사무 장이었던 남성. 소설 속 엑스트라)의 방문  앞을  지나가야했다. 내부에서 목이 쉬도록 중얼거리고 있는 소리가 들려왔다. 바람처럼 올라갔다 바람처럼 내려가는 그 중얼거림의 선율은 다음과 같은 후렴구로 이어지고 있었다. 다만 그가 사용한 단어들이 심하므로 그 단어와 정반대  되는 행복을 비는 마음으로 바꿔 불러보겠다.\\n\\u3000(클라라 아버지(예전에는 선박의 사무장이었음)가 술 마시고 부른 노 래=욕설→) “어어이, 이봐 그 배! 네 놈들의 눈동자에 축복 깃들라, 이 배엔 영감탱이 빌 발리(클라라 아버지의 이름)가 타고 있다. 여기 영감 탱이 빌 발리가 타고 있다고. 네 놈들의 눈동자에 축복 깃들라. 여기 영감탱이 빌 발리가 기어이 바닥에 벌렁  드러누워  자빠져있으니까. 늙어 죽은

스스로와 교감하며 모습을 드러내지 않고 있어. 날이 밝은 때에는 종종 강을 멀리 내다볼 목적으로 자신의  침대  위에다가  설치해놓은  확대  망원경에다 한 쪽 눈을 대고  지낸대.”\\n\\u3000주택 꼭대기 층에는 배의 선실 같은 방이 두 개 있었다. 공기가 맑고 바람이 잘 통하는  방이었다.\\n\\u3000그 방에서는 2층에 있는 발리 씨가 고함치는 소리가 1층보다 적게 들렸다.\\n\\u3000그곳에 프리비스(57세, 죄수=주인공에게 막대한  유산을  주려는  사 람. 하지만 지금 당장은 쫒기는 사람)가 아주 편안하게 자리 잡고 앉아 있었다.\\n\\u3000그는 나를 보고도  어떤 놀람도 표시하지 않았다. 지금 자신의  상황에 대해 언급할 가치가 있는 것은 아무것도 느끼지 못하는 것처럼 보였다. 하지만 정의하긴 힘들지만 나는 그가 부드러워져 있다는 인상을 받았다.(원래 프로비스는 난폭한  사람임)\\n\\u3000내가 굳이 정의하기 힘들다는 표현을 쓴 것은 그가 어떻게 부드러운지 그 때도 그리고 그 이후에도 내가 결코 회상할 수 없었기 때문이다. 하지만 그는 확실히 부드러워져 있었다.\\n\\u3000그 날의 휴식이 내게 이번 사태를 좀 더 심사숙고해볼 기회를 주었다. 결과적으로 난 콤피슨(철저한 사기꾼)에 대한 얘기를 프로비스(57세, 죄수)에게 하지 않기로 완전히 마음먹었다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 내가 아는 바로는, 만약 콤피슨 얘기를 했다가는, 콤피슨에 대한 증오로 프로비스가 콤피슨을 찾아내려 할 것이며 그거야 말로 프로비스가 자신의 파멸을 향해 돌진하는 꼴이 될지 몰랐기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000벽난로 옆에 허버트와 내가 그와 함께 자리를 잡고 앉았을 때, 앞서와 같은 이유로 나는 우선 프로비스에게 다음과 같은 질문을 던졌다.\\n\\u3000“웨믹(변호사 사무실의 서기, 착함, 현재의 주인공들의 정보통)의 판단과 정보를 믿을 수 있으세요?”\\n\\u3000“그래, 그래, 얘야!”라며 그가 매우 심각하게 고개를 끄떡이며 말했다. “그건 재거스(런던 유명 변호사)도 인증하는 사실이다.”\\n\\u3000“그래서, 제가 웨믹과 좀 얘기를 나누고 왔어요.” 내가 말했다. “웨믹이 제게 어떤 주의(미행을 조심하라)를 주었는지 그리고 무슨 조언(사태가 잠잠해지면 인도로  밀항해라)을  했는지  아저씨껜 말씀드려야 할 것 같아서요.”\\n\\u3000방금 말한 조건부대로(사기꾼인 콤피슨 얘기는 빼고) 나는 프로비스 (57세, 죄수)에게 모두  말해주었다.\\n\\u3000웨믹(변호사 사무실 서기,  착함)이 그러한  소식들(미행당하고 있다) 을  뉴게이트  감옥(런던에  있던  옛날  감옥.  1902년에  폐쇄  /  이 소설\\n『 위대한 유산 』 은 1861년에 나왔음)에서 어떻게 들었는지, 그리고 프 로비스가 현재 모종의 혐의를 받고 있다는 사실과, 내 숙소가 지금까지 감시당해온 것 같다는 얘기들이며, 웨믹이 잠시 동안 당신을 숨기는 것이 좋겠다고 말한 것이며, 그리고 나도 또한 그(프로비스)에게서 잠시 떨어져 지내는 것이 좋겠다는 얘기며, 그를 해외로 출국시키는 방안에 대해 웨믹이 말한 것들을 나는 프로비스에게 정확하게 다 들려 주었다.\\n물론 나는 다음과 같은 말을 덧붙이는 것도 잊지 않았다.\\n\\u3000“때가 되면 저도 아저씨와 함께 가고 싶습니다. 만약 여의치 않으면 아저씨가 먼저 나가시고 제가 뒤이어 출국하면 됩니다. 이건 웨믹이 판단하건대 가장 안전할 것  같다더군요.”\\n그에 뒤따라야 하는 얘기를 나는 언급하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000정말이지, 그것에 대한 내 생각이 뚜렷한 것도 아니었거니와 마음도 편지 않았기 때문이다. 왜냐하면 그가 분명 더 부드러워져 있었고 나를 위해 영국으로 밀입국했다가 위험에 처한 것이 분명해 보였기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000나는 내 지출을 급격히 늘러 생활하자는 그의 며칠 전 제안에 대해서도  이의를 제기했다.\\n\\u3000“우리가 지금 처한 불안정하고 힘든 상황에서 그건 정말 터무니없는 생각이세요. 이것도 더 나빠질 게 없다면 하는 소리에요.”\\n\\u3000프로비스(57세, 죄수)는 이것을(지금 상황에서 과소비는 위험함)을 부정할 수 없었다. 정말이지 그는 이야기 내내 대단히 분별 있었기 때문이다.\\n그가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“귀국은 모험이었다. 그리고 그리 될 거라는  것도 항상 알고 있었다.  될 대로  되라 식의 모험은 더 하지 않으마. 하지만 이런 훌륭한 도움을 받는 내 안전에 대해선 전혀 염려되지 않는구나.”\\n\\u3000지금까지 벽난로 불을 바라보며 숙고(생각)에 잠겨있던 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)가 이 부분에서 끼어들며 말했다.\\n\\u3000“웨믹(45세, 변호사 사무실의 서기)의 말을 들으니 내게도 생각나는 것이 있어. 아마 이게 우리들에게 상당한 도움이 될 거 같아. 자 들어    봐. 우리 둘(주인공과 허버트) 다 상당히 노를 잘 저어. 그렇지 않니 헨델(주인공의 애칭=별명). 그러니까 적당한 시기가 오면 우리가 아저 씨를 강 하류까지 데려다드리자. 이 일에 뱃사공을 고용할 필요도 보  트를 따로 빌릴 필요도 없어. 그러지 않는 게 의심을 들 받는 방법이  니까. 어떤 혐의든 줄일 수 있는 건 줄일 가치가 있으니까. 지금이 초겨울인 것도 신경 써지마. 일단은 네(23세, 주인공)가 템플 (주인공의 숙소가 있는 곳) 선착장에 보트 하나를 매어두고서 언제나  강을 저어 오르거나 강을 저어 내려가는 거야.  내 생각 괜찮지  않니. 네가 그 습관에 익숙해지면 아무도 주의를 기울이거나 신경 쓰지 않을    거 아니니? 그렇게 넌 20번 내지는 50 차례 그 습관을 계속하는 거야. 일단 그 숫자만 채우면 사람들은 이후 네가 21번째로 보트를 타는지 51번째로 보트를 타는지 전혀 신경 쓰지 않을 거야.”\\n\\u3000나는 그 계획이 좋았다. 허버트의 제안을 듣고 프로비스(57세, 죄수. 주인공에게 막대한 유산을 상속하려다 쫒기는 신세가 된 죄수)의 기분이 한껏 돋아난 것은 두 말할 필요도 없었다.\\n\\u3000우리는 동의했다. 그것이 실행에 옮겨져야 한다고. 일단 우리가 다리 아래로 와 ‘제분소(방앗간)가 있는 저수지(인공 못) 제방(둑)’을 지나서 노를 저어갈 때 프로비스가 절대 우리를 아는 체하지 않기로 했다.\\n\\u3000그리고 한 발 더 나아가서 우리는 그가 방안에서 우리를 볼 때면 그리고 무사할 땐 언제나 동쪽 창문의 블라인드(햇빛 가리기)를 끌어내려 놓기로 동의를 보았다.(굳이 동쪽 창문의 블라인드를 내려놓기로 한 이유는, 현재 주인공들이 있는 런던 템플(숙소)에서 인도로 가는 큰 배를 타려면 런던(템스 강) 동쪽으로 보트를 몰래 타고 어느 정도 가야함)\\n\\n\\u3000(※ 참고, 동서남북 지리 잠깐 설명 : 템플은 런던 중앙이자 템스 강과 붙어있는 지역 / 남쪽이 템스 강. 북쪽이 템플임. 그 템플 안에 주인공의 집이 있음. 템플에 있는 주인공의 숙소 근처 선착장에서 보트를 타고 프로비스가 묵고 있는 하숙집까지 내려온 후 프로비스를 태우고 템스 강을 계속 동쪽(런던 왼쪽)으로 내려가면 외국으로 갈 수 있는 큰 배들이 들어오고 나가는 항구가 나옴 / 그러니까 요지는 배경이 지금(2014년)의 런던 중앙이자 ‘템스 강의 북쪽’이라는 것. 물론 이 소설이 쓰일 당시엔 템플이 런던 중앙은 아니었겠죠^^ 아닌가???)\\n\\n\\u3000우리의  의논이 이제 마무리 되고 모든 계획들이 조정되었을 때, 나는 돌아가기 위해 자리에서 일어섰다. 그러면서 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)에게 “우리가 동시에 나가지 않는 게 좋겠어. 내가 먼저 이 집을  나갈 테니까 넌 30분 쯤 있다가 나와죠.”라며 언질을 준 후 프로비스를 바라보며 “아저씨를 여기 남겨두고 가긴 싫지만, 상황이 상황이니  만큼 제 가까이 계시는 것보단 여기서 머무르시는 게 더 안전할 거예요. 안녕히 계세요!”라고  말했다.\\n\\u3000“그러마. 얘야.”라며 그(프로비스)가 내 두 손을 꼭  붙잡으며 대답했다. “우리가 언제 다시 만날지는 모른다만 난 이 자리에서 안녕히 가란 말은 못하겠구나. 얘야, ‘굿 나잇’(밤 인사)라고 말해주겠니!”\\n\\u3000“그럼 잘 주무세요! 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)가 아저씨와 저 사이에서 정기적으로 소식을 전해줄 거예요. 때가 되면(주인공이 보트를  한 50번쯤은 더 타서 사람들의 시선이 익숙해지고 템스 강의 물이 밀물에서 썰물 〈 런던에서 바다로 흘러가는 물 〉로 변하면) 저도 준비가 되어 있는 것으로 확신해도 좋으세요. 굿 나잇(밤 인사), 아저씨 잘 주무세요!”\\n\\u3000우리(주인공, 허버트, 프로비스) 생각으론 프로비스가 숙소에 머무는 것이 가장 좋겠다고  생각했다.\\n\\u3000우리는 그를 떠났다.  그는  방 문  바깥쪽 층계참(위층과 아래층  중간에 있는 여유 공간)에 서 있었다. 우리가 계단 아래로 내려갈 수 있도록 그가 계단 난간 너머로 램프 불빛을 비추어주었다.\\n\\u3000내가 그를 다시 되돌아보았을 때였다. 나는 그가 나를 처음 찾아왔었던 그 폭풍우 치는 밤을 떠올렸다. 그때 우리의 처지는 지금과 정반 대였었다. 그리고 그때는 지금과 같이 내가 그를 떼어놓고 가면서 이토록 마음이 무겁고 걱정스러울 거라곤 전혀 예상하지 못했었다.\\n\\u3000발리 영감은 여전히 으르렁거리며 뭐라 뭐라 중얼거리듯 맹세하고 있었다. 우리가 그의 방문 앞을 다시 지나갈 때 말이다. 그가 그 중얼거림을 한때 중단했다거나 아님 앞으로 중지할 조짐은 전혀 없어보였다.\\n\\u3000우리가 1층 계단 바닥에 발을 내딛었을 때, 내가 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)에게 “아저씨가 프로비스라는 이름을  계속  사용하신대?”라고 물었다.\\n\\u3000허버트가 대답하기를 “물론 아니지, 하숙인 이름 란에 미스터 ‘캠벨’ 씨라고 써났거든.”라고 말했다.  (참고로, 이  소설과 전혀 관련이  없지만 -_- 역사 이야기 하나 / 캠벨 = 이 소설 『 위대한 유산 』 이 쓰이기 3년 전<1858년>에 인도에서 세포이의 항쟁<인도용병들의 항쟁>을 진압한 영국 육군 원수<장군>의  성씨)\\n허버트의 추가 설명에  따르면,\\n\\u3000“그 ‘캠벨’  씨(프로비스의 2번째 가명)에 대해 최대한도로 알려진 것은 내(허버트. 주인공이 아니라 허버트 자신)가 캠벨 씨(프로비스)를 인도받았으며 캠벨 씨(프로비스)가 잘 보살펴지며 은둔 생활을 하시는 게 나(허버트)의 강렬한 개인적 관심사항이라는 것 정도야.”였다.\\n\\u3000그래서 우리가 윔플 부인(집주인)과 클라라(20세, 허버트의 약혼녀) 가 일을 하며 앉아 있는 응접실로 다시 들어섰을 때, 나는 캠벌 씨(프로비스)에 대한 내 관심을 전혀 표명하지 않고 숨겨두었다.\\n\\u3000내가 예쁘고 상냥하며 짙은(검은)  눈썹을  한  “소녀”(클라라,  20세)와, 진실한 사랑에 대한 가장 애틋한  감정 공유를 할 수 있었던 어머님 같은 “부인(집주인인 윔플 부인)”과 작별인사를 하고 헤어졌을 때, 나는 마치 ‘푸른 빛깔 구리를 입힌 우리(우리 함께 할 때의 ‘우리’) 밧줄 공장’이 완전히 새로운 장소로 탈바꿈한 것 같은 느낌이 들었다.\\n\\u3000발리 영감(클라라의 아버지. 술 중독)은 고대 아시아의 역사만큼이나 나이가 많을지 몰라도(←이 문장 의역임-_-;; 멋져~), 그리고 발리 영감이 들판을 가득 메운 기병들(말)만큼이나 하느님의 이름을 들먹이며 욕설을  할지 몰라도.\\n\\u3000하지만 이곳 중국인들이 사는 강 유역에는 이곳을 가득 메우고도 남을 젊은, 신뢰, 희망을 되찾아가고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 에스텔라가 떠올랐고 어제 있었던 그녀와의 이별이 머릿 속에서 떠올랐다. 나는 몹시 슬픈 상태가 되어 집으로 귀가했다.\\n\\u3000템플(주인공의 숙소가 있는 동네 이름 / 런던 안)은 여전히 변함없이 모든 것들이 쥐죽은 듯  조용했다.\\n\\u3000최근에 프로비스(57세, 죄수=주인공에게 막대한 유산을 물려주려던 사람)가 점유하고 있었던 ‘숙소 한 쪽 편’ 방들의 창문들은 음산하고 조용한  채로 있었다.\\n\\u3000‘가든 코트’(상점가란 뜻 / 주인공의 숙소는 템스 강가에 있는 ‘가든 코트’ 내에 있음) 내에는 더 이상 어슬렁어슬렁 거리며 걷는 사람은 안 보였다.\\n\\u3000내 숙소로 가는 계단을 밟고 내려가기 전에 나는 분수대(울타리가 건물들 주변에 쳐져 있고, 그 울타리에 있는 정문<수위가 지키는 정문>으로 들어가면 다시 여러 채의 건물들<4층 또는 5층>이 분수대 주변으로 쭉 있는 아파트 같은 배치구조임 / 여기선 주인공의 숙소가 있는 건물들로 가는 길에 있는 분수대들을 말함 -_- 뭔 소리야? 저도 모름 내가 이 설명을 왜 했을까????)를 두 번인가 세 번 지나쳤다.\\n다행히도 거리엔 확실히 나 혼자 뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 내 숙소로  들어오자마자  침대로  직행했다.  나를  뒤따라 30분 쯤 후엔 허버트도 집으로 들어왔다. 내 베갯머리 쪽으로 온 허버트가 “미행은  없었어.”라며 알려주었다.\\n물론 허버트도 기운 없고 피로한 상태였다.\\n\\u3000그런 후  허버트가 창문들 중 하나를 열더니 달빛이 비취는 바깥 풍경을 바라보며 이렇게  말했다.\\n\\u3000“저거 좀 봐봐, 템플의 인도(=보도=길. 국가 ‘인도’가 아니라 사람이 밟고  다니는 ‘인도’를 말함)는 지금 시각 어떤 대성당의  인도(=보도=  길) 못지않게 사람들이 나다니지 않는 엄숙한 장소가 되어 있어.”라고.\\n\\u3000이튿날(다음날) 나는 계획 실행을 위한 보트를 구하기 시작했다. 곧 보트 하나를 살 수 있었다. 그 보트는 그 자리에서 템플(주인공의 숙소가 있는 동네이름) 선착장으로 돌려져, 내가 1분 또는 2분 이내에 탈수 있는 자리에  메어졌다.\\n\\u3000그때부터 나는 보트 노 젓는 연습과 실습을 하는 마냥 선착장으로 나가기 시작했고 때때론 나 혼자서 또는 이따금씩은 허버트와 동행하며 노 젓는 연습을 했다.\\n\\u3000추울 때도 비가 올 때도 그리고  진눈깨비(눈)가  내릴  적에도 나는 종종 보트를 타러 선착장으로 나갔다. 하지만 내가 이렇게 몇 번 굳은 날씨에도 외출한 이후로는 아무도 내 행동을 그렇게 많이 눈여겨보지  않게 되었다.\\n\\u3000처음에는, 나는 ‘블랙프라이어스’(‘도미니크 수도회’라는 뜻임. 도미니크 수도회 1215년에  안 좋아진 가톨릭의 정신에 청빈한 생활과 개혁을 넣고자 생긴 수도회. 물론 이 수도회도 나중에 가톨릭처럼 안 좋게 변함-_-;; 아닌가???

몰랐다.\\n\\u3000한 시간 후 극이 끝나고 극장을 나설 때까지도 나는 그것에 대해 생각하고 있었고 문 가까이에서 나를 기다리고 있던 그(웹슬 씨)를 발견하기에 이르렀다.\\n\\u3000“어떠세요?” 우리가 악수를 나눔과 동시에 거리로 함께 들어서며 내가 물었다. “절 보신 거 아니었어요?”\\n\\u3000“암 봤지, 핍 군!” 웹슬 씨(53세, 연극배우)가 대답했다. “그래, 내가 자네를 봤네. 하지만 거기에 또 누군가 있지 않았나?”\\n“그  밖에 누군가라니요?”\\n\\u3000“정말 기절초풍(매우 놀랄)할 노릇이야.” 자신도 의식하지 못한 사이 웹슬 씨가 다시 한 번 넋을 놓기 시작하며 말했다. “그럼에도 불구하고 나는 그게 그라는 것을 맹세할 수 있다네.”\\n\\u3000그 놀라움 속으로  나까지 빨려드는  것을 느끼며 내가 “방금 말씀하신 것의 의미가 무엇입니까?”라며 대답을 재촉했다.\\n\\u3000“자네가 관객석에 있지 않았더라도 내가 그를 알아봤을까마는,”라며 웹슬 씨가 또 다시 아까 와 같이 넋을 놓으려는 듯 발언했다. “나도 장담할 순 없다네. 하지만 난 결국 그를 알아봤을 것이네, 암.”\\n\\u3000나는 나도 모르는 사이에 내 주위를 둘러보기  시작했다. 귀가할 때  내가 늘 미행이 없는지 확인했듯이 말이다. 그의 이 애매한 단어들이 내게 한기(추움)를 느끼게 했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“아! 그는 지금 이 곳에 없다네,”라며 웹슬 씨(53세, 연극배우)가 말했다. “그는 내가 무대에서 퇴장할 때 자리를 떴으니까. 그가 나가는 것을 내가 무대 뒤에서  보았다네.”\\n\\u3000이미 의혹을 품고 있었기 때문에 나는 이제 심지어 이 가엾은 엑스트라까지 의심했다.\\n\\u3000나는 그의 의도를 의심했고 그가 혹 나를 꼬드겨 프리비스(죄수)에 관한 일을 털어놓게 만들려는 것은 아닌지 불안했다.\\n\\u3000그로 말미암아 나는 우리가 걸어가는 동안 그를 한 번 이상 힐끗 쳐다보게 되었다. 하지만 그는 그 이상 아무 말이 없었다.\\n\\u3000“이런 엉뚱한 상상을 했군. 난  자네가  그 자가 함께 온 줄 알았었거든, 핍 군. 그가 자네 뒷좌석에 유령처럼 앉아 있는 것을 자네가 전혀 알아차리지 못하는 것을 볼 때까지 말이야.”\\n\\u3000방금 느낀 한기(추움)가 또 다시 내 등뼈를 타고 올라오는 것이 느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000하지만 아직까지는 나(23세, 주인공)는 말하지 않을 작정이었다. 왜냐하면 나를 꼬드겨 이러한 얘기들과 프로비스(57세, 죄수)를 연결시 키려한다고 내가 그를 의심해도 앞뒤 상황이 맞아떨어졌기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000물론, 나는 프로비스가 관객석에 있지 않았다는 사실을 확신하며 완전히  안심한 상태였다.\\n\\u3000“뭐 내(53세, 웹슬 씨=연극배우)가 자넬 놀라게라도 하는가, 핍군. 아무래도 자네가 좀 놀란 것 같아서 말이네. 하지만 정말 이상한 일 아닌가! 내가 지금부터 내뱉을 말을 자넨 믿지 않을 걸세. 나도 내 눈을 의심했었으니까 말이야,  아닌가?”\\n“글쎄요?”라며  내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그래 글쎄가 아니라니까 그러네, 핍 군. 기억나나 예전 우리가 다함께 모였던 크리스마스 날 말이네, 자네가 아마 12살 정도였을 때지, 우리가 자네 매형(조 가저리=힘세고 착한 대장장이)의 집에서 식사를 하고 있을 때였지. 그때 몇몇 병사들이 문가로 몰려와 쇠고랑(수갑) 한 쌍을 고쳐 달라고 하지  않았나?”\\n“그건 저도 잘 기억하고 있는걸요.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 곧이어 두 탈옥수들에 대한 추격이 시작된 것도 기억나는가, 우리도 병사들 틈에 합류하지 않았는가, 가저리(주인공 매형의 이름 / 주인공과 35세라는 큰 나이 차이가 남 / 성 씨가 ‘조’이고 이름이 ‘가 저리’임)가 아마 자네를 등에 업고 갔었지. 내가 선두에 서고 자네들은 내게서 뒤처지지 않으려고 애를 쓰고 있었지?”(실제로는 이 반대였음. 힘이 센 가저리가 주인공을 등에 업고서 선두에 서고 어린 주인공은 힘들어서 꾸벅꾸벅 졸고 교회서기였던 웹슬 씨는 병사들을 따라 걷는 것이 너무 힘들어서 우리들만이라도 돌아가자고 말했지만 가저리가 우 리도 병사들처럼 끝까지 가봐야 한다면서 우기는 바람에 웹슬 씨는 힘 들어서 울 지경인데 돌아가지도 못해 쩔쩔맸음)\\n\\u3000“저도 잘 기억하고 있어요, 아저씨.” 실제론 이때 아마 내가 그(웹슬 씨)보다 더 잘 기억하고 있었을 것이다. 그가 선두에 섰다는 마지막 얘기만  제외하면 말이다.\\n\\u3000“그럼 자넨 우리가 도랑(진흙투성이 개천)가에서 그 두 탈옥수들을 찾아낸 것도 기억나는가, 그 두 탈옥수들 사이에 격투가 벌어지고 있 었고, 그들 중 한 명이 상대방 죄수에게 호되게 얻어맞아 얼굴 여기저기 살갗이 찢겨지는 많은 상처를 입었던 것도 기억하는가?”\\n“모두 눈앞에 선한 걸요.” \\n\\u3000“그리고 병사들이 횃불들을 밝혔었지, 그리고 그 두 탈옥수를 쇠고랑에 채워 행렬 중간에 끼고서 걸어갔지. 우린 그 사건이 어떻게 귀결 (결론)되는지를 지켜보기 위해 그들을 따라갔었고. 아마 칠흑 같았던 늪지대를 다 지나갔었지. 횃불이 그 두 죄수의 얼굴들 위로 비치는 채 말이야. 내가 주목하는 것은 바로 그것이네. 우리 둘레로 온통 검은 밤의 바깥 원이 형성되었을 때 그 횃불이 그 두 죄수의 얼굴들을 비추었던  일말이네. 기억하는가?”\\n“그럼요,” 내가 말했다. “저도 다 기억나는 걸요.”\\n\\u3000“그러니까, 핍 군, 그 두 죄수들 중 한 명이 오늘 밤 자네 뒤에 앉았었다 네. 내가 무대 위에서 자네 어깨 너머로 본 게 바로 그 자란 말  이지.”\\n\\u3000‘(주인공이 자기 자신에게 하는 말) 진정해!’라며 나는 정신을 가다듬었다.\\n그런 다음 그(웹슬 씨)에게 재차 확인했다.\\n\\u3000“그럼 오늘 밤 아저씨께선 그 두 죄수들 중 어느 쪽 사람을 보았다고  생각하신다는 건가요?”\\n\\u3000“왜 있지 않은가, 얼굴 여기저기에 살갗이 찢겨져 나가는 많은 상처를 입었었던 남성 말이네.” 그가 마치 준비하고 있었다는 마냥 술술 이야기를 풀어갔다. “내가 본 사람이 바로 그 자라네! 암 맹세할 수 있 고말고! 그 자를 생각해내면 낼수록 내가 오늘 밤 본 것이 그 자라고   더욱 더 자신할 수 있지 뭔가.”\\n\\u3000“이상한 일인데요!” 나는 그것이 내게 별 중요한 일이 아니라는 듯  내가 꾸밀 수 있는 한도까지 최대한  가장하며  말했다.  “정말 이상한 일도 다 있군요!”\\n\\u3000이런 대화(웹슬 씨가 주인공이 앉아 있던 좌석 뒤에 있던 죄수를 봤다는 얘기)가 나를 더한 불안상태로 몰아넣었음은 아무리 강조해도 지나치지 않다.\\n\\u3000또한 ‘콤피슨’(옥스퍼드 출신의 철저한 사기꾼)이 마치 내 뒤에서 유령처럼 서 있는 것 같은 유별나고도 기분 나쁜 공포를 내가 느껴야했음을 아무리 강조해도 지나치지 않다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 프로비스의 은둔이 시작된 이래로 내가 이제까지 내 생각들 속에서 잠시도 콤피슨(사기꾼)을 지울 수 없었음에도, 이와 같은 때에 그 자가 내게 가장 접근해 있었다니.\\n\\u3000내가 매우 조심하였는데도 내가 경계를 늦추었고 실은 전혀 그를 의식하지 않았다는 생각을 하니  이건 마치 도둑을 방지하기 위해  100개  의문을 걸어 잠그는 조바심을 냈다가 문득 정신을 차려보니 내 팔꿈 치에서 도둑을 발견한 것과  같았다.\\n\\u3000내가 극장에 있었기 때문에 그도 또한 거기로 온 것임은 이제 의심할 바 없는 사실이었다. 게다가, 주변에 있을 지도 모르는 위험이 아무리 사소해보일지라도 그 위험은 아주 가까이에 있으며 수면 아래서 활 발히 움직이고 있는 위험임은 의심할 바도 없었다.\\n\\u3000나는 “그 남자가 언제 쯤 객석으로 들어온 것 같았습니까?”라는 식의 여러 질문들을 웹슬 씨(53세, 연극배우)에게 던졌다.\\n\\u3000그는 기억하지 못했다. 그는 객석에서 ‘나(23세, 주인공)’을 봤고 그런 후 내 어깨 너머에 있는 그를 보았다는 것이다.\\n\\u3000게다가 첫눈에 알아본 것도 아니고 잠시 기억을 더듬어보고서야 알았다고 했다. 하지만 우선은 막연하게나마 그를 나와 연결시킬 수 있었고 그래서 예전 시골에 있을 때 내게 속한 누군가로 그 남성을 생각 했었다는 것이다.\\n“그가 어떤 차림새를 하고 있었죠?”\\n\\u3000“부유한(부자) 차림새를 하고 있더구나. 하지만 다른 것은 눈여겨보지 못했네.”\\n그가 생각하기에 검정색 양복을 착용하고 있었던 것 같다고 했다. “그렇다면  아직도  얼굴에  찢겨진  상처가  남아  있던가요?” \\n“아니네, 지금 생각으론 그런 건 없었던 것 같아.”\\n\\u3000그 생각은 나도 마찬가지였다. 왜냐하면 아무리 내가 음울한(답답한) 생각에 잠겨 내 뒷좌석에 누가 앉는지 전혀 눈여겨보지 못했다손 치더라도 만약 얼굴에 찢겨진 상처가 있는 자였다면 어떤 식으로든 내 눈길을 끌었을 것이기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000웹슬 씨(53세, 연극배우)가 뽑아낼 수 있는 모든 기억과 내가 그에게서 뽑아낼 수 있는 모든 것을 그가 내게 전해준 후 그리고 “오늘 피곤 하셨죠.”라며 내가 그에게 적절한 비용의 간단한 다과(음식)를 대접해준 후, 우린  헤어졌다.\\n\\u3000템플(런던 한복판, 주인공의 숙소가 있는 주택단지 / 동서남북으로 주택단지 내부로 통하는  출입구가  있음)로  돌아와서  보니  시계침이 밤 12시와 1시 사이를 가리키고 있었다. 출입구 들은 모두 닫혀 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 출입문 안으로 들어서고 숙소로 들어올 때까지도 내 주변엔 아무도 없었다.\\n\\u3000허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)가 돌아왔을 때, 우린 벽난로 가에 앉아서 심각하게 이 문제에 대해 논의했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그 날 밤에 내가 알아낸 정보를 웨믹(45세, 변호사사무실의 서기)에게 전달해주고 우리가 그의 신호(언제 인도로 출국하면 안 잡힐지)를 기다리고 있음을 그가 기억하도록 다시 한 번 알려 주는 것 외에는 사실 우리가 할 수 있는 게 전혀 없었다.\\n\\u3000그렇다고 그의 성(웨믹의 오두막 같이  작은 통나무 집)으로 너무 자주 가면 이는 또 그를 위태롭게 하는 길일 수도 있었음으로 나는 일단 그에게 오늘 일을 편지로 알리기로 했다.\\n\\u3000나는 침대에 들기 전에 편지를 작성했고 밖으로 나와 부쳤다. 그때까지도 내 주변엔 아무도  없었다.\\n\\u3000허버트와 나는 우리가 더욱더  신중을  기울여야한다는  것에  동의했다. 사실 그걸 빼곤 우리가 할 수 있는 게 아무것도 없기도 했다.\\n\\u3000우린 정말이지 조심하고 또 조심했다. 전보다 훨씬 더 주의를 기울였다. 더 주의를 기울일 게 있었다면 말이다.\\n\\u3000나(23세, 주인공)로서는 내가 노(보트의 노)를 저을  때를  제외하곤 일절 ‘중국인들이 사는 강 유역(프로비스<57세, 죄수>가 은둔해 있는  곳)’ 근처로 가지  않았다.\\n\\u3000그리고 그럴 때에도 나는 그 밖에 다른 장소를 쳐다보듯이 만 ‘제분 소(방앗간)가 있는 저수지(인공 못) 제방(둑)’ 쪽으로 눈길을 줄 뿐이었다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 48장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000나는 47장에서 두 차례의 만남에 대해 얘기했었다. 첫 번째 만남이  있고 약 1주일 후에 그 두 번째 만남이 있었다.\\n\\u3000어느 때처럼 오후 좀 이른 시각에 다리 아래 선착장에 내 보트를 남겨두고 “젠장 밥은 어디서 먹지?”라며 헷갈려 하다, 일단은 ‘치프사이드 시티’(런던의 시티 중 하나)까지 어슬렁거리며 산보를 했다.\\n\\u3000부지런히 움직이는 사람들의 군집들 속에서 영락없이 가장 갈데없는 사람마냥 그렇게 거리를 따라 걷고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그때 어떤 사람이 성큼성큼 나를 따라잡더니 큰 손바닥을 내 어깨    위에 얹었다.\\n\\u3000그건 재거스 씨(50세, 런던에서 가장 유명한 변호사)의 손이었다. 그가 내 팔에 팔짱을 끼었다.\\n\\u3000“같은 방향인 것 같군, 핍(23세, 주인공이름), 같이 좀 걷겠나. 그래 목적지는 어딘가?”\\n\\u3000“템플(주인공의 숙소가 있는 동네)요, 제 생각 엔요.”라며  내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그럼 자네도 모른단 말인가?” 재거스 씨(50세, 런던에서 가장 유명한  변호사)가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“글쎄요,” 어쨌든 이번 한 번만은 그와의 대화(디킨스는 ‘반대신문’이라고 적었음)에서 선수를 칠 수 있었던 것에 만족해하며 내가 대답 했다. “글쎄요, 아직 제 마음이 결정을 못 내린 건 아닐까요?”\\n\\u3000“저녁 먹을 생각 아니었나?”라며 재거스 씨가 말했다. “자네도 마다 하진  않겠지, 아닌가?”\\n“네.”라며 내가 대답했다. “마다하진  않죠.”\\n“선약(약속)은 없겠지?”\\n“제가 선약이 없는 걸 굳이 마다하는 편은 아닙니다.”\\n\\u3000“잘 됐군.” 재거스 씨(50세, 런던 변호사)가 말했다. “같이 저녁이나 먹으러 가세(자신의 집으로 가자는 의미임).”\\n\\u3000‘젠장 내가 왜 이 양반 말에 맞장구를 쳤을까!’라며 거절하려는 찰나에 그래서 내가 뭐라고 몇 단어를 말하려던 찰나에 재거스(50세, 런던에서 가장 유명한 변호사. 재거스 변호사는 굉장히 날카롭게 말하는 스타일임)가  이렇게 덧붙였다.\\n\\u3000“웨믹(45세, 재거스 변호사사무실의 서기. 선량한 사람임)도  온다네.”\\n\\u3000그 말에 나는 거절하려고 꺼내었던 단어들을, 사실 그 단어들은 승 낙(수긍)의 말로도 받아들일 수 있는 단어였기 때문에 어쨌든 그의 제안을 받아들였다.\\n\\u3000우린 ‘치프사이드 시티’(런던의 시티 중 하나) 거리를  따라 걷다가 ‘리틀 브리튼’(재거스 변호사사무실이 있는 거리이름. 지금 2014년 런 던지도기준으로 보면 모두 런던 한 복판임. 당연히 이 소설이 쓰일 당시엔 한적한 곳이었겠죠?) 쪽을 향해 비스듬히 방향을 틀었다.\\n\\u3000그러는 사이 쇼윈도(상품진열창)의 조명들이 휙 켜지기 시작했고, 오후의 붐비는 틈바구니들 속에서 램프를 켜기 위해 놓을 사다리를 댈 충분한 공간을 찾지 못한 ‘거리 가로등 램프를 켜는 사람들’은 폴짝거  리며 뛰어다니거나 이 거리 안과 저 거리 안을 들락거리며 뛰어다니고 있었다.\\n\\u3000‘후머스 호텔’(안 좋은 지역이었는데  이 소설이  쓰일  당시에는  호텔 이 생겼다고 함. 구글 검색 참조)에서 숙박해야 했을 때 깡통구멍을 통해 ‘골풀 양초’(갈대 같이 생긴 골풀을 기름에 녹여

있는 거리이름. 지금 기준으로는 런던 한 복판임)에 있는 사무실(재거스 변호사사무실)에선 평상시와 같이 재거스 씨의 편지쓰기와 비누로 손 씻기, 그리고 웨믹 씨의 촛불심지 자르기와 금고 잠금 확인 절차가 그 날 하루사무의 종료로써 행 해졌다.\\n\\u3000내가 재거스 씨 집무실 벽난로 가에 한가로이 서 있는 동안, 벽난로의 불길은 솟아올랐다가 가라앉았다하면서 선박 위에 있던 두 개의 주물(쇳물을 녹여 만든 흉측한 사람 얼굴 모양의 주물)이 마치 나와 함께 사람 기분 엄청 안 좋게 만드는 까꿍(숨었다가 보였다가 하는) 놀이를 하는 마냥 여러 표정을 만들고 있었다.\\n\\u3000한편 재거스 씨(50세, 런던에서 가장 유명한 변호사)가 편지 쓰는 동안 구석에서 희미하게 불을 비춰주고 있던 굵고 땅딸막한(키 작고 뚱뚱한) 한 쌍의 사무실 초는, 마치 교수형에 처해졌었던 다수의 의뢰인 들을 기념하는 더러운 수의를 입은 마냥 촛농들로 떡칠이 되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000우린(주인공, 제거스, 웨믹) ‘제라드 거리’(재거스 씨의 집이 있는 거리이름, 당시엔 런던 서쪽에 있던 한적한 거리였음. 지금은 런던 중앙에 위치)로 향했다. 나와  재거스  그리고  웨믹 이렇게 세 명이서 말이다. 물론 전세 마차(택시 개념)를 타고.\\n그곳에 도착하자마자 저녁식사는  준비되었다.\\n\\u3000비록 내(23세, 주인공)가 재거스 씨의 집에서 웨믹(45세, 재거스 변 호사사무실의 서기)의  월워스(웨믹의  집) 의견(주인공이 처한 일에 대해 웨믹 씨의 개인적이고 우호적인 의견)에 대해 표정으로조차도 언급할 의향이 전혀 없었다손 해도 그럼에도 불구하고 그가 때때로 우호적인 시선으로 내게 눈빛을 던지는 것까지 반대할 의사는 전혀 없었다.\\n하지만 그건 어림 반 푼어치도 없는 일이었다.\\n\\u3000그는 식사 도중에라도 식탁에서 고개를 들 때면 항상 재거스 씨(50세, 런던의 유명한 변호사)에게만 눈길을 주었으며 내게는 마치 그 자리에 쌍둥이 웨믹이 앉은 마냥 감정

없나? 아닌가) 근처의 어느 ‘헛간’(문이 없는 창고)에서 발견 된 것입니다. 격렬하게 다툰 흔적이 있었습니다. 아마도 싸운 흔적 같았습니다. 살해된 피해 여성은 멍이 들었고 할퀴고 찢겨진 흔적이 있었습니다. 그리고 목이 졸려 결국엔 질식사한 경우였습니다. 사건  당시  이  어린(17세)  여성(이름이  ‘몰리’. 에스텔라의 친어머니. 에스텔라는 몰리를 전혀  모름)을  제외하고는  이  사건에  연류 되었을 것 같은 어떤 혐의자도 찾지 못한 상태였습니다. 그리고 이 어린 여성이 자신보다 더 몸집이 커고 힘이 센 피해 여성을 목 졸라 죽이는 일은 일어날 법하지 않다는 것이 재판 당시 재거스 씨(당시 27세, 갓 개업한 변호사)의 주요한 변론 요지였습니다.

전 다만 마님께서 제 얘기에   귀 기울이지 않으시는 것 같아서 말을 멈춘 것뿐이에요.”\\n\\u3000“아마도 내가 그런 모양이다.”라며 그녀가 한 손을 머리에 대며 말했다. “계속 말해 보거라. 딴 곳을 쳐다보고 있으마. 아니 넌 가만있어 라(그 자리에 있어라)! 자 계속 얘기해다오.”\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴(56세, 어마어마한 부자)이 단호한 태도로 자신의 목발 지팡이 위에 손을 얹었다. 그건 이제부터 내 말을 경청해 듣겠다는 강한 표시였다. 그녀가 벽난로의 불을 쳐다봤다.\\n나는 계속해서 설명을  시작했다.\\n\\u3000“제 선(돈)에서 그 거래를 마무리 지으려고 했지만 그 사이에 일이 틀어져 저도 어쩔 수 없게 되었습니다.”\\n나는 또 그녀에게 이렇게  일려두었다.\\n\\u3000“일이 틀어진 이유에 대해선 지금 설명드릴 순 없습니다. 또 한 사 람(‘에스텔라’를 말함. 에스텔라의 미스 해비샴의 양녀. 얼마 전 에스텔 라는 ‘벤틀리 드러믈’과 결혼했음. 벤틀리 드러믈은 주인공의 라이벌이었음)의 중대한 비밀이 관여되어 있기 때문입니다.”\\n\\u3000“그래서!” 미스 해비샴(56세, 어마어마한 부자)이 고개로는 동의를 나타내며 그러면서도 내 쪽은 보려하지 않으면서 말했다. “그래 얼마면 되겠냐? 그 일을 완수하는 데 얼마가 부족한 거냐?”\\n\\u3000나(23세, 주인공=실속 없는 런던신사=파산직전)는 말하기를 머뭇거렸다. 왜냐하면 내게 생각해도 너무 큰 금액이었기 때문이다.\\n나는 말했다.\\n\\u3000“4억 5천만 원이요.” (19세기 말 영국 돈 900파운드는 2015년 현재 우리나라 물가 기준으로 대략 3억 6천만 원 쯤 합니다. 하지만 이왕 계산하는 거 통 크게 잡아서 4억 5천 만 원으로 적었음 :) 뭐 제 돈도 아닌데요. 뭘ㅋㅋ 이럴 땐 통이 큼 :)ㅎㅎㅎ)\\n\\u3000“만약 내가 그 돈으로 그 일을 마무리 지어라고 준다면, 네 자신을 비밀을 지켰듯이 내 비밀도 지켜주겠느냐?”\\n“네 성심성의껏 꼭  지킬게요.”\\n“이제 네 마음이 한층 편안해질 것 같으냐?” “훨씬요. 아주 훨씬 편안해질  것  같아요.” \\n“그럼 지금은 아주  불행하니?”\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴은 마지막 질문(“그럼 지금은 아주 불행하니?”)을 하며 여전히 나를 쳐다보지 않으려 들었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그녀의 말투에는 이례적으로 나를 동정하는  듯한  분위기가 서려 있었다.\\n나는 즉각  대답을  할  순  없었다.  목소리가  안  나왔기  때문이다. 그녀가  자신의  목발지팡이  꼭대기에  왼팔을  얹었다.  그러더니 천천\\n히 자신의 이마를 왼팔 위에 놓았다.\\n\\u3000(주인공이 하는 대사임→) “전 전혀 행복하지 않습니다, 미스 해비샴 마님. 하지만 마님께서  헤아리시는  그 이유 때문만은  아니에요. 다른 말 못할 이유가 더 있습니다. 하지만 지금은 마님께도 얘기해드릴 수 없는 비밀입니다.”\\n\\u3000잠시 후 미스 해비샴이 고개를 들어 또 다시 벽난로의 불을 쳐다보았다.\\n\\u3000“훌륭한 신사가 다 되었구나, 핍. 불행의 원인들이 다른 데 있다고  말할 정도로 말이다. 그래 그게 사실이냐?”\\n“너무도  사실이에요, 마님.”\\n\\u3000“내가 네 친구를 통해서만 너를 도울 수 있는 거냐? 핍. 그것이 실행되었다고 치면, 내가 너만을 위해 따로 더 해줄 건 없겠니?”\\n\\u3000“전혀요. 그렇게 물어봐 주신 것만으로도 감사한 걸요. 특히 그걸 물 어봐주실 때 담아주신 마님의 따뜻한 말투에 전 훨씬 더 감사함을 느끼는 걸요. 전 다만 그것이면 족합니다.”\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴(56세, 어마어마한 부자)이 곧 의자에서 일어났다. 뭔가    를 적기 위해 좀 더 밝은 곳을 찾았다.\\n하지만 밝은 곳이라고 할 만한 곳이 그 방엔 없었다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 호주머니에서 변색된(흐릿해진) 금으로 장식된, 노란 상아빛깔의 ‘편지지 첩’(한 장씩 떼어내 쓰는 편지지 첩)을 꺼내 그 위에다, 자신의 목에 매달려 있던 변색된(흐릿해진) 금제품 케이스(상자) 안에 있던 ‘석필(그림 그리는 연필)로’ 뭐라고 적었다.\\n\\u3000“넌(23세, 주인공. 어리버리 런던신사=지금 파산직전) 여전히 재거스 씨(50세, 싸가지 변호사. 미스 해비샴의 재산관리 대리인)와 친한 사이겠지?” (미스 해비샴은 재거스 씨를 약간 두려워하고 있음. 재거스 변호사가 워낙에 똑똑한 막말을 해대는 스타일이라)\\n“예. 아주요. 어젠 그의 집에서 저녁도 먹었는걸요.”\\n\\u3000“자, 이건 그보고 너에게 거기 적힌 금액을 지급해도 좋다는 신용장 (신용장에 적힌 사람에게 일정 금액을 지급해도 좋다는 지급 위탁서)이다. 그 금액에 한해 네 자유 재량껏 네 친구(이름이 ‘허버트’)를 도울 수 있을 게다. 지금 이 집엔 그 정도의 금액이 없다. 하지만 이 일에 대해 재거스 씨(변호사)가 전혀 모르길 네가 만약 바란다면, 내가 후에 따로 너에게 그 돈을 부쳐주마(보내주마).”\\n\\u3000“고마워요, 미스 해비샴 마님. 저도 재거스 씨를 통해 그 금액을 수령하는 것에 전혀 이의가  없어요.”\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴(56세, 어마어마한 부자)은 자신이 쓴 신용장 내용을 내게 읽어주었다. 신용장 내용은 정확하고 분명했다. 듣기에도 그녀가 나를 배려한 것 같았다. 내가 그 돈을 수령함으로써 이익을 얻을 거란  의심을 일절 들지 않게 하려는 배려인 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 들고 있던 노란 상아빛깔의 ‘편지지 첩’(한 장 씩 데어내 쓰는 편지지 첩을 통째로 주었다는 얘기임)을 내게 건네주었다. 그녀의 손이 또다시 와들와들 떨렸다. 그리고 ‘석필’(방금 편지지 첩에다가 신용장을 쓴 연필)이 달려 있던 그 목걸이를 벗어 내 손에 담아줄 때 그녀의 손은 전보다 훨씬 더 심하게 떨리고 있었다.\\n이 모두를 그녀는 나를 쳐다보지 않으면서 했다. \\n\\u3000“내 이름은 첫 번째 낱장에 적혀 있다. 네가 어느  때고  내 이름 아래에 ‘전 그녀를 용서했어요.’라고 적어줄 수 있겠니. 그게 비록 내 ‘실 연’(결혼식 당일 날 하객들이 모여 있는 자리에  결혼식을 거행할  시간이 되어도 신랑이 나타나지 않았음. 미스 해비샴의 예비 신랑은 미스 해비샴에게 결혼을 빙자한 사기를 치고 돈만 받고 도망갔음. 그때 입은 마음의 상처를 말함)이 티끌이 된 아주 오랜 후가 될지라도 말이다. 어느  때고 좋다.”\\n\\u3000“오! 미스 해비샴 마님.” 내가 말했다. “전 아무 때도 좋아요. 지금 당장이라도 써드릴 수 있어요. 뼈아픈 실수들은 저도 해온걸요(주인공은 유산상속을 약속받고 런던으로 상경하자마자 시골에 있는 매형과 누나를 잊었음). 지금까지 제 삶은 눈멀고 감사할 줄 모르는 삶이었습니다. 그래서 마님을 힐난하기엔 제겐 용서와 관리가 너무도 부족한 걸요.”\\n\\u3000내게서 시선을 돌린 이후 처음으로 그녀가 내 쪽으로 고개를 돌렸다. 그리곤 놀랍게도 그녀가 내 발 앞에 무릎을 꿇었다. 난 급기야 공포심까지  느꼈을 정도다.\\n\\u3000그녀가 깍지 낀 두 손을 내게 들어올렸다. 그 모습은 그녀가 분명  자신의 엄마 곁에서 하늘을 향해 두 손을 들었을 때의 그러한 태도였다. 물론 그녀의 가련한 마음씨가 아직 여리고 어리며 그 무엇으로도 가공되지  않았을 그때에.\\n\\u3000내 발 앞에 무릎을 꿇은 채 앉아 있는 그녀의 새하얀 머리카락과 헐벗어진 얼굴을 보고 있자니 나는 전기에 감전된 것 같은 큰 충격을 느 꼈다.\\n\\u3000나는 “제발 좀 일어나시라”고 탄원했다. 그녀가 일어설 수 있게 내 두  팔로 부추겨주었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그녀는 다만 자신의 손과 가장 가까이에 있던 내 손을 아래로 누르고 있을 뿐이었다. 그리곤 내 손 위로 고개를 숙이고는 울 뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그 전까지 결코 그녀가 허물어지는(우는) 것을 본 적이 없었다. 바라건대 그 눈물이 그녀에게 안식이 되길 바란다.\\n나는 말없이 그녀 위로 몸을 숙였다.\\n이제 그녀는 무릎을 꿇고 있는 것이 아니라 바닥에 퍽 쓰러졌다. \\n\\u3000“오!” 그녀가 절망적으로 소리쳤다. “내가 무슨 짓을  했든가!  내가 무슨  짓을 했어!”\\n\\u3000“그 질문이, 당신이 제게 상처를 입히기 위해 당신이 무엇을 해왔는지를 물으시는 것이라면, 미스 해비샴 마님, 제가 말씀드리게 해주세요. 아무것도요. 당신은 제게 아무것도 상처 입히지 않았습니다. 상처를 입힌 건 그녀 앞에서도 어쩔 수 없었든 제 자신이에요. 전 어떤 상황이었든지 그녀를 사랑하고 말았을 거예요. 에스텔라는 결혼했나요?”\\n“그래.”\\n\\u3000에스텔라가 결혼했느니 안 했느니 하는 질문은 물어볼 필요도 없었던 질문이었다. 왜냐하면 이 외딴 저택에서 느껴지는 비워낼 수 없는 슬픔이 이미 내게 그 사실을 일려주고 있었기 때문이다.\\n“내가 무슨 짓을 했니!

나왔다. 그 문들은 한때 에스텔라(♥)가 내 심장을 쥐어짠 직후(12살 때 에스텔라♥는 주인공보고 “이 천한 막노동꾼 소년아!”라고 비웃었음) 내가 분에 박쳐 머리를 짓눌려 대던  그 문짝들이었다.\\n\\u3000앞뜰로 나온 ‘나는’ 아까 그 가사도우미를 불러 내가 나갈 수 있게 정문의 잠금장치를 풀어 달라고 할지 아니면 이대로 위층으로 다시 올라가서

화로 바로 곁에 그녀가 앉은 의자가  있었다. 그녀의 등은 내 쪽을 향해 있었다.\\n\\u3000조용히 그 자리를 벗어나려고 내가 막 고개를 돌리려는 찰나, 큰 불길이 확 타오르는 것이 보였다. 그와 동시에 그녀가 비명을 지르며 내 쪽을 향해 달려오는 모습이 보았다.  그 불길은  그녀의 옷 곳곳으로 옮겨 붙어 소용돌이치듯 그녀를 휘감고 있었다. 그 불길은 그녀의 머리  위로 적어도 그녀의 키 만큼이나 높이 치솟고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 이중 망토(입지 않고 어깨 위로 걸치는 외투)로 덮인 길고 무거운 헤비코트(천이 두터운 큰 외투)를 입고 있었고 내 손에 또 다른 두터운 외투를 걸쳐 들고  있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 헤비코트(큰 외투)를 벗고, 그녀에게 달려들어, 그녀를 넘어뜨리고, 벗은 헤비코트(큰 외투)로 그녀의 몸을 덮었다. 동일한 목적으로 결혼식 테이블 위에 있던 큰 천을 세게 잡아당겼다. 그와 동시에 이제껏 결혼식 테이블 위에서 외부와 단절된 채 자신만의 둥지를 틀고 있었던 온갖 추한 것들과 결혼식 테이블에 산더미처럼 쌓여 있었던 부패 더미들이 같이 끌어져  내려왔다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴과 나는 불천지 원수를 만난 마냥 바닥 위에 뒤엉켜 싸웠고 내가 내 헤비코트(큰 외투)로 그녀의 불 붙은 몸을 가까스로 다 덮으려하면 할수록, 그녀는 더욱더 사납게 비명을 질러대며 내 헤이코 트(큰 외투) 안에서 벗어나려고 기를 썼다.\\n\\u3000이 일을 나는 결과를 통해서 알았지 불 끌 당시에는 내가 한 행동을 느끼지도 생각하지도 깨닫지도  못했다.\\n\\u3000난 아무것도 몰랐다. 우리가 커다란 결혼식 테이블  옆 바닥에  쓰러져 있다는 사실을 내가 인지했을 때까지 난 아무것도 몰랐다. 그리고  방금 전까지 그녀의 빛바랜 신부용 드레스였던 천 조각들이 연기 자욱한 공중에 둥둥 떠다니며 부싯깃마냥 여전히 타들어가고 있음을 내가 인지할 때까지 나는 아무것도 느끼지 못했다.\\n\\u3000그때 나는 뒤를 돌아보다 어지러이 소란 떨고 있는 딱정벌레들과 바닥 위를 듬성듬성 건너뛰고 있는 거미들과 그리고 문간에서 숨을 헐떡이며 뛰어오고 있는 남녀 가사도우미들을 보았다.\\n\\u3000그때까지도 나는 여전히 사력을 다해 미스 해비샴을 내리누르고 있었다. 도망가려는 죄수를 붙들 듯이 말이다.\\n\\u3000나는 순간 그녀가 누구인지를 내가 아는지조차 의심이 들었고 우리가 왜 그토록 뒤엉켜 싸웠는지조차 의심이 들었다. 그리고 그녀가 불길에 휩싸였었는지 또는 그 불길이 크게 번졌는지조차 의심이 들었다.\\n\\u3000적어도 내 의심은 한때 그녀의 옷이었던 천 조각들이 더 이상 공중에 뜬 채 불타지 않고 우리 주위 바닥 위로 검은 소나기가 되어 떨어질 때까지 계속되었다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴은 의식이 없었고, 그래서 난 가사도우미들이 그녀를 움 직이려거나 또는 심지어 그녀를 건드리려는 시도조차 겁내했다.\\n\\u3000의사를 부르러 사람을 보낸 나는 의사가 도착할 때까지도 그녀를 붙들고 있었다. 마치 내가 그녀를 놓아주기라도 하면 화염이 다시 한 번 터져올라 그녀를 휘감고 말리라는 비이성적인 상상이라도 내가 하고  있는 마냥 나는 그녀를 붙들고 있었다.\\n\\u3000외과 의사가 다른 도우미와 함께 그녀를 돌봐주기 위해 도착하고 내가 자리에서 일어났을 때, 나는 그제야 내 두 손이 화상을 입은 것을 보았다. 왜냐하면 나는 감각을 통해서는 그것을 전혀 인지하지 못했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000의사가 검사해보니 그녀는 심각한 정신적 충격을 받은 상태였다. 하지만 의사 말로는 가망이 없고 뭐 그런 것과는 전혀 관계가 없다고 말 했다(괜찮다는 말).\\n위험한 요소는 대개 정신적 충격과 관련 되어 있었다.\\n\\u3000외과 의사의 지시에 따라, 사람들이 그녀의 침상(누워 잘 수 있는 평상)을 그 방 안으로 옮긴 후 그 침상을 커다란 결혼식 테이블 위에 올려놓았다. 공교롭게도 그 커다란 결혼식 테이블은 그녀의 상처들을 붕 대로 감기게 아주 적합한 테이블이었다.\\n\\u3000내가 그녀를 다시 볼 수 있을 때가 그러니까 사건 발생 후 거의 한 시간이 지났을 무렵이었다. 그녀는 조용히 누워 있었다. 정말로, 내가 이 저택에 처음 왔을 때 그녀 자신이 자신의 목발지팡이(목발=지팡이) 로 그 결혼식테이블을 내리치며 자신이 언젠가 여기에 누워 있을 거라고 말하던 그 결혼식 테이블 위에 그녀는 정말로 누워 있었다.\\n\\u3000비록 그녀가 입고 있던 신부용 드레스의 천들이 모두 불에 타고 말았지만, 사람들이 내게 말했듯이, 그녀는 여전히 예전 그 소름끼치는 신부의 형상 같은 무언가를 지니고 있었다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 사람들이 소독한 솜(탈지면)으로 그녀를 목까지 감은 상태였고, 그리고 새하얀 시트(침대시트)를 그 위에 느슨하게 덮은 상태로 누워 있었기 때문에, 결혼식이 파토난 날  유령같이  변했었다가 소독한 솜과 시트로 감싸인 지금 또 변한 결과 유령 같은 어떤 분위기가  그녀 위에 서려 있었기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000가사도우미들에게 질문을 하자마자 나는 에스텔라(♥)가 파리에 머무르고 있다는 사실을 알게 되었다. 나는 외과의사에게 다음 우편 편으로 에세텔라(♥)에게  이번 사건  소식을  전해 달라는 약속을 받아두었다.\\n\\u3000미스 해비샴의 친척들에게 이번 사건 소식을 알리는 것은 내가 맡기로 했다. 나는 일단 매튜 포킷(53세, 매튜 포킷은 미스 해비샴의 사촌 오빠임. 25세의 미스 해비샴이 사기꾼 남성에게 빠져 허겁지겁 결혼하 려하자 유일하게 끝까지 반대하다 미스 해비샴과 심하게 말다툼을 벌인 후 다시는 서로 안 만나고 있는

저녁(미스 해비샴의 옷에 화롯불의 불길이 번진 사건 당일 저녁) 무슨 일이 일어났었던 건지에 대해 그녀가 차분하게 읊조리는 시기가 한 차례 있었다. 비록 어떤 서투른 명량함을 그녀가 보이기 했지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000밤 12시가 가까워지면서 그녀의 얘기는 다시 오리무중 헤매기 시작했다. 밤 12시 이후부터는 점점 낮고 침통한 음조(목소리)를 띄기 시작하더니 급기야 자신이 했던 말들을 셀 수도 없이 반복하기 시작했다.\\n“내가 무슨 짓을  했든가!”\\n\\u3000그리고 또, “그 애(에스텔라)가 처음 여기에 왔을 때, 난 단지 내 자신이 겪어야했었던 불행에서 그 애를 구해주고 싶었을 뿐이었어.”\\n\\u3000그리곤 또, “(주인공을 보며) 연필을 가져다 편지지 첩에 있는 내 이름 아래에다가 ‘그녀(미스 해비샴 자기 자신)를 용서한다!’고 적거라.”\\n\\u3000그녀는 이 세 가지 문장의 순서를 절대 뒤바꾸는 법이 없었다. 하지만 그녀는 때때로  자신이 하려던 문장에서  한 두  단어를  놓쳤다. 하지만 절대 그 자리에 다른 단어를 넣지는 않았다. 매번 그렇게 자신이 하려던 단어를 빈칸으로 남겨두고 그 다음 단어를 이어갔다.\\n\\u3000내가 거기(미스 해비샴의 저택)서 더 할 일이 없었기 때문에, 그리고 그녀의 종잡을 수 없는 횡설수설조차도 내 마음에서 몰아낼 수 없는 가중하는 근심과 두려움의 이유가 런던 집에 더 가까이 있었기 때문에 나는 오늘(그날) 밤중에 내일 아침 이른 마차 편으로 상경하기로 마음 먹었다.\\n\\u3000일단은 1.6킬로미터(km. 어른 걸음으로 걸어서 24분 거리) 쯤 걸어서 읍(마을)을 벗어난 후 오는 마차를 잡아타기로 결심했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 대략 6시 정도의 아침에 난 일단 테이블 위에 잠들어 있는 그녀 위로 상체를 구부려 그녀의 입술에 가볍게 입맞춤을 해주었다. 하지만 내 입술이 닿는 그 순간까지도 그녀의 두 입술은 쉴세, 없이  이렇게 말하고 있는 것만  같았다.\\n\\u3000“연필을 집거라, 그리고 내 이름  아래에다가  이렇게  적거라. ‘나(23 세, 주인공)는 그녀(53세, 미스 해비샴)를 용서한다.’고.”\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 50장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000나는 두 손에 화상을 입은 상태였다. 밤에 두 번 또는 세 번 소독한 솜으로 감싸야했으며 아침에 다시 한 번

심하게 화상을 입지 않아 손가락들을 움직일 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000물론 오른 손에도 붕대로 감싸야했지만 적어도  왼손이나  왼팔보단 훨씬  덜 불편했다.\\n\\u3000삼각건(삼각형의 헝겊)으로 왼손과 왼팔의 무게를 견디게 하고서, 망 토(소매 없는 외투)  같은 내 헤비코트(외투)를 어깨 위로 느슨하게 풀고 대신 헤비코트를 목에 고정시키고서야 나는 간신히 내 헤비코트를  걸칠  수 있었다.\\n\\u3000머리카락들도 불길에 감싸이긴 마찬가지였지만 다행이도 얼굴과 머리에 직접적인 화상을 입진 않았다.\\n\\u3000허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)가  ‘해머스미스(런던서쪽  템스  강옆,  이 당시엔 ’런던 너머‘이고 현재는 ’런던 안‘임, 주인공이 신사교육을 받았던 집)’로 내려가 부모님(허버트의 아버지는 미스 해비샴의 친척오 빠임)을 만나 뵙고 우리 숙소(런던)에 있던 내게 다시 돌아와 나를 정성껏  종일 보살펴주었다.\\n\\u3000녀석은 정말 이 세상에서 가장 친절한 간호사였다. 일정한 시간마다 붕대들을 풀고서 그 붕대들을 미리 준비해놓은 냉각액(차가운 물?)에  담가 두었다가 도로 꺼내 내가 깊은 고마움을 느꼈을 만큼이나 부지런한 친절함으로 붕대를  감아주었다.\\n\\u3000소파 위에 가만히 누웠을 때 처음에는 그것이 고통스러울 만치 힘들었다.\\n\\u3000화염의 눈부신 빛이며 사람들이 놀라 허겁지겁 소리 지르던 것이며 타는 냄새가 지독히 나던 것들에 대한 인상을 내 머릿속에서 지우래야 지울 수가 없었다.\\n\\u3000요행이 내가 아주 잠깐 눈을 붙었을 때조차도 나는 어디선가 들리는 미스 해비샴의 비명소리들과 그녀의 머리 위로 그녀의 키만큼이나 치솟던 불길에 휘감겨 내 쪽으로 뛰어오던 그녀의 모습에 깜짝 놀라 나는  깨곤 했다.\\n\\u3000이 심적인 고통은 내가 입은 육체적 고통보다도 훨씬 더 나를 괴롭히고 있었다. 그걸 본 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)는 내 주의를 딴 곳으로 돌리려고 옆에서 부단히 애를 쓰고 있었다.\\n\\u3000보트(인도까지 가는 배를 몰래 타기 위해 런던에서 가장 가까운 항 구도시까지 몰래 가기 위해 템스 강의 물길을 알기 위해 보트 연습을 하는 것을 말함)에 대해서는 우리 둘 중 누구도 언급하지 않았다. 하지만 우리 둘 모두 그것에 대해 생각하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그 문제에 대한 언급을 기피(회피)함으로써, 그리고 내가 두 손을 사용할 정도로 회복하는 일이 수주일이 아니라 수 시간 내에 치료가능한 문제가 되게 만들어야한다는 것에 서로가 동의함으로써, 굳이 말은 안 하지만 우리 둘 다 보트에 대해 생각하고 있음을 분명히 하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 허버트를 만났을 때 내 첫 질문은 당연히 “강 아래쪽 일들은 모두 무탈해?”이었다.\\n\\u3000허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)가 확신과 완벽한 쾌활함에 차서 “오케이고 말고!”(← 원문에 없는데 그냥 삽입해봤음 :) 제가 자주 사용하는 말이거든요)라며 아주 긍정적으로 대답했기 때문에, 우린(주인공과 허 버트) 그 문제를 낮(햇빛)이 차츰 닳아 없어질 때까지 다시 꺼내지 않 았다.\\n\\u3000하지만 벽난로에서 뿜어 나오는 빛의 세기가 바깥에 있는 빛의 세기보다 더 세 지자 허버트가 붕대를 교체하며 자연스럽게 그 문제를 끄 집어냈다.\\n“어젯밤에 프로비스(57세, 죄수)를 만나고 왔어, 헨델(주인공의 애칭\\n=별명). 두 시간 정돈 머물렀던 것 같아.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 클라라는 어디에 있고(20세 클라라=허버트의 약혼녀)?” (부연 설명 : 프로비스는 ‘클라라’와 ‘클라라의 아픈  아버지’가 머물고 있는  집의 맨 위층에 이름을 바꾸고 머물고 있음)\\n\\u3000“그 가엾은 것은!”라며 허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)는 말했다. “클 라라(20세, 허버트의 약혼녀)는 ‘험상궂은 퉁퉁 이’(=퉁명스럽고 험상 궂은 사람=허버트가 클라라의 아버지를 지칭하는 말임) 씨 때문에 저녁 내내 1층과 2층을 오르내리느라고 정신이 없었어. 자기 딸이 시야에서 사라지자마자 쉴

내가 그 가엾은 꼬마 소녀(20세 아가씨)를 어떻게 보살펴줄 수 있겠니? 팔을 뻗어서 소파 등 위에  놓을래. 내겐 그녀보다  네가 더 꼬마 소년 같으니까. 잠깐만 여기 좀 앉고 보자. 일단 네 붕대 들부터 조금씩 벗겨내야 하니까. 조금씩 뗄 게 아프지 않게 말이야. 그래 이 얘길 하다 말았지. 난 어젯밤 프로비스(57세, 죄수)와 얘기를 나 누었어. 아니, 헨델(주인공의 애칭=별명)? 그는 사람이  확  달라졌어. 좋은  쪽으로 말이야.”\\n\\u3000“나도 네게 말했잖니, 그(57세, 프로비스)가 부드러워졌다는 인상을 받았다고. 지난번에 그를 마지막으로 봤을 때 이미 느꼈는걸.”\\n\\u3000“네가 말한 그대로야. 부드러워졌다는 표현이 정확해. 어젯밤에도 나랑 있는 데 아주 수다스러우시더라. 자신의 지나온 삶에 대해서도 내게 많이 말씀하셨어. 그거 기억나? 왜 전에 그가 지나온  과거를  얘기하다 자신을 힘들 게 했었던 어떤 여성에 대해 언급하려다 멈칫했었잖아? (주인공이 움칫 하는 것을 보고) 붕대 아프니?”\\n\\u3000나는 정말 움칫 했었다. 하지만 그건 허버트의 손이 상처에 닿아서가 아니었다. 그가 사용한 단어들(어떤 여성이 그를 괴롭혔다)이 나를 깜짝 놀라게 했던  것이다.\\n\\u3000“난 이제껏 잊고 있었었어, 허버트(23세, 주인공의  절친).  네가 그 말을 하니까 나도 방금 그게 기억나는 걸.”\\n\\u3000“참! 그가 그 얘기도 하더라, 자기 삶에서 가장 어둡고 터무니없었던 (사나웠던) 시절의 얘기 말이야. 너에게 들려주고  싶은데  들어볼래? 아 님 지금은 네가 아프니까 좀 그렇고 나중에 들려줄까?”\\n“그딴 걱정하지 말고 어서 말 해봐. 그가 한 얘기 모두 다 말이야.” \\n\\u3000허버트(23세, 주인공의 절친)가 좀 더 가까이서 나를 보려고 몸을 앞으로 구부렸다. 마치 내 요구가 그가 애초 예상한 내 반응보다 훨씬 더 조급하고 열을 올린 마냥.\\n“너  머린  괜찮니?”  그러면서  그는  내  머리를  만져보았다. “괜찮으니까 말을 했지.”라며 내가 말했다. “딴 얘기 좀 하지 말고\\n어서 프로비스(57세, 죄수)가 네게 들려주었던 그 얘기나 마저 해봐.      이  뚱딴지같은 녀석아.”\\n\\u3000“열은 없는 것 같아.” 허버트가 말했다. “(풀린 붕대를 보며) 붕대 하나가 풀린 게 매력적인데. 자 시원한 붕대를 댈게. (붕대를 감싸며) 처음에는 붕대가 차가워서 움츠러들 거야. 불쌍한 녀석, 어때? 하지만 차가운 건 곧 괜찮아질 거야. (푼 붕대를 챙기며) 그 여자는 나이 어린 여성이었더네나봐. 샘(질투심)이 많은 여자였데. 그리고 복수심에 불타 앙심을 품고 있던 여자였고. 내 말 이해하니, 헨델, 복수심 말이야, 복수심의 마지막 단계까지 가 있던 여성이었더네나 봐.”\\n“어느 정도까지를 말하는  건데?”\\n\\u3000“살인을 저질렀대. (주인공의 붕대를 보며) 민감한 부위인데 너무 쓰라리고  그러진 않니?”\\n\\u3000“쓰라리진 않아. 그래 그녀가 어떻게 살인을 했다는 거야? 누굴 죽 였다는데?”\\n\\u3000“글쎄, 그 행위(살인)가 모름지기 그대로 무서운 명칭을 받을 만한 게 아니었을지도 몰라.”라며 허버트가 말했다. “하지만 그녀(당시 20세)는 그 혐의로 재판을 받았고, 그래서 재거스 씨(당시 30세, 갓 개업한 상태의 변호사)가 그녀를 변호해주었데, 그 변론의 세평(평판)을 듣고 프로비스도 처음으로 재거스 씨의 이름을 알았다고 해. 또 다른 그러니까 희생자는 더 힘이 센 여성이었다데.  사건  현장에는  격렬하게 다툰 흔적이 있었고… ‘헛간’(문짝이 없고 입구만 있는 창고)에서. 어느 쪽이 먼저 싸움을 시작했는지 또는 그것이 정당방위였는지 아닌지 의문투성이였데. 하지만 결론은 확실히 의문이 아닌 쪽으로 났지. 왜냐 하면 희생자가 목이 졸려 숨져 있었으니까.”\\n“그래서 그 여성은 유죄판결을 받았데?”\\n\\u3000“아니. 그녀는  무죄를 선고받았데. (붕대를 보며)  이런 내가 널 아프게 했구나, 헨델?”(헨델은 주인공의 애칭=별명)\\n\\u3000“별로 아프지도 않은걸 뭐, 그런데 허버트. 응? 그 밖에 또 다른 얘기는 없었어?”\\n\\u3000“그리고 무죄 선고를 받은 이 여성(당시 20세)과 프로비스(당시 34세)의 사이에는 귀여운 어린아이(당시 3살)가 하나 있었데. 그 애를 프로비스는 끔찍이도 귀여워했다고 하더구나. 내가 네게 들려준 대로 그녀(아이의 어머니)의 질투심의 대상이었던 여성이 교살(목이 졸려 죽 음)된 바로 그 날 저녁에, 그녀(아이의 어머니)가 아이 얘기를 꺼내기  위해 프로비스 앞에 잠시 나타났었대. 그리곤 ‘그 애를 죽일 거예요. 죽이고 말겠어요.’라고 맹세했대. 아이는 당시 그녀가 데리고 있었고.  그 이후론 프로비스는 그 아이를 두 번 다시 보지 못했다고 하더라.  그리고 재판이 끝남과 동시에 아이의 엄마도 자취를 감추어버렸데. (주인공의 팔을 바라보며) 한 번 만 더 삼각건(붕대) 안으로 네 왼쪽 팔(상처가 가장 심한 왼팔)을 넣어보자. 그럼 좀 편안해질 거야. (주인 공의 오른손을 바라보며) 이제 오른손만 남았네. 그게 훨씬 더 쉬운 일 이지. 난 대낮보다 이런 약한 조명 아래에서 더 뛰어난 간호사란다. 조 명이 희미하면 화상 후 생긴 수포(물)들로 헐거워진 헝겊조각들이 잘 보일리 없잖니. 그럼 내 손도 안 떨릴 테고.

댈 수 있을 때까지 어느 한적한 장소에서 휴식을 취하고 있을 계획이었다.\\n\\u3000그것이  어디가 되었든 간에, 외국의 증기선이 우리가 숨어 있을 장소를 지나갈 시각쯤이야 사전에 조사만 해둔다면 우리가 그 시각을 거의 완전히 계산할 수 있을 것이기 때문이었다.\\n\\n\\u3000(알림 : 이후 『위대한 유산』의 주된 무대가 ‘그레이브젠드’(런던 동쪽에 있는 항구)라고 말한 것은 거짓말인데 -_-;;; 여하튼 꼭 지도로 위치를 대충이라도 확인하셔야 이후 이 소설을 이해하기가 쉽습니다. 아시겠죠????? 위의 지도 클릭~ 위치 꼭 확인하셔야 합니다.-_-+...)\\n\\n\\u3000허버트(24세, 주인공의 절친)도 이 모든 것(=주인공의 의견 = 강 하류에 휴식을 취하고 있다가 지나가는 외국 증기선에 배를 대 탄다)에 동의했다. 우리는 아침을 빨리 먹은 후 즉시 외국 증기선들의 운행시  간을 조사하러 밖으로  나갔다.\\n\\u3000우리는 알았다. ‘함부르크’(독일 최대의 항구도시)로 가는 배가 우리의 목적에 가장 부합함을 우리는 발견했다. 그래서 우리의 생각도 주로 그 배 쪽으로  기울었다.\\n\\u3000물론 동시간대에 런던을 출발하는 외국 증기선들의  목록들도  잊지 않고 수첩에 적어두었다. 우린 증기선들의 모습과 색깔을 알게 된 것에 만족했다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 우린 몇 시간동안  헤어져, 나는 필요한 여권들을 한꺼번에 챙기러 가고, 허버트는 스타톱의 하숙방으로 찾아가 스타톱(주인공 들보다 1살이 많음. 주인공의 동료)을 만났다.\\n\\u3000우리 둘 다 어떤 방해도 없이 애초 계획을 성공적으로 완수했다. 오후 1시에 우리가 다시 만났을 때 우린 우리가 거든 성과에  대해  서로 에게 보고했다.\\n\\u3000나로서는 여권들을  준비한  상태였고, 스타톱은 허버트에게서 “합류할 만반의 준비가 되어 있어.”란 말을 들은 상태였다.\\n\\u3000그래서 허버트와 스타톱이 한 쌍이 되어 보트의 노를 젓기로 하고 나는 키(보트의 방향)를 잡기로 했다. 그리고 우린 프로비스(59세, 죄 수)는 착석 자(앉은 사람)가 되어 조용히 있게 하기로 결정했다.\\n\\u3000속도는 목표가 아니었기 때문에 우리는 충분히 길을 만들 수 있을 것이다.\\n\\u3000우린 그 날 저녁엔  허버트가  ‘제분소(방앗간)가  있는  저수지(인공 못) 제방(둑)’에 들렀다가 저녁을 먹으로 집으로 오기로 정했다. 대신  내일 저녁엔 그러니까 화요일 저녁엔 절대 허버트가 ‘제분소(방앗간)가 있는 저수지(인공 못) 제방(둑)’ 근처에도 가지 않기로 정했다.\\n\\u3000수요일 출발 당일 우리의 보트가 접근하는 것이 보이는 정확한 시각에 프로비스가 숙소 옆에 있는 배를 끌어올리는 곳까지 올 수 있도록 허버트가  준비시키기로 결정했다.\\n\\u3000그 모든 채비(준비)는 월요일 밤에 프로비스와 합의를 보아야하며, 월요일 이후부터 프로비스는 어떠한 일이 있어도 우리가 그를 보트에  태울 때까지는 우리와 전혀 연락을 해서는 안 된다고 정했다.\\n\\u3000우리 모두 이러한 예방조치들을 충분히 주지한 후(이해한 후) 나만 집으로 돌아왔다.\\n\\u3000우리 숙소의 덧문(문 바깥에 덧붙여 다는 문)을 내 열쇠로 열자마자, 나는 우편함에 편지 한 통이 있는 것을 발견했다. 나에게 온 편지였다. 표면이 아주 지저분한(더러운) 편지였다. 비록 글씨체는 악필이 아니었 지만 말이다.\\n내가 집을 나선 후 사람 손으로 배달 된 편지인 것 같았다. 편지에 담긴 내용은  이러했다.\\n\\u3000〈 오늘 밤이나 내일 밤 9시에 ‘늪지대’(주인공 시골 마을 뒤편에 있는

것은 내가 빨리 결심해야하며 그렇지 않을 경우 내가 시골로 내려가는 오후 마차를 놓칠 거라는 사실이었다. 그 마차를 잡아탄다면 적어도 오늘(월요일) 밤 9시까진 내려갈 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000내일(화요일) 밤에 가는 것은 상상할 수도 없었다. 왜냐하면 그렇게되면 밀항을 위한 도피 시각과 너무 가까웠기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000게다가 잘은 모르겠지만 들려주겠다는 그 정보가 우리의 탈출과 관련된 어떤 중요한 정보와 관련이 있을지도 몰랐다.\\n\\u3000만약 내게 충분한 시간이 있고 그래서 이 문제에 대해 숙고를 더 해 보았다하더라도 나는 분명 시골로 내려갔을 거라 믿는다.\\n\\u3000그런데 지금은 생각할 시간도 없었기 때문에 나는 바로 내려가기로 결심했다. 시계를 보니 30분 후면 마차가 출발할 시각이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 당연히 내려가선 안 되었다. 하지만 내 아저씨 프로비스(59세, 죄수)와 관련된 사항이었기 때문에 어쩔 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000웨믹의 편지도 받았고 아침부터 바삐 채비를 한 것이 형세를(시골로 내려가 보겠다는 주인공의 결심을) 결정적으로 만들다.\\n\\u3000극단적으로 서두를 때는 어떤 편지가 되었든 대략적인 내용이라도 파악하기가 매우 어려워진다. 그래서 나는 이 이상한 ‘서한’(=편지=시 같은 느낌이 나는 이해하기 어려운 편지)을 두 번이나 읽어야 했다. 그런 후에야 편지 내용을 비밀로 해야 된다는 편지 속 권고를 기계적으로 받아들였다.\\n\\u3000동일한 기계적 방식에 따라 나는 연필로 메모 한 장을 허버트에게 남겼다.\\n\\u3000〈 허버트 나야, 너무 갑작스럽게 떠나야하고 얼마나 외국에 있어야 될지도 몰라서 나가기 전에 미스 해비샴의 일이 어떻게 되었는지 직접 확인해보려고 급하게 내려갔다 오기로 결심했어. 〉\\n\\u3000그런 다음 가까스로 내 외투를 걸치고 가까스로 숙소 문을 잠그고 좁은 뒷길을 통해 역마차(=승합마차=시외버스) 매표소로 향했다.\\n\\u3000만약 전세마차(택시)를 타고 거리를 지났더라면 역마차 시간에 맞추지 못할 뻔했다. 터미널에 도착하자 터미널에서 나오는 역마차를 간신히 잡아탈 수 있었기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000내가 정신  차렸을 때, 역마차  안에  손님이라곤  나뿐이었다. 게다가  내 몸은 무릎까지 올라오는 밀짚(말 먹이) 속에서 끊임없이 덜컹거리고 있었다.\\n\\u3000편지를 받은 이후부터 나는 평상시의 내 자신이 정말이지 아니었다. 아침부터 허겁지겁 서두른 이후 뒤따른 편지라 너무도 당황스러웠던 것이다.\\n\\u3000그 날 아침의 서두름과 소동은 엄청났다.(부연설명 : 주인공은 이 날 아침에 웨믹으로부터 1통의 편지를 받았고 오후 늦게 다시 1통의  익명의 편지를 받았습니다.) 왜냐하면 내가 웨믹으로부터 소식을 너무도 오랫동안 갈망해왔었기 때문에 그가 보낸 편지에 담겼던 암시도 뜻밖의 일로  받아들여졌기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그건 그거고(-_-) 나는, 내가 왜 마차 안에 타고 있는지 내 자신에게 놀라기 시작했다. 그리고 내가 마차에 타고 있을 충분한 이유가 있는지 의심해보기 시작했다. 그리고 내가 즉시 마차에서 내려 귀가해야 하는 것은 아닌지를 생각해보기 시작했다. 그리고 어쨌든 발신인의 이름이 안 적힌 그 편지에 주의를 기울인 것에 대해 내 자신을 헐뜯기 시작했다. 서두르는 사람들이 많이 겪는 그러한 부정(아님)과 주저함의 모든 단계들을 나는 통과(경험)하기  시작했다.\\n\\u3000그럼에도, 프로비스(59세, 죄수)의 이름이 언급된 것이 나머지 모든 문제들을  억누르고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그것이 무엇인지 알지도 못하면서 이미 내린 결론이었지만, 만약 이 것도 추론(생각)이라면, ‘혹시라도 내가 가지 앉아 프로비스에게 어떤 위해(위험)가 닥칠 경우 도대체 내가 어떻게 내 자신을 용서할 수 있 겠는가!’라는 결론을 나는 내렸던  것이다.\\n\\u3000도착하기도 전에 이미 날은 어두워졌다. 그래서 바깥 풍경도 거의 보이지 않았고 왼팔을 자유롭게 움직이지 못하는 상태여서 마차가 정류장에 멈추었을 때도 마차 안에만 있었다. 내게 이번 여행은 길고도 처량한 여행이었다.\\n\\u3000‘외설적인 수퇘지(주인공 시골마을 인근에 있는 ’읍내 여인숙‘이자 술집이름이자 마차정류장이름)’을 피한 나는 읍 아래에 있던 그보다 좀 더 낮은 단계의 여인숙에 묵었다. 그리고 약간의 저녁을 주문했다.\\n\\u3000저녁 식사가 준비되는 동안 나는 ‘새티스 하우스’(미스 해비샴의 저택. 읍 외곽에 있음)로 가 그녀의 면회를 요청했다. 그녀는 여전히 몸이 매우 안 좋았다. 비록 외관상은 전보다 나아보였지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000내가 묵은 여관은 한때(옛날에) 고대의 교회 건물 중 일부였다. 식사는 여관 휴게실에서 했는데, 휴게실이 약간 8각형이라 꼭 세례용 물을 담는 그릇 같았다.\\n\\u3000팔이 불편해 내 스스로는 고기를 썰 수 없었기 때문에 나이 지긋한  가게 주인이 대신 썰어주었다. 그의 머리는  어찌나  대머리든지  빛이 나지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었다.\\n\\u3000그가 나대신 고기를 썰어주는 동안 대화를 하게 되었다. 그는 내 자신의 이야기(주인공의 성공 스토리 즉 유산 상속 사건은 이 지역에선 지방신문에 까지 나왔을  정도로  유명함)로  나를  즐겁게  해주려고 애쓸 만큼 정이 있는  사람이었다.\\n\\u3000물론 펌블추크(능청맞은 잡곡상임, 72세 / 주인공은 펌블추크 씨를  몹시 싫어함 / 주인공을  우습게보다가  주인공이 막대한 유산을 상속받게 되자 상전 모시듯 하기 때문임)가 내 초기의 은인이며 내 성공의 기초 설계자라는 통속적인(널리 알려진) 지방신문기사 내용 그대로였지만 말이다.\\n“그 젊은이를 아십니까?”라며 내(23세)가 물었다.\\n\\u3000“그를 아냐고요!”라며 여관 주인장이 흥겨워하며 말했다. “알다마다요. 그 청년이 그러니까 엄마 뱃속에 있을 때부터 봐 왔는걸요.”\\n“그가 언제고 이 고장에 다시 돌아 온 적이 있습니까?”\\n\\u3000“아하, 그가 오고 말 곱쇼.”라며 여관 주인장이 말했다. “자신의 절친한 친구들을 찾아오는 뎁쇼. 때때로 말입니다. 하지만 정작 자신을 지금의 위치에 있게 해준 그 분께는 쌀쌀맞게 대한다고 하더군요.”\\n“그 분이라니요?”\\n\\u3000“왜 있잖습니까, 제가 좀  전에  말씀드린,”라며  여관  주인장이 말했다. “펌블추크 씨 말입니다.” (부연설명 : 펌블추크 씨는 능청맞은 잡곡상임, 72세. 주인공은 펌블추크 씨를 몹시 싫어함. 주인공을 우습게 보다가 주인공이 막대한 유산을 상속받게 되자 상전 모시듯 하기 때문임)\\n“그 청년이 그 밖에 다른 사람들에게도 은혜를 모든 답니까?”\\n\\u3000“그럴 수만 있다면 분명 그렇게 했을 겁니다요.”라며 여관 주인장이 대꾸했다. “하지만 어림 반 푼어치도 없는 일 입쇼. 왜냐 굽쇼? 펌블추 크(능청스런 잡곡상, 72세)가 그 젊은이를 위해 모든 일을 했기 때문입죠.”\\n“펌블추크란 사람도 그렇게  말합니까?”\\n\\u3000“그렇게 말하나굽쇼!”라며 여관 주인장이 응답했다. “그에겐 그렇게 말할 이유가 하나도 없는  걸숍.”\\n“그러니까 그도 그렇게 말하던 가요?”\\n\\u3000“만약 그가 설명하는(‘일러바치는’이란 의미도 있음) 것을 듣는다면 어느 누구의 피든 그냥 확 ‘백포도주 식초’(=화이트와인 비네거=발효 ‘식초’를 말함)로 변하고 말거니까요.”\\n나는 생각했다.\\n\\u3000‘그럼에도 불구하고 ‘조’(58세, 주인공 매형의 이름. 나이차이가 많이남), 사랑하는 조, 당신만은 자랑하지 않지.  인내심이  강하고 애정이 깊은 조, 당신만은 내게 어떤 불평도 하지 않지. 그리고 너, 마음씨 고운 ‘비디’(현재 30세, 주인공이 런던으로 상경하면서 찬 여자) 너도 그 렇고!’\\n\\u3000“사고(사건 사고 할 때의 ‘사고’)가 식욕에 영향을 미친 것 같군요.”라며 여관 주인장이 내 외투 아래에서 붕대에 감겨 있는 왼쪽 팔을 흘낏 쳐다보며 말했다. “부드러울 때 한 입 드셔 보십시오.”\\n\\u3000“아, 사양하겠습니다.”라며 내가 테이블 쪽에서 벽난로 불 위쪽으로 방향을 바꿔 불을 째며 말했다. “더 이상 먹지 못할 것 같습니다. 음식은  치워주셔도 됩니다.”\\n\\u3000조(58세, 주인공의 매형)에 대한 내 배은망덕함에 대해 오늘 만큼 이토록 뼈저리게 내 자신이 인식된 적이 없었다. 비록 그것이 뻔뻔스럽고 철면피 같은 협잡꾼(사기꾼) 펌블추크(능청스런 잡곡상, 72세)를 통 해서였지만 말이다.\\n\\u3000펌블추크가 내게 위선을 떨면 떨수록 조는 내게 더욱더 진실했고, 펌블추크가 내게 비굴하면 비굴할수록 조는 고결하고 또 고결하게 나를 대해주었다.\\n\\u3000벽난로의 불을 한 시간 혹은 그 이상의 시간동안 유심히 쳐다보는 동안 내 심장은 철저히 그리고 너무도 마땅히 겸손해지고 또 겸손해지고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그때 벽시계가 갑자기 울리는 바람에 문득 정신을 차렸다. 하지만 그렇다고 우울과 양심의 가책에서 내가 깨어난 것은 아니었다.\\n\\u3000나는 자리에서 일어나 내 목 둘레로 내 외투를 다시 고정시킨 후 밖으로 나갔다.\\n\\u3000나는 예비적으로 그 편지를 호주머니 속에서 다시 찾아보았다. 목적지로 향하기 전에 편지 내용을 한 번 더 숙지(확인)하고 싶었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 없었다. 아마도 역마차 안에 있던 밀짚더미들 속에 떨어뜨리고 왔음이 틀림없었다. 그렇게 생각하니 불안해졌다.\\n\\u3000하지만 약속장소가, ‘늪지대’(주인공 시골 마을 뒤편에 있는 늪지대) 위 ‘석회 굽는 가마’ 옆에 있는 ‘작은’, 수문지기의 ‘집’(=약속장소)라는 사실과 약속시간이 오후 9시라는 것은 내가 이미 잘 알고 있던 바였다.\\n\\u3000나는 이제 곧장 늪지대쪽으로 향하고 있었다. 여기서 꾸물거릴 시간이 하나도 없었기  때문이다.\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 53장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000어두운 밤이었다. 담으로 에워싸인 읍 지역을 떠나 늪지대로 들어섰을 땐 비록 보름달이 떠오르고 있었지만 어두운 밤이었다.\\n\\u3000비록 늪지대의 어두운 선 너머로 안개가 끼지 않은 한 줄기 맑은 하늘이 보였지만 거대하고 붉은 달을 품기에는 가혹하리만치 폭이 충분히 넓지 못했다.\\n\\u3000몇 분 후 보름달은 그 안개 끼지 않은 맑은 영역에서부터 상승해 위로 차곡차곡 쌓여 있던 엄청난 구름들 사이로 올라가 버렸다.(그래서 어두운 밤이었다는 얘기죠. 한 문장으로 표현할 수 있는데 -_- 이렇게 길게 묘사를 하다니  -_-)\\n\\u3000우울한  바람이 불고 있었다. 늪지대는 말 그대로 쓸쓸함 그 자체였다. 이 장소에 처음 오는 사람도 우울한 바람과 쓸쓸한 늪지대를 견딜 수 없으리라는 사실을 금방 알게 될 것이다. 심지어 나에게 조차도 그 바람과 늪지대는 너무 가혹해서 난 되돌아갈지 말지를 망설일 정도였다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이미 이골이 난 곳이었고 이보다 훨씬 더 어두운 밤하늘 아 래에서도 지나간 적이 있는 장소였다. 그래서 이미 늪지대까지 와서 되돌아갈  핑계가 없었다.\\n\\u3000그래서 내 뜻과는 상관없이 여기까지 왔듯이 나는 또 내 뜻과는 상관없이  계속해서 나아갔다.\\n\\u3000내가 나아가는 방향은 내 옛 고향집이 있는 방향이 아니었다.  또한  내가 7살 때 조와 웹슬 씨 그리고 군인들과 함께 죄수들의 뒤를 쫒으며 나아갔던 방향도  아니었다.\\n\\u3000내 등은 폐선이 된 감옥선 선체 쪽을 향해 있었고 나는 그 반대 방향을 향해 계속 걸어가고 있었다. 비록 모래톱(모래가 깔린 큰 벌판)들 위 저쪽 멀리 떨어진 낡은 등대에서 불빛들이 보였지만 어디까지나 어깨 너머(뒤에서 비침)로 보일 뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000포병부대가 버리고 간 ‘오래된 포대’를 내가 잘 아는 만큼이나 나는 ‘석회 굽는 가마’도 잘 알고 있었다. ‘오래된 포대’와 ‘석회 굽는 가마’ 사이에는 수 킬로미터의 간격이 놓여 있었다.\\n\\u3000그러하므로 그날 밤에 불빛이 각각 두 지점에서 타고 있었다면 두 개의 밝은 점들 사이에는 가느다랗고 ‘휑뎅그렁한’(텅 비어 허전한) 지평선 한 줄만이 길게 있었을 뿐일 게다.(뭔 소리?????-_- 가끔씩 내가 해석해 놓고도 무슨 말인지 모를 때가 있음. 어쨌든 쏴리~)\\n\\u3000나는 우선 몇몇  문들로  들어가  문을  뒤로  닫아야했으며,  때때로는 뚝 위 좁은 길에 누워 있는 가축들이 일어나 잔디와 갈대들 사이로 비틀거리며 내려가는 동안 서 있어야 했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 잠시 후 그 늪지대 전체가 온통 내 차지인 것만 같이 느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000그로부터 또다시 30분이 더 지나서야 나는 ‘석회 굽는 가마’ 가까이로 접근할 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000석회는 사람을 질식시킬 것 같은 냄새를 풍기며 굼뜨게(느리게) 타고 있었지만 가마의 불은 완성된 채 내버려 둔 상태였다. 주위에 일하는 사람은 아무도 보이지 않았다.\\n\\u3000매우 가까이에 작은 채석장이 하나 있었는데 내가 걸어가는 길 앞에 곧장 있었으며 그날 작업이 있었던 것 같았다. 채석장 여기저기에 놓여 있는 도구들이며 수레들이 보였기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000이 구덩이(채석장)에서 늪지대 높이까지 좁고 조잡한 길이 나 있었는데 따라 올라가 보니 익숙한, 수문지기의 ‘집’에서 새어나오는 불빛이 보였다.\\n\\u3000나는 걸음을 재촉해 다가간 다음 손으로 문을  두드렸다. 약간의 응답을 기다리는 동안 나는 그 수문(물의 흐름을 조절하는 시설물)이 폐쇄되어 방치되어 있고 타일(사각형 기와 같은 거)을 붙인 지붕으로 된  이 목조 집은 머지않아 폭풍우 한 방에 날아갈 것 같다는 것을 눈치챘다. 물론 지금이라도 당장 쓰려질 것 같은 집이였지만 말이다. 집 주변 진흙이나 ‘개흙’(늪 바닥의 흙)은 석회로 덮여 있었고, 석회 굽는 가마에서 나오는 숨 막히는 연기가 내 쪽으로 유령 같은 움직임으로 기어 나오고 있는 것 등등을 알아챘다.\\n\\u3000여전히 집 안에선 아무런 인기척이 없었다. 나는 다시 노크를 했다. 여전히 대답이 없었다. 나는 문의 ‘걸쇠’(문에 거는 ‘ㄱ’자 모양의 쇠) 를 열 수 있는지  시도해보았다.\\n내 손에 걸쇠(‘ㄱ’자 모양의 쇠)가 솟구치면서 문이 열렸다.\\n\\u3000안을 들여다보니, 켜져 있는 촛불 하나가 식탁 위에 있을 뿐이었다. 긴 의자도 있었고 바퀴 달린 낮은 침대틀 위엔 ‘매트리스’(침대요)도 보였다.\\n\\u3000그 위로 다락도 보였기 때문에 나는 그 쪽을 향해 “거기 누구 안 계 세요?”라고 외쳐보았다. 하지만 아무런 목소리도 들려오지 않았다.\\n\\u3000나는 내 회중시계(작은 시계)를 쳐다보곤 9시가 지났음을 알게 되었   다.\\n내가 다시 안쪽을 향해 소리쳤다. “거기 누구 안  계시냐고요?”\\n\\u3000여전히 대답이 없었기 때문에 나는 문 밖으로 다시 나와 이제 어떻      게 해야 할지  망설였다.\\n\\u3000계속해서 비가내리기 시작하고 있었다. 이미 본 가구들을 제외하곤 아무것도 보이질 않았기 때문에 나는 집안으로 다시 들어가 문간(출입구)에 서서 비를 피한 채 어둠 속을 바라보며 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000얼마 전까진 누군가가 여기 있었음이 틀림없으며 곧 되돌아올 것이며 그렇지 않다면 촛불이 켜져 있을 리가 없다고 생각하면서 ‘그럼 양초의 심지가 긴지 짧은지?  라도  봐둘까?’하는  생각이  머리에 떠올랐 다.\\n\\u3000나는 그렇게 하기 위해 몸을  돌려 손으로 초(양초)를 집어 들었다.  그때 어떤 폭력적인 가격에 의해 촛불이 꺼졌고, 그리고 내가 파악한 그 다음 일은 뒤에서부터 내 머리 위로 던져진 당기면 죄어지는 억센 올가미 속에 내가 갇혀버렸다는

(주인공들은 이 ‘로테르담 행 증기선’을 강위에서 잡아타고 밀항을 시도해야함)\\n\\u3000좀 더 가자니, 이번엔 내일 ‘함부르크’(독일 최대의 항구도시)로 향하는 증기선이 보였다. 우린 그 배 앞쪽으로 길게 돌출해 있는 돛대  모양의 둥근 나무(=이것을 ‘제1사장’이라고 함) 아래를 지나갔다.\\n그리고  이제,  보트  뒷부분에  앉아  있던  내  눈  앞에도 ‘제분소(방앗간)가 있는 저수지(인공 못) 제방(둑)’과 선착장(=프로비스가 보트를 타  기 위해 기다리고 있기로 한 장소)이 나타났다. 내 심장은 빠르게 고동치고 있었다.\\n“아저씨 그 쪽에 계셔?”라며 허버트가 내게 말했다. “아니 아직 안 보이시는데.”라며 내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“자아! 아저씬 우리가 보일 때까진 내려오지 않기로 했으니까. 어때 아저씨의 창문 신호가 보여?”라며 허버트가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“안 보이는데, 여기선 어림도 없지. 가만 뭔가 본 것 같은…. 앗, 아저씨다! 자 다들(허버트와 스타톱) 노를 당겨. (잠시 후) 허버트 늦춰.  노를 세워도 될 것 같아!”\\n\\u3000잠깐 동안 우린 선착장(배를 타는 곳)에 가볍게 닿았다. 그리고 아저 씨가 올라탔고 우린 다시 출발할 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000아저씨는 장교용 망토를 입고 있었고 ‘캔버스 백’(손가방을 말함)을 가지고 계셨다. 내가 마음속으로 희망했던 만큼이나 그는 ‘수로 안내인’(배에 타서 배를 안전한 수로로 안내하는 사람)처럼  보였다.  (다행~)\\n\\u3000“이 녀석!”라며 그가 자리에 앉는  동안 자신의 한 쪽 팔을 내 어깨  위에 얹으며 말했다. “이 녀석, 약속을 잘도 지켰구나. 잘 했다. 고맙고  또 고맙구나!”\\n\\u3000우린 또 다시 여러 줄로 정박해 있는 선박들 사이로 들어섰다. 그  선박들 틈을 들락거리며, 교수형 모양 동아줄이 닳아 풀어져 있는 ‘사슬 닻줄들’과 물 위에서 까닥거리고 있는 ‘부표’(물 위에 띄우는 항로 표지)들을 피하기도 하고, 떠내려가고 있던 부서진 광주리(바구니)들이 잠시 가라앉히기도 하면서, 그리고 떠다니고 있는 나무토막들과 그 부스러기들을 흩어버리기도 하면서, 그리고 떠다니고 있는 석탄 찌꺼기들을 가르며 나아가기도 하면서, 여러 줄로 정박해 있는 선박들 사이를  우리는 들락거렸다.\\n\\u3000많은 ‘존’(이름이 ‘존’인 왕과 성인들이 많음)들이 그렇게 연설하듯 강풍을 향해 일장 연설을 하고 있는 ‘선덜랜드’(영국 중부 동해안에 있는 항구도시이름) 호(배)의 ‘존’이라는 ‘선수상’(나무로 어떤 모습을 만들어 배 앞부분에 붙인 거) 아래를 지나,\\n\\u3000딱딱한 조각적 형식을 갖추어 만들어진 ‘가슴’(사람가슴)을 지니고 있으며 그녀의 고개 위로 5센티미터(cm)나 ‘솟구쳐 있는’ 혹같이 ‘둥근 두 눈을’ 가진 ‘야머스’(네덜란드의 암스테르담 바로 맞은편에 있는 영국의 항구이름) 호(배)의 ‘베치’(여자이름. 여자 이름 ‘엘리자베스’를 귀엽게 부른 이름이 ‘베치’임)라는 선수상(배 앞부분의 조각상) 아래를 지나,\\n\\u3000또 그렇게 선박들 사이를 들락날락 하면서, 선박회사 안마당에서 들려오는 해머(쇠망치) 소리들이며, 목재를 자르는 톱 소리들이며, 알 수 없는 물건들에서 나는 엔진들이 충돌하는 소리들이며, 물이 새는 선박들 안에서 들려오는 펌프질 소리들이며, 닻 따위를 감아올리는 장치 소리들이며, 바다로 막 출항하려는 선박들의 소리를 들으며, 방파제를 사이에 두고서 상대방 ‘거룻배 사공’들을 향해 고함치며 뭐라고 말하고 있는데 정작 뭔 소린지 하나도 못 알아듣겠는 선원들 소리를 들으며 우리는 선박들 사이를 들락날락 거리며 나아갔다.\\n그런 후에야 우린 드디어 좀 더 훤히 뚫린 강 위로 나올 수 있었다. 그곳은  배에서  일하는  ‘사환’(심부름꾼  소년)들이  뱃전(배  앞) 완충물(충돌방지용)들을 안으로 옮기는 곳이었다. 뱃전 너머 완충 물에 의 지해 낚시질 한 번 해보려던 것이 거친 파도에 낚시고 뭐고 할 수 없어졌기 때문이기도 했다. 그리고 그곳은 꽃과 색종이들로 장식된 돛들이 바람에 나부끼는 곳이기도 하였다.\\n\\u3000우리가 프로비스(59세, 죄수)를 태운 선착장에서, 그리고 이후로 줄곧 나는 우리가 의심을 받고 있다는 어떤 징후라도 있는지를 방심하지 않고 찾아보았다.\\n하지만 아무도 보이지  않았다.\\n\\u3000확실히 의심 받고 있다는 징후는 없었다. 적어도 그때까지는 우리를 따라오거나 우리와 같이 움직이는 어떠한 배들도 없었다.\\n\\u3000만약 어떤 배가 우리를 따라온다면, 나는 배를 강기슭에 대고 그 배가 반강제적으로 먼저 지나가게 함으로써 그 배의 목적을 분명히 확인했을 것이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 어떤 방해의 흔적도 없었기 때문에 우린 계속해서 나아갈 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000프로비스(59세, 죄수)는 장교용 망토를 입고 있었기 때문에 앞서 내가 말했듯이 자연스러운 그림이 나왔다(강 풍경의 일부분인양 자연스러웠다).\\n\\u3000우리보다 그가 더 걱정이 없어보였다는 것은 주목할 만한 일이었다. 아마도 그가 살아와야 했던 비참함이 그것을 설명해줄 것이다.\\n\\u3000그렇다고 그가 이번 항해를 대수롭지 않게 여기는 것은 아니었다. 왜냐하면 “외국에서, 가장 훌륭한 신사들 중의 한 명이 된 ‘내 신사’ (주인공)를 지켜보며 남은 생을 보내고 싶구나.”라고 내게 말했었기 때 문이다.\\n\\u3000내가 이해하는 한, 그는 순종이니 체념이니 하는 어떤 마음을  갖고  있을 인물이 아니었다. 또한 위험과 타협할 생각도 전혀 없는 인물이 었다.\\n\\u3000만약 예상치 못했던 위험이 자신에게 달려든다면, 그는 맞서 싸울 것이다. 하지만 그것도 그가 위험에 처한 뒤의 이야기일 것이다.\\n\\u3000“얘야, 네가 만일,”라며 프로비스(59세, 죄수)가 내게 말했다. “네 옆(말의 어감이 ‘네 옆’이 아니라 ‘내 새끼 옆’ 뭐 이런 분위기임)에 이렇게 앉아 한 모금 피우는 이 맛을 안다면, 넌 나를 부러워할 것이다. 그것도 몇 날 며칠을 사방이 벽으로 막혀 있는 골방에서 보낸 후엔 말 이다. 하지만 넌 그게 뭔지 모를 게다.”\\n\\u3000“자유가 주는 큰 기쁨들에 대해선 저도 알 것도 같아요.”라며 내가 대답했다.\\n\\u3000“아아,”라며 그가 고개를 근엄하게 흔들며 말했다. “하지만 너의 그 자유란 것은 나의 그것에 비할 만한 것이 아닐 게다. 내 자유를 감당하려면 철창에 갇혀 봐야 할 테니 말이다. 하지만… 난 그런 구렁텅이로 다시 떨어지진 않을 거다(나는 천해지지 않으련다).”\\n\\u3000어떤 주된  관념(생각)을 위해서, 자신의 자유든 혹은 심지어 생명이 든 그것을 위험에 빠뜨려야 한다는 것이 내겐 모순처럼 들렸다.\\n\\u3000하지만 위험이 없는 자유는 그의 생활방식과 너무도 어울리지 않음에 생각이 미쳤다. 그의 자유는 자유라는 단어가 다른 사람에게 주는 어감과는 사뭇 다를 거란 생각이 들었다.\\n\\u3000내 생각은 크게 틀리지 않았다. 그가 한 모금 피운 후 이렇게 말했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“얘야, 넌 알게다, 내가 저쪽(오스트레일리아) 편에 있을 때, 그러고 보니 지구 정반대 편에 있었군, 난 항상 이쪽(영국) 편을 바라보고 있 었단다. 내가 점점 부유해지고 있었음에도 불구하고 그곳에서 지내는 것이 점점 맥 빠지더구나. 누구든 매그위치(프로비스의 실명)를 알았단다. 그리고 매그위치는 어디든 갈 수 있었고 또 올 수도 있었다. 그는  어느 누구의 머릿속에서도 파란을 일으키지 않았지. 하지만 얘야 여기 (영국 런던)선 나에 관해 너무도 편치 않게 생각하는 구나. 적어도 만일 그들이 내가 여기 있다는 사실을 안다면 편치 않아 할 게다.”\\n\\u3000“이번 일(밀항)만 잘 마무리되면요,”라며 내(24세, 주인공, 파산직전의 어리버리 한 영국 런던신사)가 말했다. “이번 일만 잘 마무리되면 몇 시간 내에 아저씬 다시 자유의 몸이 되어 안전해지실 거예요.”\\n\\u3000“글쎄다,”라며 그(59세, 가명이 ‘프로비스’임=오스트레일리아를 탈출 한 죄수임=유형지를 임의로 탈출해 귀국한 죄수는 잡히면 무조건 교수 형임)가 긴 한 숨을 내쉬며 응답했다. “그러길 바란다, 얘야.”\\n“그럼 그렇게 생각지 않으신다는 말씀이세요?” \\n\\u3000‘배(주인공들이 타고 있는 보트를 보트라고 생각해도 되고, 작은 배라고 생각해도 됨) 앞’의 ‘위 끝’ 너머로 프로비스(59세, 죄수)가 살짝 한 손을 담갔다. 내겐 새로울 것이 없는 부드러워진 분위기를 외모로 풍기며 그러면서 미소를 잊지 않은 채 그가 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“흠, 그건 아니란다, 얘야. 다만 우리가 현재 누리고 있는 이 조용하고 간단한 진행과정을 이해 못하겠는 것뿐이란다.(←의역이 좀 심했죠. :) 사실 직역은 이거임→우리가 현재보다 더 조용하고 태평스러울 수 있을지 당혹스럽구나.) 아님 너무도 부드럽고 유쾌하게 물을 헤집고 나아가고 있는 바람에  아마 내가 그런 생각을 하나 보다. 담○ 한 모금 피우고 생각해보니, 내가 이렇게 움켜잡고 있는 이 강의 바닥을 우리가 들여다볼 수 없듯이 우리가 몇 시간 후의 일을 예측할 수도 없는 법이란 생각이 드는구나. 또한 내가 이 강물을 계속 손 안에 쥐고 있을 수 없듯이 우린 시류 (물결)를 거스를 수도 없는 거란다. 보거라, 잔물결들이 내 손가락들 사이로 빠르게 번지다 사라지는 것 을!”\\n\\u3000그러면서 프로비스는 흠뻑 젖어 물이 뚝뚝 떨어지고 있는 자신의 손을 들어보였다.\\n\\u3000“아저씨의 얼굴만 아니었더라도 전  아저씨께서  살짝  우울해 계시다고  생각할  뻔 했어요.”라며  내(24세,  주인공. 파산직전의 어리버리  영국런던신사)가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“난 조금도 우울하지 않단다, 얘야! 너무도 조용히 흘러가고 있는 게 원인이란다, 저기 뱃머리에서 일어나고 있는 잔물결들을 보고 있자니 마치 찬송가를  듣고 있는 것 같은 착각이 들지 뭐냐. 아마도  내가 그새 또 약간 나이를 먹었나 보구나.”\\n\\u3000프로비스(59세, 죄수)가 자신의 파이프(담○)를 다시 입으로 가져갔다. 그의 얼굴에선 동요(혼란)의 흔적을 전혀 찾아볼 수 없었다. 마치 우리가 벌써 영국 땅을 벗어난 것 마냥 그는 차분하고 느긋하게 앉아 있었다.\\n\\u3000그럼에도 불구하고 그는 마치 자기 자신이 지속적인 공포 상태에 처 해있다는 마냥 한 마디의 충고엔 순종적이었는데, 내가 굳이 그렇다고 말한 이유는,  우리가 보트에 실을 맥주 몇 병을 사기 위해 강가 기슭에 닿았을 때, 그도 일어나려하자, 내가 “보트에 가만히 앉아 계시는 게 가장 안전하실 것 같은데요.”라고 넌지시 알리자 그가 “그러냐? 얘 야.”라고 말하면서 다시 자기 자리로 가 조용히 앉았기 때문이었다.\\n\\n\\u3000(“54장”은 해석이 쉽네요. 딱 이정도 영어단어 및 영어문장 수준이 제 취향인데. -_- 디킨스는 글을 이상하게 길게 써려는 버릇이  있는 것 같아서. 음. -_ㅜ 여하튼 이번 54장은 해석이 무척 쉬었음. 오랜만에 만나는 쉬운 글~)\\n\\n\\u3000강 위에서 불어오는 바람이 차갑게 느껴졌지만 여하튼 화창한 날은

동부지역)까지 나아가려든 선박들이 선단을(무리를) 이루며 우리 쪽으로 쇄도하기(오기) 시작했고 그래서 우린 낮은 여울(얕아서 물살이 빠름)들과 ‘진흙 둑’(강에 살짝 튀어나온 흙 언덕)들을 피하며 이젠 우리가 할 수 있는 한 최대한도로 밀물의 힘을 적게 받기 위해 강가 기슭 바로 아래로 가 위치를 유지하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000썰물 때 가끔 배를 조류에 맡겨 몬 덕분에 우리의 ‘노 꾼’(허버트와 스타톱. 노 젓는 친구들)들이 아직 팔팔 했기 때문에 15분간의 휴식으로도 우리가 원한 에너지를 몽땅 충당할 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000우리는 다소 미끌미끌 거리는 돌들 사이로 상륙해 가지고 온 것을 먹고 마시며 주변을  둘러보았다.\\n\\u3000이건 마치 우리 고향 마을의 늪지대와 흡사한 광경이었다. 희미한 수평선 한 자락을 가지고 있을 뿐 평평하고 단조로운 늪지대 말이다.\\n\\u3000이러는 사이에도, 굽이치고 있던 강물은 돌고 돌아, 강 위에 떠 있던 거대한 ‘부표’(물 위에 띄우는 항로 표지)들을 돌리고 또 돌리고 있었 으며, 그 밖의 다른 것들도 자기 위치에서 오고가도 못하고 쥐죽은 듯 가만히 제 위치를 지키고  있었다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 방금 막 마지막 선단(배의 무리들)이 우리가 향했던 마지막 최저점(높이가 낮은 지점)을 한 바퀴 돈 데다, 갈색 돛을 달고 있던 마지막 녹색 바지선이 밀짚을 잔뜩 싣고 뒤따랐기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000어린아이가 생전 처음 작은 배를 그려본 것처럼 생긴, 바닥짐을 실은 ‘거룻배들’이 진창(질퍽질퍽한 곳)에 낮게 자리하고 있었고,\\n\\u3000강 위로 드러난 말뚝들 위엔 작고 웅크린 ‘여울목’(=물살이 센  곳) 등대 하나가 받침대들과 버팀목들 위에서 절○발이가 된 체 진창에 빠져 있었으며,\\n진흙투성이의 경계표지말뚝들은 진흙에서 쑥 삐져나와 있었으며, 끈적끈적해 보이는 돌들일랑은 진창에서 아예 막 불쑥불쑥 튀어나와\\n있었고,\\n\\u3000빨간색 ‘경계표’(육상표지 경계표)들과 썰물과 밀물의 높이 차이를 표시하는 ‘조석점’들도 진창에 삐져나와  있었으며, 오래된 ‘부잔교’(물에 뜨는 다리, ‘부잔교’ 이미지 링크 ▶ http://blog.daum.net/_blog/photoImage.do?blogid=0Xj1x&imgurl=htt p://cfile229.uf.daum.net/original/113215504D5B6B4A2FA8AC , 검색 일자 :

얼마만큼은 나아갔다는 말이었다. 왜냐하면 우리 쪽으로 밀려오는 밀물의 세기가 너무도  강했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 허버트와 스타톱(주인공의 친구들)은 잘 견뎌주었고 그들은 해가 질 때까지 노를 젓고, 젓고 또 저었다.\\n\\u3000그때는 강이 우리 배를 살짝 들어 올렸기 때문에 우린 둑(제방) 너머를 볼 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000붉게 물든 태양이  강기슭 낮은 고도 위에 떠 있었다. 해 주위로 한  줄기 자줏빛 아지랑이가 아른거리고 있었는데 빠른 속도로 검게 물들 여지고 있었다.\\n정말 쓸쓸하고 멋대가리 없는 늪이었다.\\n\\u3000둑(제방) 훨씬 멀리에는 땅들이 솟아 불룩하게 언덕들을 이루고 있었다.\\n\\u3000우리와 그 언덕들 사이에는 어떤 불빛의 흔적도 찾을 수 없었다. 다만 우울병에 걸렸을 것 같은 갈매기 한 마리가 우리 앞 여기저기에 날아다닐 뿐이었다.\\n\\u3000밤이 빠르게 드리워지고 있었고, 며칠 전 보름달이었던 달도 일찍 떠오르지 않았기 때문에 우린 배 위에서 약간의 의견교환을 한 후, 사실 의견교환도 아닌 한 두 마디 대화였다, 일단 배에서 내려  찾을 수  있는 첫 번째 외진 여인숙에서 한 숨부터 돌리고 보는 것이 우리의 우선무가 되어야 한다는 결론에 다다랐다.\\n\\u3000그래서 한 번 더 그들은 노를 저었고 나는 집처럼 보이는 것을 찾기  위해 두리번거렸다.\\n\\u3000이런 식으로 우린 거의 아무런 말없이 6킬로미터 내지 8킬로미터를 지루하게  더 견뎠다.\\n\\u3000아주 추운 날씨였다. 그래서 우리 옆을 지나가던 석탄선의 난방기에서 뿜어져 나오는 매연(연기)과 너울거리는 불길이 마치 그 석탄 선을 기분 좋은 집처럼 보이게  했다.\\n\\u3000이때쯤 이미 날은 저물어 암흑 천지였고 이대로 내일 아침까지 갈 것 같았다. 그리고 우리를 비추고 있는 빛들조차 하늘이 아니라 강에서 더 많이 오는 것 같았는데, 그들(허버트와 스타톱)이 노를 살짝 물에 담글 때마다 강물 위에 반사되어 있던 하늘의 몇몇 ‘별들’이 뒤흔들 렸기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000이 음울한(우울한) 시간에 우리는 우리가 뒤쫓기고 있다는 생각에 휩싸였다.\\n\\u3000물결이 밀려옴에 따라 배가 강기슭에 닿아 불규칙한 간격으로 “탁 탁”하며 둔탁한 소리를 내고 있었고, 그런 소리가 들려올 때마다 우리들 중 한 두 명은 분명 놀라며 그 쪽을 흘끗 쳐다보았다.\\n\\u3000강기슭 여기저기에 일련의 조류(썰물과 밀물)의  움직임들로 ‘둑’(제 방) 아래 부분이 마모된 작은 ‘만’(강물이 굽이져 흐르는 곳)이 있었는데 우린 그런 모든 장소를 의심해 초조한 눈빛으로 노려보았다.\\n\\u3000이따금씩 “저 잔물결은 뭐지?”라며 우리들 중 한 사람이 낮은 목소리로 말하려고 치면, 이번엔 또 다른 사람이 “저쪽 저거 보트지?”라며 대꾸했더랬다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음에는 어김없이 죽음과 같은 침묵이 우릴 덮쳤고 그럼 나는 노걸이(노를 꽂는 노걸이)에 걸린 노들이 여느 때와 달리 큰 소리는 낸다고 생각하며 초조하게 앉아  있었다.\\n\\u3000한참 있다가 우린  불현 듯 불빛 하나와  지붕 하나를 보게 되어, 매우 가까운 곳에서 집어 올린 돌들로 만든 것 같은 작은 둑(제방) 길과 나란히 나아갔다.\\n\\u3000나머지 사람들을 배에 그대로 있게 한 후 강기슭을 밟은 나는 술집같은 술집 아닌 여인숙 같은 건물의 창문에서 빛이 새어나오는 것을 목격했다.\\n\\u3000정말 칙칙하고 더러운 장소였다. 감히 말하건대 그런 장소가 밀수업자 패거리들의 단골 아지트(본부)가 아니었다 말할 수 없는 그런 장소 였다.\\n\\u3000하지만 부엌엔 좋은 난방기가 있었고 먹음직스러워 보이는 달걀들이며 불에 그슬린 돼지고기(베이컨)며 들이킬 수 있는 각양각색의 알코 올음료(술)들이  있는 여인숙이었다.\\n\\u3000게다가 “누추하지만,”이라며 여관 주인이 말하긴 했지만 ‘2인용 침대가 1개 있는 방’ 2개가 갖추어져 있는 술집 겸 여인숙이었다.\\n\\u3000여관 주인과, 그의 아내, 그리고 머리가 희끗희끗하게 센 남자 한 명외엔 어떤 다른 일행도 없어보였다. 머리가 희끗희끗하게 센 남성은 우리가 지나쳐왔던 둑길에 소속된 ‘잭’(흔한 이름)이라는 일꾼이었는데 마치 자신의 몸이 강의 수위가 가장 낮을 때를 가리키는 표시인 마냥 너무도 비굴하게 굽실거리고 진흙투성이 옷차림을 한 남성이었다.\\n\\u3000이 일꾼(이름이 ‘잭’. 머리가 희끗희끗 센 사람)의 도움을 받아 나는 배로 다시 되 돌아내려가  사람들을 강기슭으로  오르게 한 다음, 노(젓는 노) 두(2) 개와, 배의 키, 그리고 배의 갈고리 장대와 그 밖의 물품  들을 꺼내 하룻밤을 새기(보내기) 위해 뱃머리를 바람 불어오는 쪽(런 던의 동쪽 바다쪽)으로  돌려놓았다.\\n\\u3000우리 모두는 부엌의 난방기 옆에서  아주 근사한 저녁을 먹었다. 그런 다음 각자의 침대 방을 배당받았다. 허버트(24세)와 스타톱(25세, 주인공의 친구)은 한 방을 쓰고 나(24세, 주인공=어리버리한 영국런던 신사)와 ‘내 피보호자’(59세, 이름이 ‘프로비스’임. 죄수임)가 다른 한  방을 썼다.\\n\\u3000우린 두 방 모두 공기가 외부와 면밀히 차단되어 있는 것을 깨달았는데 마치 바깥 공기가 생명에 치명적인 양 말이다. 두 방의  침대 밑에는 내가 여관주인 가족 소유일 거라 생각한 것보다도 훨씬 더 흙투 성이인 ‘의류들’과 모자 따위를 넣는 ‘판지(단단한 널빤지 같은 종이) 상자들’이 쑤셔 박아져  있었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 우린 우리들이 여하튼 남부럽지 않은 곳에서 휴식을 취하고 있다고 생각했는데 왜냐하면 더 외지고 쓸쓸한 여인숙을 찾을 수가 없었기 때문이었다.\\n\\u3000우리가 저녁식사를 다 마친 후 부엌 옆 난방기 옆에 앉아 편히 쉬는 동안, 방금 말한 그 ‘잭’(65세, 둑길 소속의 일꾼)이라는 사람은 구석에 앉아 있었는데 발에 보기 싫게 부풀어 오른 단화(구두)를 신고서 우리가 달걀들과 베이컨을 씹어재끼는 동안 그 단화(구두)를 우리들에게  뽐내며 자랑했다.\\n\\u3000“이 단화 좀 보쇼, 때깔나지 않소. 며칠 전 물에 빠져 강변으로 밀려 온 어느 선원의 발에서 벗겨낸 거요.”\\n그러더니 내게,\\n\\u3000“보셨소? 밀물 때(오른쪽 바다 쪽에서 왼쪽 런던 쪽으로 가는 강물) 노 4개짜리 갤리선(사람이 노를 젓는 배) 한 척이 런던 쪽으로 올라가는 것 같던데.”라고  물어왔고,\\n그래서 내가,\\n“아뇨 못 봤는데요.”라고 대답하자, 그는,\\n\\u3000“그럼 벌써 내려간 모양이군. 이상도 하지, 여기서 떠날 땐 물살(밀물. 오른 쪽 바다 쪽에서 왼쪽 런던 쪽으로 가는 강물)의 도움을 받으며 노를 젓는 것 같았는데. 아니었나 보군.”\\n\\u3000“그 사람들, 무슨 이유에서인지 아니면 다른 이유가 있어서인지 강을 올라가지 않는 게 더 낫겠다고  생각한  모양이군.”라며  ‘잭’(65세, 둑길 소속의 일꾼)이 말했다. “강을 내려간 걸 봐선 말이지.”\\n\\u3000“노 4개짜리 갤리선(사람이 노를 젓는 배)이라고 말씀하셨죠?”라며 내(24세, 어리버리 한 영국런던 신사)가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그렇소, 4개짜리였소.”라며 잭이 말했다. “노를 젓는 네(4) 사람들 외에도 두 사람이 더 앉아 있더이다.”\\n“그럼  그들이  여기  이  강기슭으로  상륙했었다는  이야기인가요?” “여기 와서 8리터짜리 돌 항아리에다 맥주까지 담아 갔다니까 그러\\n시네. 젠장, 그 술 단지에 확 그냥 독약을 타는 건데. 그러지 못한 게 아쉽군.”라며 “히죽히죽”웃으며 잭이 말했다. “아니면 설사하는  약을 왕창  집어넣든가 말이지.”\\n“대체 왜요?”\\n\\u3000“다 이유가 있다니까 그러네.”라며 잭이 말했다. 그는 질퍽질퍽한 목소리를 내고 있었다. 마치 많은 양의  진흙이 그의 목 안을 적시고 있는 것 같은  목소리였다.\\n\\u3000여관 주인은 병이 있어 보이고 늘 생각에 잠겨 있는 사람 같았다. 그는 또한 창백한 눈빛을 가지고 있었다. 여관 주인은 잭이라는 이 남성에게 몹시도 기대는(의지하는) 것  같았다.\\n여관  주인이 말했다.\\n“저 사람은, 그것이 그들의 진짜 모습이 아닐 거라고 생각하거든요.” \\n“이 사람이 내 감이 맞다니 까 그러네.”라며 잭(65세, 일꾼)이 발언\\n했다.\\n“그럼 그들이 정말 세관에서 나온 사람들 일거라고 생각해요, 잭?”라며 여관 주인이  말했다.\\n“그렇다니까 그러네.”라며 잭이  말했다.\\n“그럼 당신은 틀렸소, 잭.” (←여관 주인의 말)\\n“(과도하게 놀란 표정을 지으며) 내가 틀렸다고!” (←잭의 말) \\n\\u3000자신의 대답에 대한 무한한 중요성 부여와, 자신의  관점에 대한 끝  없는 확신에 찬  ‘잭’(65세, 둑길에서 일하는 일꾼)은 보기 싫도록 부풀어 오른 신발 한 짝을 벗더니 그 신발 안에서 부엌 바닥으로 작은 돌조각 몇 개를 툭툭 털어 떨어뜨리더니 도로 신발을 신었다.\\n\\u3000그는 자기 견해가 옳기 때문에 그와 같은 불필요한 행동도 할 마음의 여유가 있다는 분위기를 풍기며 그렇게 행동했다.\\n\\u3000“아니, 그럼 세관원들이 입는 옷에 딸려 있어야할 단추들을 그 자들이 어떻게 했다는 거요, 이 양반아?”라며  약간  마음이 뒤흔들리는지 여관  주인이 말했다.\\n\\u3000“단추가 뭐 대순가(대수인가)?”라며 잭이 응답했다. “그딴 건 배 밖으로 내팽개치면 누가 찾을 수 있을라고. 아님 삼켜도 되고. 배가 고팠나보지. 생야채라도 자라게 땅에 심어도 되지 않나. 단추 따윈 더 말할 필요가  없다는 거야!”\\n\\u3000“제발 좀 건방 좀 떨지 마쇼, 이 양반아.”라며 여관 주인이 이의를 제기했다. 그 말투엔 자신의 체질적 우울함과 애처로운 애수가 담겨 있었다.\\n\\u3000(잭이라는 일꾼이 여인숙 주인에게 하는 막말입니다→) “그 놈들이 세관에서 나온 경관들이라면 자기 ‘단추’쯤은 어떻게  처리해야 할지 알게 아닌가.” ‘잭’(65세, 머리가 희끗희끗 센 일꾼)은 경관들의 단추를 지독히도 경멸한다는 듯이 ‘단추’라는 단어를 밉살스럽게도 반복했다. “바보들이 아니고서야 자신들의 제복 단추가 사람들 눈에 띄게  하진  않을 거 아닌가. 강바닥에 무슨 놈의 세관원이 있지 않고서야 노잡이 4명에다가 착석자 2명까지 태운 배가 썰물을 타고 올라갔다 밀물을  타고 내려오고 또 썰물 때 내려오고 밀물 때 올라가기를 반복하며 강 주변을 맴돌리 없어! 이 인간아 생각 좀 하고 살아라. 에라.”\\n\\u3000이 말을 하면서  ‘잭’(65세, 머리가 희끗희끗 센  일꾼)은 여인숙 주인을 막 업신여기며 밖으로 나가 버렸다.\\n\\u3000그리고 대화에 응할 사람이 아무도 없었기 때문에 여인숙 주인은 그 주제(세관에서 나온 경관들이 탄 배의 강 맴돌기)를 더 파헤치는 것이 불가능함을  알게 되었다.\\n\\u3000그들의 대화내용(세관에서 나온  경관들이  강을  배회하더라는 대화)이 우리를 불안하게 만들었음은 두 말할 나이도 없었다. 특히, 나는 더 불안했다.\\n\\u3000불길한 바람이 여인숙 둘레로 “윙윙” 낮게 울리었고 밀물이 강기슭에서 “찰싹찰싹” 소리를 내고 있는 가운데, 나는 우리가 감금당해 위 협받고 있다는 느낌을 지울 수가 없었다.\\n\\u3000이런 경고를 주목하는 것에 관해서라면 그토록 유별난 방식으로 강을 배회한 ‘노 4개짜리 갤리선’(사람이 노를 젓는 배)의 존재는 내가 간과할 수 없는 위험한  사실이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 우선 프로비스(59세, 죄수)보고 위층에 가서 “주무시라”라 설득한 다음 내 두 동료(허버트와 스타톱)와 여인숙 밖으로 나가 회의를 가졌다.\\n\\u3000이때쯤에는 스타톱(25세, 주인공과 런던신사교육을 같이 받은 동료. 주인공들보다 1살이 많음)도 상황의 심대성에 대해 인지하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000다음 썰물은 대략 내일 오후 1시쯤에 있을 예정이었다. 그래서 우린 다음 썰물(왼쪽에 있는 런던에서 오른쪽에 있는 바다 쪽으로 템스 강의 강물이 이동하는 때)  때까지 이곳에 머무를지 아님 지금 떠날지 아님 일단은 내일 아침까지 기다렸다가 내일 아침 일찍 떠날지 서로의 의견을 들어보았다.\\n\\u3000전반적으로, 우린 지금 우리가 있는 이곳에서 일단 하루 밤 묵는 것이 더 나은 방책이라는 결론에 다다랐다.\\n\\u3000증기선(독일 최대의 항구도시인 ‘함부르크’로 가는 증기선을 말함)이 오는 시간 한 시간 전쯤까지 여기서 머무르고 있다가 배가 가는 항로로 들어서 썰물에 배를 맡기며 떠내려가고 있는 것이 낫겠다는 결론이었다.\\n\\u3000이런 행동방침을 정한 후, 우린 다시 여인숙 안으로 들어가 각자 배당받은 침대로 가 취침에 들었다.\\n\\u3000나는 의복을 거의 그대로 착용한 채로 자리에 누워 몇 시간 동안 잘 잤다.\\n\\u3000잠에서 깨어보니 바람은 더 거세져 있었고, “승무원”이라고 적힌, 여인숙의 ‘간판’은 바람에 날려 “삐걱삐걱” 소리를 내며 움직이고 있었고 여기저기를 “탕탕”거리며 때려대고 있었다. 그 소리들에 놀라 내가 잠 에서 깬 것  같았다.\\n\\u3000소리를 내지 않으려고 조심하며 침대에서 일어났다. 왜냐하면 내 피 보호자(이름이 ‘프로비스.’ 59세. 죄수)가 아직 단잠에 빠져 있었기 때문이다.\\n나는 창가로 가 밖을  내다보았다.\\n\\u3000어제저녁에 바람이 불어오는 방향 쪽(=동쪽=오른쪽)으로 뱃머리를 돌려놓았던 우리 보트가 있는 둑길이 내려다보였다. 구름에 덮인 달빛에 내 눈이 점점 익숙해지면서 나는 두 남성이 우리 배 속을 들여다보는 것을 보았다.\\n\\u3000그 두 남성은 내가 있는 창 바로 아래를 지나쳐갔는데 배외에는 어떤 다른 것도 살펴보지 않는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000그들은 선착장(=부두=배 타는 곳) 쪽으로 내려가진  않았는데  내가 봐도 선착장은 텅 비워 있었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그들은 늪지대를 가로질러 건너가 ‘노어’(=템스 강 끝자락에 있던 모래언덕. 즉 ‘북해’ 바다가 템스 강과 처음 만나는 강어귀<첫머 리>에 있는 모래언덕을 말한다고 함. 어쨌든 템스 강이 완전히 끝나는 영국 땅 오른쪽 끝을 말함. 구글 검색에만 나오고 구글 지도에는 안    나옴. 그 사이에 건물 짓느라고 사라졌나봄????? 아닌가???? 여하튼  영국 오른쪽 끝은 맞음) 쪽 방향으로 갔다.\\n\\n#1. 네이버 해외 지도 첨부 (the Nore로 검색 후 임의로 장소 지정)

후면)에 있던, 그의 방 안으로 들어가기 전에 막상 허버트와 스타톱이 어제 하루 나 보다 훨씬 더 고단한 하루를 보냈고 피곤에 겨워 있을 거란 생각에 다다른 나는, 그를 깨우려던 것을 그만 두었다.\\n\\u3000내 방 창가로 돌아온 나는 그 두 남성이 늪지대로 나아가고 있는 것을 볼 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이런 달빛 아래에서 내 시선은 곧 그들을 놓쳤고 게다가 갑자기 세찬 추위까지 느껴져 나는 그 문제와 더 싸우지 않고 항복한 후  도로 자리에 누워 잠을 청했다(잠이 들었다).\\n\\u3000우리는  아침 일찍  일어났다. 네 명이서 다 함께 왔다 갔다 하며 아침 식사시간 전까지 걷는 동안 나는 내가 어제 밤에 봄 광경을 그들에게 자세히 말해주는 것이 옳겠다는 생각이

위해 막 움직여보기도 하면서 시간을 보냈다.\\n\\u3000그들이 왔을 때 우린 쉽게 보트에 탔고 증기선이 지나갈 항로(길)로 들어서기 위해 우린 노를 저었다.\\n\\u3000‘오후 1시를 10분 정도 남겼을 무릎’(오후 12시 50분부터)부터는 우리도 증기선이 내뿜는 연기를 찾기 시작했다.\\n\\u3000하지만, 오후 1시 30분이 지나고서야  우린  증기선이 내뿜는 연기를  볼 수 있었고, 곧이어 또 다른 증기선이 그 뒤에서 연기를 내뿜으며 다가오는  모습이 보였다.\\n\\u3000전속력으로 그 두 증기선들이 다가오는 동안, 우린 두(2)개의 가방을 챙기며 허버트(24세, 주인공의 친구)와 스타톱(25세, 주인공의 학교동료)에게 “잘 있어.”라며 작별 인사를 했다.\\n\\u3000우리들은 진심으로 뜨거운 악수를 나누었고, 허버트의 눈에서도 내 눈에서도 눈물이 멈추질  않았다.\\n\\u3000바로 그때 우리 조금 앞에 위치한 ‘둑’(제방) 아래에서 ‘노 4개짜리 갤리선(사람이 노를 젓는 배)’이 불쑥하고 튀어나오더니 우리와 동일한 항로 속으로 노를 저어 다가오는 것이 보였다.\\n\\u3000그 근처 템스 강이 휘어있고 구불구불했기 때문에 아직까지 ‘우리’와 ‘증기선의 연기’ 사이에는 쭉 뻑은 강기슭(=해안가)이 하나 더 놓여 있었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이제 증기선은 명백히 눈에 보였고 우리를 향해 전진하고 있었다.\\n나는 허버트(24세, 친구)와 스타톱(25세,  동료)에게,\\n\\u3000“우리가 그들을 기다리며 잠시 정지해 있다는 것을 저쪽 증기선들에서도 알 수 있게 노를 젓지 말고 썰물에 맡기고 있어.”\\n라고 요구했다.\\n\\u3000그리고 프로비스(59세, 죄수)에게는 “소리 내지 마시고 앉아 계시기만 하면 되요.”라고 말한 후 그의 장교용 망토(외투)로 그를 덮어주었다.\\n\\u3000프로비스는 “염려 말아라, 얘야.”라며 명량하게 대답하더니 조각상처럼  자리에 앉았다.\\n\\u3000내가 이런 조치들을 하는 동안에도, ‘갤리선’(6인승 배, 사람이 노를 젓는 배)은 증기선과 우리 사이를 엑스(X)자 형태로 밀고 들어와 우리 배가 자신들의 배를 따라잡게 만들더니 우리 배가 자신들의 배 옆에 나란히 서게 만들었다. 갤리선은 정말 능숙하게 조종되고 있었다.\\n\\u3000노만 간신히 움직일 수 있을 정도의 공간만을 남겨둔 채, 갤리선은 우리와 나란히 보조를 유지하고  있었는데,  우리가 표류하며(떠내려가면) 그들도 표류하고(떠내려가고) 우리가 노를 한  번 저으면 그들도 노를 한번 내지는 두 번 저었다.\\n\\u3000두 명의 ‘착석 자’들 중 한 사람(키잡이)이 배의 ‘방향타용 줄’(=요크 라인=배의 핸들=오른쪽으로 꺾으면 오른쪽으로 진행, 왼쪽으로 꺾으면\\n\\n\\n왼쪽으로 진행)들을 쥐고 있었는데 우리를 주의

 가까워지고  있었다. 증기선의 페달(큰 바퀴 같이 생긴 거)들이 강 위를 때리며 내는 소 음들이 점점 더 커져가고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 막, 그 증기선의 그림자가 정말로 우리 머리 바로 위까지 다다랐다고 느끼는 순간, 느닷없이 ‘갤리선’(6인승 배)이 느닷없이 우리를 큰 소리로 불렀다.\\n나는 그 이유를  물었다.\\n\\u3000‘방향타용

노를  크게 한 번 앞으로 내저은 후 노를 다시 자신들의 배 안으로 끌어올렸는데 이리하여 그들의 배는 우리 배를 비스듬히 앞질렀고 그 결과 그들은 자신들의 뱃머리를 우리 배의 앞쪽 위에 올려놓을 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000이 모든 일은 우리가 미처 그들의 의도를 눈치 채기도 전에 이루어졌고, 이 느닷없는 상황연출이 (함부르크 행) 증기선 갑판 위에 있던 선원들에게 큰 혼란을 불러일으켰고 그래서 그들은 우리 쪽을 향해 “뭐라고! 뭐라고!” 소리치고 있었고, 그들 중 누군가는 다급하게 선실 쪽을 향해 “당장 패달(바퀴) 멈춰!”라고 외치는가 싶더니 이내 패달이 멈췄지만 증기선은 지금까지의 추진력을 이기지 못하고 계속해서 우리 쪽을 향해 전진해오고  있었다.\\n\\u3000그와 동시에, 나는 그 갤리선(사복경찰의 배)의 키잡이(=선장=사복경찰)가 자기 죄수(59세, 프로비스=죄수)의 어깨 위에 손을 얹는 것을 보았으며, 썰물(강물)의 힘에 의해 우리 두 배가 빙글 돌고 있는 것을 느꼈으며, 우리를 향해 돌진해오고 있는 증기선의 갑판 위에 있던 선 원들이 죄다 미친 듯 앞으로 뛰어나오고 있는 것을 보았다.\\n\\u3000그와 동시에, 나는 죄수(59세, 프로비스)가 펄쩍 뛰어 올라 자신을 낚아채려는 자(=갤리선의 키잡이=경찰) 너머로 몸을 휙 구부리더니 잔뜩 웅크린 채 갤리선(경찰의 배)에 앉아 있던 자의 목덜미에서 외투를 확 끌어당기는 것을  보았다.\\n\\u3000그와 동시에, 나는 외투가 벗겨진  그자의 얼굴을 보았으며 그  얼굴은 놀랍게도 내가 어릴 적에 늪지대에서 보았던 또 다른 죄수의 얼굴이었다. (주인공은 어릴 적에 2명의 죄수를 보았습니다. 첫 번째 죄수는 다혈질의 ‘프로비스’입니다. 두 번째 죄수는 사기꾼 ‘콤피슨’입니다. 이것이 이 소설의 시작이자 끝입니다.)\\n\\u3000그와 동시에, 나는 내가 앞으로도 절대 잊을 수 없을 공포심에 질려 얼굴이 창백하게 일그러져가는 그의 얼굴을 보았으며 곧이어 증기선의 갑판 위에서 내지르는 어떤 함성(외침) 소리가 들리는가 싶더니 곧 물 속에 “첨벙”하고 뛰어드는 큰 소리를 들었으며 그리고 배가 내 발 아 래에서부터 낮아지고 있는 것을  느꼈다.\\n\\u3000순간 나는 천(1000)개의 ‘물레방아 바퀴들’과 천(1000)개의 ‘섬광’ (번쩍거리는 빛)들과 있는 힘을 다해 싸운 느낌이었다. 즉각 나는 갤리선 위로 끌어올려졌다. 허버트(24세, 주인공의 절친)가 거기 있었고, 그리고 스타톱(25세, 주인공과 같은 신사교육 선생님에게서 배운  동료)도 그 배에 타고 있었다. 하지만 우리 배는 이미 사라지고 난 후였다. 또한 두(2) 명의 죄수들 또한 보이지 않았다.\\n\\u3000‘함부르크(독일 항구) 행’ 증기선의 갑판 위에 있던 선원들의 외침소리 때문에, 그리고 계속해서 나아가고 있는  증기선과  그  증기선에서 미친 듯이 분출되고 있던 증기(연기) 때문에, 그리고 우리 배가 계속해서 떠밀리고 있었기 때문에, 나는 처음에 어디가 강기슭이고 어디부터가 하늘이고 어디까지가 강인지를 분간할 수가 없었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 갤리선(사복경찰들의 배)의 선원들은 엄청난 스피드로 배(갤 리선)의 위치를 바로 잡았다. 그들은 정확하고 날 세게 있는 힘껏 노를 앞으로 끌어당기고 나서 노를 거둬 다시 배 위에 올려놓은 후 합심해 모두들 배 뒤쪽을 말없이 그리고 열심히 살펴보고 있었다.\\n\\u3000이내 거무스름한 무언가가 그들의 시야에 들어왔고 그것은 썰물에 떠밀러 우리 쪽(=갤리선=사복경찰 배)을 향해 다가오고 있었다.\\n모두들 아무런 말이  없었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 ‘키잡이’(=갤리선의 키잡이=선장=경찰)가 자신의 손을 들어 신호를 보내자 모든 선원들이 부드럽게 배를 뒤로 저었으며 그래서 배는 직선으로 후진해 정확하게 그 검은 물체 쪽으로 다가갔다.\\n\\u3000점점 가까워짐에 따라, 나는 그 물체가 ‘매그위치’(59세, 죄수의 진짜 이름. 죄수의 가명은 ‘프로비스’임)가 수영해오고 있는 것임을 알아 차렸다. 하지만 그건 자유로이 놀리고 있는 수영자세는 아니었다. 어딘가 불편해보였다.\\n\\u3000선원들(사복경찰들)은 매그위치(59세, 죄수의 진짜 이름)를 배 위로 끌어올린 다음 그 즉시 매그위치의 두 손목과 두 발목에 수갑을 채웠다.\\n\\n\\u3000▼ 주인공 현재 위치(사복경찰들이 탄 갤리선의 사건 당시 현재 위 치)(영국 템스 강 하류와 북해 바다가 처음으로 만나는 강)\\n[네이버 지도. 검색어 : the Nore ] 링크 추가 못함\\n▼ 함부르크 (독일  항구도시)  위치 [네이버 지도 첨부. 검색어 : 함부르크 ] 링크 추가 못함\\n▼ 로테르담 (네덜란드 항구도시) 위치 [네이버 지도. 검색어 : 로테르담 ] 링크 추가 못함\\n\\n\\u3000갤리선(사복경찰의 배)은 현 위치를 유지한 채 조용히 그리고 열심히 강물 위 수색을  계속했다.\\n\\u3000하지만 이젠 ‘로테르담’(네덜란드 항구도시) 행 증기선이 접근하고 있었다. 그 증기선은 방금 전 상황(난파)에 대해 전혀 모르는 듯 급속  도로  전진하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000증기선이 이쪽에서 소리쳐 부르는 소리를 듣고서 배를 가까스로 멈추었을 때쯤에는 두 증기선(함부르크 행 증기선과 로테르담 행 증기선. 함부르크=독일 항구도시. 로테르담=네덜란드 항구도시) 모두 우리로부터 훨씬 멀어진  뒤였다.\\n\\u3000우리가 탄 갤리선(사복경찰의  배)은  두  증기선이  지나가며  남기고 간 거친 물살의 결과 강 위로 들어 올려 졌다가 내려졌다가를 반복하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000우리가 두 번째로 강 수색에 들어간 한참 뒤 그리고 두 증기선이 완전히  사라지고 난  뒤,  우리  모두는  강 수색은 계속하고  있었지만 그것이 가망 없는 일임을 잘 알고 있었다. \\n\\n▼ 이름이 ‘승무원’인 여인숙의 위치 (주인공의 현재 위치) [네이버 해외지도 첨부. 검색어 : the Nore ] 링크 첨부 못함\\n\\n\\u3000결국 우린 수색을 포기했다. 갤리선(사복경찰의 배)의 선원들(사복경 찰들)은 어제 묵었던 여인숙(여인숙 이름이 ‘승무원’임)이 있는 쪽으로 강기슭을 따라 노를  저어나갔다.\\n여인숙에 있던 사람들은 ‘적잖이’(아주 많이) 놀라며 우리를 맞았다. 그곳에서  나는  ‘매그위치’(59세,  죄수의  진짜이름)를  위해  몇  가지\\n편안한 조치를 취할 수  있었다.\\n‘프로비스’(매그위치의 가명)라는 가명은 더 이상 용인되지 않았다. 매그위치는  가슴패기(가슴의  평평한  부분) 안에 위중한(심각한) 상처\\n를 몇 군데나 입은 상태였으며 머리에도 깊게 베인 상처가 하나 난 상태였다.\\n매그위치(59세,  죄수)가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“이런 젠장 아무래도 증기선(배)의 ‘용골’(배 바닥에서 가장 아래로 볼록한 부분) 밑까지 내려갔다 온 것 같군. 다시 떠오르는 과정에서 용골(볼록한 부분)에 머리를 세차게 부딪친 건 말할 것도 없고. 가슴에   입은 상처는 물속에 빠지는 과정에서 갤리선(사복경찰의 배) 옆쪽에 부딪쳐  입은 상처란다.”\\n\\u3000그는 가슴에 난 상처로 말미암아 숨을 쉴 때마다 극심한 고통을 받고 있었다.\\n매그위치가 덧붙였다(말했다).\\n\\u3000“콤피슨(63세, 옥스퍼드 대학 출신의 철저한 사기꾼. 매그위치에게 사기를 쳐 감옥에 넣은 사람) 그 자식에게 내가 뭔 짓을  했을지 안했  을지 입에 담고 싶지 않다. 하지만 그 자식에게서 망토(외투)를 벗겨내는 순간 난 그게 그 새끼라는 걸 알았지. 그랬더니 그 자식이 나를 보곤 깜짝 놀라 일어나더니 휘청거리며 뒤로 물러서지 않겠어. 그 바람에 우리 둘 다 배 밖으로 꼴아 떨어진 게다.”\\n\\u3000매그위치가 그런 식으로 갑자기 우리 배를 벗어나며 몸을 비틀었을 때, 매그위치를 체포하려든  키잡이(=선장=사복경찰)도  또한  매그위치를 계속 배 안에 두려고 붙잡고 있으려다 보니 우리 배가 뒤집힌 것이었다.\\n매그위치가 소곤거리며 내게  말했다.\\n\\u3000“우린 서로의 팔 안에 지독하게 붙들린 채 물에 처박혔지. 물 아래에서 한 차례의 싸움이 있은 후 내가 그 놈의 팔을 풀고 헤엄쳐 나온 경우란다.”\\n\\u3000그(59세, 매그위치=죄수)가 이렇게 말한 것에 대해서 그 정확한 진 의여부를 내가 의심할 어떠한 이유도 없었다.\\n\\u3000갤리선(사건 당시 사복경찰들이 탔던 배)의 키를 잡았었던(운전했던)  그 경찰관도 또한 매그위치(59세, 죄수)와 콤피슨(63세, 사기꾼이자 밀고자)이 배 밖으로 떨어진 이유를 같은 식으로 설명했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000나는 그 경찰관(앞서의 키잡이)에게 “아저씨의 젖은 옷들을 다른 걸로 바꿔 입혀드려도 될까요?

(원문에는 “진실하다”가 아니라 “충실하다”라고 적혀 있음. 충실하다... 잘 안 쓰는 단어라 진실로 바꿈. 100% 맘대로  해석 :) ㅎㅎ  )\\n내 손을 쥐고 있던 그의 손이 떨리는 것이 느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000갤리선(배)의 바닥에 누워 있는 동안 그는 고개를 옆으로 돌렸고, 나는 그의 목에서 나는 익숙한 소리(철 조각이 부딪치는 소리)를 들었다. 지금은 그 소리도 부드러워졌다, 마치 그의 나머지 부분들처럼.\\n\\u3000그(59세, 매그위치=죄수)가 이 점을 언급한 것은 어찌 보면 다행이었다. 만약 그렇지 않았다면 내가 너무 늦어서야 생각해 냈을 것들을 마음먹게  해주었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000‘나를 부유한 신사로 만들려던 그의 희망들이 이렇게 해서 최후를 고하게 되었음을 굳이 그가 알고 있을 필요는 전혀 없어.’라는 생각 말이다.\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 55장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000다음 날 매그위치(59세, 죄수)는 ‘즉결 심판소(즉결 법원)’로 이송되었다. 보통 같으면 즉시 재판이 시작되었겠지만, 이번 경우 그의 신원을 확인해줄 사람을 필요했기 때문에 그가 한 차례 탈옥했었던 감옥선 (배)에 사람을 보내 나이 많은 감독관(경찰관)을 불러들이는 데 시간이 다소  필요했던 것이다.\\n\\u3000아무도 그의 신원을 의심하지 않았다. 하지만 그것을 증언해주기로  되어 있었던 콤피슨(63세, 옥스퍼드 대학 출신의 철저한 사기꾼)이 죽어 템스 강의 조수(썰물과 밀물)들에 짓밟히고 있는 데다 절차상 필요한 증언을 해줄 수 있는 교도관들이 때마침 런던시내에 아무도 없는 경우가  발생했던 것이다.\\n\\u3000전날 밤에 런던으로 돌아오자마자 나는 그의 자택으로 ‘재거스 씨’(51세, 유명한 변호사)를 곧바로 찾아갔다. 그와의 관계를 유지하기 위해서였다.\\n\\u3000일단 재거스 씨는 죄수(매그위치)를 대신해서 그 어떤 것도 시인하지 않기로 했다. 그것이 유일한 방책이었기 때문이다. 왜냐하면 재거스 씨의 말에 의하면, 증인이 있을 시 이번 사안은 단지 5분이면 끝장날 사안이었기 때문이며 그리되면 지구상에 있는 그 어떤 유력자(권력자)도 이번 재판이 우리 쪽에게 불리하게 진행되는 것을 막아줄 수 없을 것이기 때문이었다.\\n\\u3000자신의 재산이 몰수되리란 것을 그(59세, 매그위치=죄수)가 계속 몰랐으면 좋겠다는 내 생각을 ‘재거스 씨’(51세, 런던에서 가장 유명한 변호사)에게 전했다.\\n재거스 씨는,\\n\\u3000“그것(매그위치의 재산)이 미꾸라지처럼  손가락들  사이로  빠져나가는  것을 내버려두었다.”\\n며 불평 아닌 분노를 터뜨렸다. 그리곤 그는,\\n\\u3000“(재거스 씨의 대사→) 우린 곧 청원서를 제출해 그 중 남은 일부라도 돌려받을 수 있도록 여하튼 시도해보아야 하네.”\\n라고 덧붙였다.\\n\\u3000하지만 재거스 씨는 속내를 숨기지는 않았는데 이렇게 말했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“아무리 재산이 몰수 되지 않는 소송사건들이 많다손 치더라도 이번 사안의 정황 상 그리 될 가능성은 전혀 없다네.”\\n\\u3000나도 그 점을 십분(충분히) 이해하고 있었다. 하지만 나는 범법자와 연관되어 있지도 않았고 그렇다고 남이 알아볼 정도로 그와 어떤 유대로  묶여있지도 않았다.\\n\\u3000그(매그위치)는 체포되기 전에 나를 위해 서류나 재산 양도에 서명한 적도 전혀  없었다.\\n\\u3000그런데 이제 와서 재산을 받겠다고 시도하는 것은 정말 어리석은 짓이었다.\\n\\u3000무엇보다 나는 그의 재산에 대한 어떠한 법적 권리도 없었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000그래서 나는 그의 재산에 대한 나의 권리를 법적으로 입증시켜보겠다는 무익한 일로 내 마음을 구역질나게 하지 않기로 결심했다. 그리고 그 후로 계속 그 결심을 지켰다.\\n\\n\\u3000(참조 : 동서양을 망라하고 밀고는 대단히 수지맞는 장사였습니다. 밀고자들에게는 범죄자(대개 부자들)의 재산 1/4이 돌아갔기 때문입니다. 특히나 왕이 지배하는 국가에선 밀고란 앞뒤 정황만 일치하면 범죄가 실제 있었는지 없었는지는 중요하지 않죠. 표면에 드러났다는 사실 자체가 중요하니까요. 재산 몰수는 당연. 삐뚤어진 인간 심리의 한 단면입니다. 더하고 뺄 것도 없이 역사책에 수도 없이 등장하는 장면이니까요. 밀고가 수지맞는 장사였다는 것이요. 이상 “인간 본성이 악하다”에 한 표 던지는

수 킬로미터 떨어진 하류에서 콤피슨의 시신이 발견되었을 때 그의 시신의 형체가 심하게 훼손된 상태라 그의 호주머니들 속에 있던 내용물들을 통해서 그의 신원을 간신히 확인할 수 있었는데, 그 호주머니들 속에 있던 서류들은 그나마 여전히 읽을 수 있었기 때문이었다. 그는 그 서류들을 꼬기 꼬기 접어서 호주머니에 넣어가지고 다녔던  것이다.\\n\\u3000그 서류들 사이에는, 비교적 많은 돈이 들어 있는 (은행), ‘뉴 사우스 웨일스’(=오스트레일리아의 남동부 주 = ‘뉴 사우스 웨일스’라는 주의 중심도시가 ‘시드니’임 = 위대한 유산이란 소설 속에서 죄수 매그 위치가 유형 생활을 하다 막대한 부를 쌓을 수 있었던 장소임)에 있는 어느 은행 이름과, 상당한 가치가 있다고 추정되는 특정 지역들의 이 름들이  적혀 있었더랬다.\\n\\u3000이들 ‘은행 이름’과 ‘지명’들은, 교도소에 갇혀 있는 동안 매그위치(59세, 죄수)가 내(24세, 주인공의 이름)게 재산을 물러주려 한다며 그가 헤아려 재거스 씨(51세, 변호사)에게 건네준 자신의 재산 목록 표에  적혀 있었더랬다.\\n\\u3000가엾은 사람, 어쩌면 모르는 것이 상책이었을지 모른다. 그는 만약 재거스 씨(51세, 런던에서 가장 유명한  변호사)의 도움만  있다면 자신의 재산이 아주 그러니까 아주 안전할 거라 믿어 의심치 않았던 것이다.\\n\\u3000죄수의 신원을 확인해줄 감독관(증인)을 지방(주인공 시골고향 인근 강)에 있던 감옥 선에서 불러올 목적으로 검찰 측에서 연기한 3일이 지난 후, 감독관(증인)이 도착했고 이 손쉬운 소송의 구비요건은 모두 갖추어졌다.\\n\\u3000매그위치(59세, 죄수)는 한 달 후에 열릴 다음 ‘법정 개정 기간’  때  맞춰 재판을 받기 위해  수용되었다(감금되었다).\\n\\u3000어느 날 저녁 집으로 돌아온 허버트(24세, 주인공의 절친)가 완전히 의기소침해져서는 다음과 같이 말했을 때가 그러니까 내 삶에 전혀 빛이  없을 시기였다.\\n\\u3000“어쩌니 ‘헨델’(주인공의 애칭=별명),  아무래도  곧  너를  떠나게될 것 같아.”\\n\\u3000이미 그의 사업 파트너가 내게 귀 뜸을 해준 사안이었기 때문에 나는 그가 예상한 것보다 덜 놀랬다.\\n\\u3000(허버트의 대사→)  “이번에 ‘카이로’(이집트의 수도)로 가는걸 미루면 더할 나위 없는 기회를 놓치고 말 거야. 네게 내 도움이 가장 필요로 할

그러지.”\\n\\u3000(주인공의 대사→) “난 지금 그런 생각할 여유도 없는 걸.”라며 내가 말했다. “너도 알잖니. 시간이 허락하는 한은(최대한은) 내가 그와 함께 머무르는 걸, 그리고 가능만 하다면 온종일이라도 나는 그의 옆에 있어줘야 한다는 걸 말이야. 집에 와서도 내 생각은 그에게서 떠나질 않는다는 걸 너도 잘

정직한 손을 뻗어 보이는 그의 태도 속에는 애교 섞인 정중함과 남을 설득하는  무언가가 있었다.\\n\\u3000(허버트가 주인공에게 하는 대사→) “클라라(21세, 허버트의 약혼녀)와 난(24세, 허버트=주인공의 절친) 이 문제에 대해 몇 번이고 대화를 나눠보았단다.”\\n허버트(주인공의 절친)가 계속해서 말을 이어갔다.\\n\\u3000(허버트가 주인공에게 하는 대사→) “그 어리고 귀여운 것은 오늘 저녁까지만 해도 두 눈에 눈물을 머금고서(눈물 가득) 신신당부를 하지 않겠니. 네(24세, 파산 직전이자 신경쇠약 증상을 보이기 시작하려는 ‘주인공=영국신사’)게 가 ‘우리들과 함께 그곳(카이로=이집트 수도)으로 가 살자’고 제발 말해달라고 말이야. 만약 너만 승낙해준다면 네(주인공) 행복을 위해

나는 아직도 그들과 함께해도 좋을지 확신이 서지 않았다. 마치 녀석이 친절하게 제안을 하는 만큼이나 망설였다.\\n\\u3000이미 내 마음은 다른 주제에 몰두하고 또 골몰해 있었기 때문에 카이로 지점으로 가는 일까지 담을 마음의 여력이 없었다.\\n\\u3000다음으로… 그래! 그 다음으로 말이다.(카이로로 가려는 결정을 쉽게 내리지 못하는 이유의 두 번째 이유는) 내 생각 속에서 미련을 느끼고 망설이려는 분명치 않은 무엇인가가 있었다는 것이다. 그땐 몰랐다. 하지만 내 비천한(엉성한) 이야기의 끝 부분에 거의 다다라서는 그것이 무엇인지  드러날 것이다.\\n\\u3000“하지만 허버트, 만약 네가 네 비즈니스에 어떤 영향(손해)도 끼치지 않는 선에서 그 문제를 잠시 유보해줄 수 있다면….”\\n\\u3000“얼마든지,”라며 허버트가 소리쳤다. “6개월이 되었든,  1년이 되었든 네 답을 기다리고  있을게!”\\n\\u3000“하지만 그리 오래 걸리진 않을 거야.”라며 내가 말했다. “기껏 2~3 개월이면 답을 줄 수 있을 것 같아.”\\n\\u3000이런 합의를 도출하고 우리가 악수를 나누었을 때 허버트는 뛸 듯이 기뻐했고 그래서 때마침 결단을 내릴 수 있었는지 나에게 다음과 같이 말했다.\\n“아무래도 이번 주말에 출국해야 될 것 같았거든.” “클라라도?”라며  내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그 어리고 귀여운 것에겐 보살펴드려야 될 아버님이 계시잖니. 하지만 그 분도 그리 오래 버티시진(사시진) 못하실 거니까. 윔플 부인(41세, 클라라의 하숙집 주인)이 내게만 말해준건데, 아무래도 오래 못 가실  것 같데.”\\n\\u3000“무정하게 들릴는지는 몰라도,”라며 내가 말했다. “본인을 위해서도 돌아가시는 게 제일 나을 거야.”(클라라의 아버지가 몹시 아파서 하는 말임. 클라라의 아버지는 선원이었는데 일을 그만두고 술에 빠져 그만 안타깝게 된 경우임. 술 조심~ 도박 조심~ 조심할 게 많음 :( 조심~)\\n\\u3000“그 말을 인정할 수밖엔 없다는 것이 안타까울 뿐이지.”라며 허버트가 말했다. “어쨌든 돌아가시고 나면 난 깜찍이를 데리러 귀국하게 될 것이고 그럼 나와 그녀는 가장 가까운 교회 안으로 스리슬쩍 스며들어갈 생각이란다. 생각해봐! 축복받은 신부는 어떤 명문가문 출신도 아니  란 것을, 안 그러니 헨델(주인공의 애칭=별명), 그 애는 『귀족 신사록 』 (귀족과

허버트가 출발했다는 소식을 알리기 위해서였다. 그리고 메모 하단에는 허버트가 내게 “그녀에게 사랑한다고 전해줘”라고 되풀이해 말했었다는 내용도  적었다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 나는 홀로 집으로  귀가했다, 만약  그것이 집이라는  호칭을 받을 만한 가치가 있다면….\\n\\u3000그곳은 더 이상 내게 집이 아니었다. 세상 어디에도 나를 위한 집은 없었다.\\n\\u3000(내 숙소 건물 내부) 계단에서 나는 웨믹과 마주쳤다. 그는 (내) 숙소 문을 두드린 자신의 손가락 관절들이 실패를 거둔 후 내려가던 중이었다.\\n\\u3000밀항 시도가 처참하게 실패한 후 내가 그를 처음 만나는 자리이기도 했다.\\n\\u3000그는 사적이고 개인적인 자격으로 나를 찾아온 것이며 이번 실패와 관련해 몇 마디 해명(변명)을 하려던 참이었다.\\n\\u3000“죽은 ‘콤피슨’(옥스퍼드 대학  출신의  철저한  사기꾼이름)이,” 웨믹이 말을 꺼냈다. “지금까지 실행된 ‘일반 비즈니스’(주인공들이 독일 항구도시로 밀항하는 것)의 깊은 속내까지 조금씩 염탐해왔던가 봅니다. 제가 그 얘기를 들은 것은 곤경에 빠져 있는, 그의 똘마니들 중 몇 몇을 통해서였거든요. 그의 부하들 중 몇몇은 항상 곤경에 빠져 있었 지요. 저는 귀를 닫고 있는 듯 하면서 열어놓고 있었지요. 그때 제가 콤피슨이 런던에 없다는 얘기를 들은 겁니다. 그래서 (밀항을) 시도하기에  가장  최적의  적기라 생각했었죠. 지금 와서  생각해보면, 그것도  그 자의 꾐 중 하나였던 것 같습니다. 대단히 영리한 사람이었습니다. 습관적으로 자신의 똘마니들까지

여기 반지가 있네!”라며 혼자말로 자기 자신에게 말하는 것을 나는  들었다.\\n나는 신랑의 지지자 그러니까 신랑 들러리 역할을 맡았다.\\n\\u3000한편 아기 ‘보닛’(턱 밑으로 끈을 매는,  아기들  모자)을  쓴 몸집이 작고 발을 저는(절뚝거리는) ‘교회의 좌석 안내인’이 ‘미스 스키핀스 양’(43세)의 가장 친한 친구 시늉을 하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000신부를 신랑에게 인도하는 중책은 노인장(웨믹의 아버지)에게 위임 되었다(맡겨졌다). 그런데 이것이 그만 목사님께서 본의 아니게도 발끈하는 계기가 되었는데, 다음과 같이 일이 진행되었기 때문이다.\\n목사님께서,\\n\\u3000“혼례를 치를 수 있도록 이 여인을 누가 이 사내에게로 인도해주시 나요?”\\n라며 노인장에게 말씀드렸을  때,\\n\\u3000노인장(귀가 잘 안 들리심)께서는 자신이 지금 이번 의식의 어느 지 점에 와 계신지 미처 파악하지 못하시고서 ‘십계명’(모세의 십계명)을 향해 가장 온화한 미소를 지으며 서 계셨던 것이다.\\n그러자 목사님께선 다시 한 번 더,\\n\\u3000“어느 분께서 이 여성이 결혼하실 수 있도록 이 사내에게로 인도해 주시죠?”\\n라며 ‘어느 분’이라는 단어를 강조해서 물으셨던 것이다.\\n\\u3000나이 많으신 신사 분(웨믹의 아버지. 귀가 잘 안 들리심)께선 여전히 교회 십계명만 바라보시며 가장 존경할 만한 상념에 젖어계셨더랬다.\\n그래서 신랑(웨믹)이 늘 하던 목소리로,\\n“살짝 연로하신 아버님, 네! 누가 인도하시죠?” 라고 했더랬다.\\n그제야 노인장께선 엄청나게 호탕하게도 이렇게 대답했더랬다.\\n\\u3000“그래 오케이다, 존(웨믹의 이름이 아니라 애칭임. 애칭=사랑해서 부르는 별명) 아, 암 오케이고 말고 내 아들아!”\\n그런데 그는 이 대답을 목사님의 질문에 답하기 전에 했던 것이다. 그래서 목사님께서는 순간 아주 암담한 심정이 되시어 잠시 생각에\\n잠기게 되었는데 잠깐 동안이었지만 나는 그 날 웨믹 씨의 결혼식 행사를 우리가 마무리 지을 수 있을지 없을지 심각하게 의심해보지 않을 수  없었던 것이다.\\n그러나 그 날의 결혼식은 잘 마무리되었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 우리가 막 교회를 나서려고 했을 때, 웨믹(46세, 변호사사무실의 서기)은 ‘성수반’(성당 입구에 놓인 물그릇)에서 뚜껑을 벗기더니 그 안에 자신의 흰색 장갑을 넣었다. 그런 다음 뚜껑으로 다시 성수반 위를 덮었다.\\n\\u3000장래(미래)에 대해 보다 좀 더 배려심이 많은 웨믹 부인(웨믹의 애인이었던 ‘미스 스키핀스 양’=43세)께서는 끼고 있던 흰색 장갑들을 성수반 대신 자신의 호주머니 속에 넣으시곤 녹색 장갑을 꺼내 다시 끼시었다.\\n우리가 밖으로 나왔을 때 웨믹은, “자, 핍 씨.”(핍은 주인공의 이름)\\n\\u3000라며 아주 득의만만한 태도로 낚싯대를 어깨에 메면서 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“한 번 생각일랑 해 보십시오, 누가 이 무리를 결혼식장을 막 나서는  하객들이라 생각하겠습니까.”\\n\\u3000아침식사는 초원(‘캠버 웰 그린’이라는 작은 공원)에서 ‘1~2킬로미 터’(걸어서 15분~30분 거리) 정도 떨어진 언덕 위에 위치한 쾌적하고 자그마한 선술집(가격이 싼 술집)에 이미 주문이 되어놓은 상태였다.\\n\\u3000방에는 핀볼 게임용 탁자도 놓여 있었는데 혹시라도 진지한 결혼식을 막 치르고 난 우리가 긴장을 풀길 바랄 때를 대비한 것이었다.\\n\\u3000웨믹(46세)의 팔이 그녀의 허리를 감싸 앉았을 때 그녀(43세)가 더이상 그의 팔을 풀어헤치지 않고, 마치 케이스 안에 든(들어 있는) 첼 로(사람 키만 한 바이올린) 마냥, 벽에 기대여 있는 ‘등이 높은 의자’에 앉아 선율이 아름다운 악기 늘 그러하듯 웨믹의 팔에 순응하며 받아들이는 모습을 보는 것은 즐거운 일이었다.\\n\\u3000우리는 훌륭한 아침식사를 가졌다. 그리고 우리들 중 어느 누구라도 웨이터가 내어오는 음식들 중 하나라도 거절하려고 하면 웨믹(=신랑= 변호사사무실의 서기, 46세)이  어김없이,\\n\\u3000“지불한(돈 준)대로 나오는 것들입니다. 마다하실 이유가 없어요! 마음껏 드십시오.”\\n라고 말했다.\\n\\u3000나는 “새로운 커플을 위하여!”라며 잔을 들었고(마셨고), 다음으로 “아버님(웨믹의 아버지)을 위하여!”라며 잔을 들었으며(마셨으며) “당신의 성(웨믹의 작은 오두막집)을 위해!”라며 잔을 들었다(마셨다).\\n\\u3000그리고 우리들이 헤어질 때에도 신부에게 깍듯이 거수경계를 해 보이는 등, 내가 할 수 있는 한 기분 좋은 태도를 만들려고 노력했다.\\n웨믹은 나를 선술집 문까지 바래다주었다(계단을 내려왔다).\\n\\u3000나는 다시 한 번 그와  악수를 나누며 “정말 축하드립니다!”라며 그의 기쁨을 빌어드렸다. (주인공은 현재 24세로 경제적으로 파산 직전입니다. 정신적으로도 약간의 신경 쇠약 증세를 보이기 시작하고 있습 니다. 자신을 지지하던 경제적 후원자가 구치소에 갇혀 사경을 헤매고 있거든요.)\\n\\u3000“고맙습니다!” 두 손을 비비며 웨믹(46세, 변호사사무실의 서기)이 말했다. “그녀(43세, 웨믹의 아내)는 가금류(닭, 집오리, 칠면조)를 기르는 데에 있어서도 살림꾼이랍니다. 당신께선 모르셨을 테죠. 나중에 달걀을 몇 개 보내드릴 테니 직접 한 번 판단해보십시오.”\\n\\u3000(주인공이 떠나려하자 웨믹이 주인공을 등 뒤에서 부르며) “있잖습니까, 핍 씨!”(핍=주인공의  이름=24세)\\n등 뒤에서 그가 나를 부르더니 그가 낮은 목소리로 이렇게 말했다. “이번  건(결혼식)은 전적으로  ‘월워스’(웨믹의 집이 있는 동네이름)에\\n서의 감정입니다.

상태는 아주 안 좋았다. 재판을 위해 구치소에 ‘수감된 날’로부터 돌아오는 ‘법정 개정 기간’ 때까지(한 달 동안) 내내 몹시 아파 상태로 그는 자리에 누워 있었다.\\n\\u3000갈비뼈 2개가 부러졌는데 그 부러진 갈비뼈 2개가 그의 허파 두 개 중 하나에 깊은 상처를 낸 것이 문제였다. 그는 호흡을 시도하려 할 때도 아주 고통스러워했고 힘들어했다. 그런 상태는 시간이 갈수록 나아지기는커녕 더 심해지고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그 결과 그는 상대방이 그나마 간신히 들을 수 있을 정도로 작은 목소리로 말해야 했고 따라서 말 수가 무척 적어졌다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그는 언제든 들을 준비가 되어 있었다. 그래서 그가 반드시 들어야 한다고 내가 판단한 것들을 그에게 들려주고 그에게 (책을) 읽어주는 것이 내 삶의 중대한 의무가 되어갔다.\\n\\u3000일반 구치소에 수용되어 있기에는 너무도 그가 아팠기 때문에 그는  첫째 날인가 그 연후에 병원으로 옮겨졌다.\\n\\u3000이로써 나는 그렇지 않았더라면 내가 가질 수 없었을, 그와 함께 있을 수 있는 기회들을 가지게 되었다.\\n\\u3000위중한 그의 병세만 아니었어도 그는 수갑을 차고 지냈을 것이다. 왜냐하면 명백한 탈옥자로 각인되고 있었기 때문이다. 그 밖에도 내가 모르는 어떤 존재로 그는 주변에 인식되고 있었다.\\n\\u3000비록 내가 매일같이 그를 찾아갔다손 치라도 그건 아주 짧은 순간에 불과했다.\\n\\u3000그 결과 우리들이 서로 떨어졌다 정기적으로 다시 만나는 면회시간은 그의 육체 내부에서 발생한 어떤 사소한 변화들조차도 그의 얼굴 위로 드러나게 하기엔 충분히 긴 시간이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 단 한 번도 그의 얼굴에서 어떤 좋은 쪽으로의 변화를 본 기억이 없었다.\\n\\u3000그는 정신적으로나 육체적으로  지쳐있었다. 구치소 문이 그의 위에서 닫힌 그 날(수용당한 날) 이후 그는 매일같이 서서히 약해지고 나 빠지고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그가 보인 순종과 인종(체념)의 종류는 완전히 지친 사람이 보이는 순종과  체념의 일종이었다.\\n\\u3000나는 때때로, 그를 벗어난 속삭이는 한 두 마디의 말들이나 그의 태도에서 자신이 만일 좀 더 좋은 환경 아래에서 태어나 자랐더라면 지금보다 나은 사람이 되진 않았을지 아니었을지 하는 문제를 그가 곰곰이 생각해보고 있다는 어떤 인상을 나는 받았다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그는 절대 그 점을 암시하는 어떤 말로 자신을 정당화하려 하지는 않았다. 또한 영원히 변치 않을 형상을 갖추어버린 자신의 과거에의 기억을 부정하려고도 하지  않았다.\\n\\u3000내가 있는 자리에서 그(=59세=매그위치=프로비스=죄수)의 시중을 드는 사람들 중 한 두(1~2) 사람이 그(죄수)의 끔찍한 평판에 대해 넌 지시 언급한 적이 두 번 또는 세 번 정도 있었다.\\n\\u3000그럴 때면 한 줄기 미소가 그(죄수)의 얼굴 위로 지나갔는데,  그는 내 쪽으로 고개를 돌려 나의 존재가 믿음직스럽다는 듯 쳐다보곤 했다. 마치 내가 어떤 자그마한 속죄(구원)에의 희망을 그의 안에서 보았었음을 확신한다는 마냥, 심지어 내가 너무도 어린 꼬마소년이었을 때 만큼이나 오래전에 내가 그 희망을 보아왔음을 말이다.\\n\\u3000그밖에 나머지 것들에 대해서라면 그는 겸허했고 자신의 죄를 깊이 뉘우치고 있었다. 그리고 절대 불평하는 말을 하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000‘법정 개정 기간’이 다시 돌아왔을 때, ‘재거스  씨’(51세, 런던에서 가장 유명한 변호사)는 매그위치(=59세=프로비스=죄수)의 재판을 다음 ‘법정 개정 기간’(한 달 후)까지 미루어달라는 청원서를 제출했다.\\n\\u3000매그위치가 그보다(1개월) 더 오래 살 수 없을 거라는 확신에서  비롯된 판단이었다. 그리고 그 청원서를 거절되었다.\\n\\u3000재판은 즉시 속개(시작)되었다. 매그위치가 법정 안으로 끌려나왔을  때 사람들은 그를 자리에 앉을 수 있게 했다.\\n\\u3000그리고 내가 피고석 가까이로 다가가 나를 향해 내민 그의 손을 쥐고 있는 것에 대해서도 사람들은 어떤 이의도 제기하지 않았다.\\n재판은 극히 짧았고 보다 분명했다.\\n\\u3000그(=59세=죄수=매그위치)를 변명할 수 있는 말들이  제시되었다. 그가 얼마나 부지런한 습관들을 익혀왔었고 정당하게 돈을 벌어 부유해지고 그곳에서 명성을 얻게  되었는지를.\\n\\u3000하지만 그 어떤 변명도 그(오스트레일리아로 영구 추방된 죄수가 몰래 귀국한 것)가 돌아왔다는 사실과 판사와 배심원들의 면전에(앞에) 존재하고 있다는 사실을 부정할 순 없었다.\\n\\u3000그것에 대한 죄를 물으면서 그 밖에 다른 판결을 내리는 것은 불가능했다. 누가 보더라도 유죄가 확실했던 것이다.\\n\\u3000당시까지만 해도, ‘법정 개정 기간’의 마지막 날에 판결을 일사천리로 통과 시키고 사형선고로써 클로징 효과를 주는 것이 하나의 관습이었다. 그것은 그에 대한 서투른 내 재판 경험을 통해 알게 된 사실이었다.\\n\\u3000아직도 생생하게 남아 있는 지울 수 없는 광경이 아니었더라면, 나는 심지어 이 글을 쓰는 지금조차도, 32명의 남녀 죄수들이 판결을 받기 위해 다 함께 판사 앞에 내몰려져 있는 것을 내가 보았다는 사실을  믿지  못했을 것이다.\\n\\u3000그 32명의 죄수들 맨 앞에 그(매그위치)가 있었다. 그는 의자에 앉아져 있었는데, 그건 그의 생명을 얼마간 유지해줄 만큼의 숨을 그가 내쉴 수 있도록 하기  위해서였다.\\n\\u3000법정의 창문들 위에서 4월의 햇살을 받아 반짝거리고 있던, 봄의 ‘빗방울’들 하나하나에 이르기까지, 모든 광경들이 ‘움직이는’(원문→그 순간의) 생생한 색채가 되어 다시금 떠오르기 시작한다.\\n\\u3000그(59세, 매그위치)가 앉아 있던 피고석의 한 쪽 귀퉁이 바깥쪽에 서서 그의 손을 내 손으로 꼭 쥐고 내가 서 있는 동안,  무대 위에는  32명의 남녀 죄수들이 도열해  있었다.\\n\\u3000어떤 사람들은 무례한 태도로 서 있었고, 어떤 사람들은 공포에 질려 있었으며, 또 어떤 사람들은 흐느껴 울거나 비탄에 잠겨 있었으며,  또 어떤 이들은 두 손으로 자신들의 얼굴을 가린 채 체념한 채 서 있었고, 또 어떤  사람들은  침울한  표정으로  법정  여기저기를  응시하며 서 있었다.\\n\\u3000여성 죄수들 사이에서 날카로운 비명들이 새어나왔지만 곧 가라앉아졌고 “쉿!”(조용히 하라는 신호)이라는 신호는 성공을 거두었다.\\n\\u3000커다란 족쇄(수갑)들과 향기 나는 꽃다발들을 든 ‘집행관’들과, 아무 짝에도 쓸모없는 ‘굴퉁이’(=어중이떠중이들)들과 악한들과, 재판정의 ‘정리’(판사가 판결하면 큰 소리로 읽는 사람)들이며, 관리들이며, 연극을 구경하러 온 엄청난 수의 관객들인 마냥 법정 관객석을 꽉 메우고 있던 사람들 모두가 우릴 구경하며 지켜보는 동안, 32명의 죄수들과 판사는 진지하게 서로를 마주보고 서 있었다.\\n그런 다음 판사가 32명의 남녀 죄수들을 향해 연설을  시작했다. 그(판사)의  앞에  서  있는  이  비참한  피조물들(죄수들)  사이에서도,\\n그(판사)가 특별한 연설을 위해 선발해야 했는 한 사람(=59세=죄수=매그위치)은 유 소년기 때부터 온갖 법에 반하는 범죄자였다.\\n\\u3000그리고 그(=59세=죄수=매그위치)는 감금(감옥)과 처벌을 반복해오다 결국 수년 동안의 감옥선 수감을 선고받았다.\\n\\u3000그리고 그 자는 너무도 과격하고 대담무쌍하게도 감옥 선에서의 탈옥을 감행한 결과 도로 체포당해 종신 유배형(영구 추방)을 선고받은 자였다.\\n\\u3000범죄를 유발할 수 있는 장소(영국)에서 멀리 내보내졌을 때, 이 가련한 피조물은 한 동안 자신의 지나온 잘못들을 누우치는 듯 보였으며 평화롭고 정직한 삶을  살아왔다.\\n\\u3000하지만 결정적인 순간에, 또다시 악행에의 쏠림(범죄성향)과 격정(흥분)에 굴복한 나머지 안식(휴식)과 회개의 피난처(오스트레일리아)를  떠나 그를 추방한 사회로 되돌아왔던 것이다.\\n\\u3000바로 그런 오만방자함(멋대로 함)이 그토록 오랫동안 그를 이 사회의 골칫(두통)거리로 내몬 결정적 원인이었던 것이다.\\n\\u3000여기(영국 땅)에서 곧 고발당한 그(=59세=매그위치=죄수)는 잠시 사 법경관들을 피하는 데 성공했으나 결국 국외(독일 항구도시)로 밀항을 시도하다 사로잡혔는데 바로 그 과정에서도 사법경관들에게 저항을 계 속했던 것이다. 게다가 그는 자신을 고발한 자의 죽음을 유발했으며 고인이 된 그 자(= 63세 = 이름이 ‘콤피슨’ = 옥스퍼드 대학 출신의 철저한 사기꾼)는 이 자(=59세=매그위치=죄수)의 살아온 이력에 대해 누구보다 자세히 알고 있던  자였다.\\n\\u3000물론 자신의 고발인에 대한 그의 행위가 의도된 것이었는지 아님 뻔 뻔스러운 자기 자신의 대담함의 결과였는지는 본인(=59세=매그위치= 죄수)이 더 잘 알  것이다.\\n\\u3000자신을 영구 추방한 땅(영국)으로 돌아온 것에 대한 법률상의 처벌이 사형이므로 그리고 그의 범행은 가중처벌이 가능한 경우이므로 그는 응당 사형을 당할 준비를 해야 함이 마땅할 것이다.\\n\\u3000유리창 위로 맺혔던 화려한 빗방울들을 통과한 4월의 햇살이 법정의 커다란 창문들에 닿아 부서지며 반짝거리고 있었다.\\n\\u3000햇살은 ‘32명의 남녀죄수들’과 ‘판사’ 사이에 폭이 넓은 한 줄기 빛줄기를 만들며 그들 둘을 다 같이 이어주고 있었다. 아마도 이 광경을 보고 방청석에 앉아 있던 사람들도 죄수와 판사가 완전히 평등한 위치에서 모든 것을 알고 계시며 절대 오류가 없는 더 큰 최후의 심판 장을 향해 묵묵히 나아가고 있음을 느꼈는지도 모른다.\\n\\u3000잠시 동안 일어서서 이 방향의 빛줄기를 자신의 얼굴 위에 뚜렷한 한 점으로 받던 그 죄수가 이렇게 말했다.\\n\\u3000“재판장님, 저는 전능하신 그 분으로부터 이미 사형 선고를 받은 자입니다. 그렇지만 당신의 판결에도 복종하겠습니다(원문에서는 ‘마지못해 받아들이겠다.’라는 의미가 있는 단어를 사용하고 있습니다).”\\n그러고는 도로 자리에 앉았다. \\n\\u3000약간의 정적이 흐르고 판사가 다시 자신이 낭독해야할 나머지 판결문을  읽어 내려갔다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 32명의 남녀죄수들 모두는 공식적으로 사형을 선고 받았다.\\n\\u3000죄수들 중 몇몇은 충격으로 부축을 받으며 퇴장했고, 또 그들 중 몇 몇은 대담한 마냥 독살스러운 얼굴표정을 지어보이며 어슬렁거리듯 걸어 나갔다. 그리고 몇 명은 방청석 쪽으로 끄떡이며 인사를 해보였고, 그리고 2명 내지 3명의 죄수는 서로 악수를 나누기도 했다. 그리고 나머지 죄수들은 법정  여기저기에  흩어져  있던  향기로운  허브(향초)들 중 몇 개를 집어 허브 조각들을 씹어대며 걸어 나갔다.\\n\\u3000그(=59세=죄수=실제 이름은 ‘매그위치’이고 가짜 이름은 ‘프로비스’)는 제일 마지막에 나갔다. 의자에서 일어나는  데에도  도움을  받아야했기 때문에 자연히 느리게 움질일 수밖엔 없었다.\\n\\u3000다른 죄수들이 모두 퇴장하는 동안 그(=59세=죄수=매그위치)는 내 손을 꼭 쥐고 있었다. 그러는 동안에도 방청객들은 교회나 여타 장소들에서 나갈 때 그러하듯이 자신들의 옷매무새를 바로 잡으며 순간순 간 손가락으로 이 죄수가 어떻다느니 저 죄수가 어떻다느니하며 지목하고 있었는데, 그 대부분은 그(=59세=죄수=매그위치)와 내(=24세=런던신사=파산 일보 직전의 영국런던신사) 쪽을 지목하는 것이었다.\\n나는 진심으로 바라고  기도했다.\\n\\u3000‘제발 그가  죽게 해달라고. 형사 법원 임시 판사가 보고서를 완성 짓기 전에 그(=59세=매그위치)가 죽게  해달라고.’\\n\\u3000하지만 그가 오랫동안 살아 사형 집행을 당하리라는 큰 공포 때문에 나는 그  날 저녁 내무장관 앞으로 탄원서를 한 장 쓰기 시작했다. 내가 어떻게 해서 그를 알게 되었는지부터 시작해 그가 어떤 연유로 인해 나를 위해 돌아오게 되었는지 기술했다.\\n\\u3000나는 그 탄원서를 내가 할 수 있는 한 가장 강렬하고도 애절하게 기술했다.\\n\\u3000글을 끝마치고 탄원서 제출을 마무리 지었을 때, 나는 가장 자비로울 것으로 예상되는 관계 당국자들 앞으로도 상당히 긴 내용의 탄원서를 자세히 작성했으며 그리고 국왕 폐하 앞으로도 탄원서를 한 장 작성했다.\\n\\u3000그(59세, 매그위치)가 선고를 받은 후 몇 날 며칠을 나는 내 의자에 쓰러져 깜빡 잠이 든 것을 제외하곤 전혀 쉬지 못했다. 오로지 탄원서 제출을 통한 호소에만 열중해 있었다.\\n\\u3000그리고 그것들을 제출한 이후에도 나는 탄원서를 제출한 장소들 벗어날 수 없었는데 내가 탄원서와 가까이에 있으면 있을수록 그 탄원서들이 좀 더 희망적이 되고 좀 덜 절망적이 되지 않을까 하는 기대 때문이었다.\\n\\u3000이러한 비이성적이고 차분하지 못한 심적 고통들로 인해 나는 내가 탄원서를 놓고 나왔던 관공서들과 고관대작들의 집들 주변을 이리저리 헤매며 돌아다녔고 저녁이면 런던의 거리들을 어슬렁어슬렁 배회하곤했다.\\n\\u3000쌀쌀하고 먼지 많은 봄이 돌아와 밤이 되고나면 그때나 지금이나 가로등이 길게 늘어서 있고 괴로운 듯 닫혀 있는 대저택들이 즐비하게 늘어서 있는 이 진저리나는 런던서부지역의 거리들이 이때의 기억들을 연상시켜 나를 울적하게  만든다.\\n\\u3000내가 그(=59세=죄수=매그위치)를 만날 수 있는 평일의 면회시간이 이제 짧아졌다. 사형 선고 이후 그는 보다 엄격히 관리되었다.\\n\\u3000내가 알아맞힌 건지 아님 내 상상이었는지 모르겠지만, 그에게 독약    을 건네줄 수도 있는 인물로 내가 의심을 받는 듯 했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 나는 그의 베갯머리(침대의 머리 부분)에 앉기 전이면 “몸수 색을 해”달라고 부탁드렸고 그리고 항상 지키고 있던 그 경관에게 “제 의도의 진정성을 확인시켜드리는 일이라면 무엇이든 해 보일 의향이 있습니다.”라고 덧붙였다.\\n\\u3000하지만\\t아무도\\t그(=59세=죄수=매그위치)나\\t나에게\\t매섭게\\t대하진 않았다.\\n행해져야 할 본분(의무)이  있고  처리되었지만  엄하진  않았다. “어제보다  더  나빠졌어요.”라며  그의  건강상태에  대해  경관은 매일\\n전해주었고, “병실에 있는 다른 아픈 죄수들”과 “간호사 일을 하며 병 시중(돌봄)을 돕던 다른 몇몇 죄수들” 또한 매번 같은 이야기를 내게 전해주었다.\\n\\u3000그들은 죄수들이었지만 인정을 버릴 만큼 악인은 아니었던 것이다. 고마워라!\\n\\u3000날짜가 지나가면서, 그(=59세=매그위치=프로비스=죄수)가 흰(하얀색) 천장을 평온하게 바라보며 누워 있곤 하다는 것을 내가 점점 더 주목하게 되었다.\\n\\u3000내가 몇 마디 말을 건네는 잠깐 동안은 그의 얼굴에도 빛이 돌았지만 그런 다음에는 이내 가라앉았으며 얼굴에 활기가 없었다.\\n\\u3000때때로  그는 말을  거의, 아니 완전히 할 수 없는  상태가 되었고 그럴 때면 그는 내 손을 가볍게 누르는 것으로 대답을 대신했다. 이제 나는 그의 의미(손을 누르는 것)를 점점 더 잘 이해하게 되었다.\\n\\u3000판결 후 날짜 수가 10을 짚었을 때였다. 그때 나는 내가 지금까지 보았던 것보다 훨씬 더 큰 변화를 그에게서 목격했다.\\n\\u3000그의 두 눈은 문 쪽을 향해 돌아가 있었고 내가 들어서자 다시 밝아졌다.\\n\\u3000“얘야,” 내가 그의 침대 옆에 앉았을 때 그가 말했다. “좀 늦는다고 생각했단다. 하지만 네가 그럴 리가 없다는 것도 잘 알았단다.”\\n\\u3000“정시에 온 거예요, 아저씨.”라며 내가 말했다. “병원에 들어오기 전엔  정문에서 기다려야했었거든요.”\\n“그럼 넌 항상 정문에서 기다리고 있는 거냐? 그러니 얘야.” \\n“예. 한 순간의 시간도 낭비하지 않기 위해서예요.”\\n\\u3000“고맙구나, 얘야, 고맙구나. 네게 신의 은총이 깃들길! 넌 절대 나를 버리지  않는구나, 얘야.”\\n\\u3000나는 말없이 그의 손을 눌렀다. 왜냐하면 나도 한 때 그를 버리려  했음을 지울 수 없었기 때문이었다.\\n\\u3000“게다가 가장 기쁜 것은,”라며 그가 말했다. “내가 어두운 구름 아래로 들어선 이래로 네가 나를 더  편안하게 여긴 다는 것이란다. 내 인생에 햇살이 비췄을 때보다 더 말이다. 나는 그게 가장 기쁘단다.”\\n\\u3000그는 바닥에 누워 몹시 힘겨워 하며 숨을 내쉬고 있었다. 애를 쓰면 쓸수록 그리고 이전처럼 나를 사랑하고 있었음에도 불구하고 그의 얼굴에서 빛은 이따금씩 사라져갔고, 엷은 막(안개) 같은 것이 하얀 천장을 바라보고 있는 그의 만족한 듯 한 얼굴에 나타나고 있었다.\\n“오늘은 많이 힘드세요,  아저씨?”\\n“난 어떤 것도 원망하지 않는단다, 얘야.”\\n\\u3000“아저씬 늘 어떤 것도 원망하지 않으셨어요.”(당신은 결코 불평하지 않아요.)\\n그는 이미 임종의(마지막) 말을 한 거였다.\\n\\u3000그가 미소를 지어 보였다. 난 그의 손이 내 손을  누르는 것을 보고  그가 내 손을 들어 자신의 가슴 위에 올려놓고 싶어 한다는 사실을 깨 달았다.\\n\\u3000내가 그의 가슴 위에 손을 얹자 그가 다시 미소를 지어보였다. 그리     곤 자신의 두 손을 내 손 위에 얹어 놓았다.\\n우리가 이러는 동안에도 면회 시간은 다 되어가고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그래서 뒤를 돌아보던 나는 내 가까이에 ‘교도소의 간수장(우두머 리)’이 서 있는 것을 발견했다.\\n그가 조용히 내게  속삭였다.\\n“자넨 여기 더 있어도  되네.”라고.\\n나는 그에게 진심으로 고마웠다. 그래서 물어보았다.\\n\\u3000“그가 제 목소리를 들을  수 있다면, 제가 그에게  몇 마디  말을 전해  도 될까요?”\\n\\u3000그 간수장(교도소의 간수장=우두머리)은 옆으로 비켜서며 ‘물러나 있 게’라고 경관에서 손짓을  해보였다.\\n\\u3000비록 조용히 진행된 변화(사람들의 움직임)들이였지만 하얀 천장을 바라보고 있던 그의 만족한 듯한 얼굴에서 엷은 안개가 걷히었다(그가 잠깐  정신을 차렸다).\\n그런 후 그는 가장 애정이 깃든 얼굴로 나를 쳐다보았다.\\n\\u3000“매그위치  씨,  전 당신께  꼭 말씀드려야 할  게  있어요. 지금 꼭요.  제  말 들리세요?”\\n내 손 위로 부드러운 압박이 느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000“아저씨에게 한 때 여자아이(딸)가 있었다고 말씀하셨죠, 사랑했지만 잃었다는 아이요.”\\n내 손 위로 좀 더 강한 압박이 느껴졌다.\\n\\u3000“그녀는 살아남았어요, 그리고 유력한 후원자들(부자인 ‘미스 해비 샴’과 ‘재거스’ 변호사)을 만났고요. 그녀는 지금 살아  있답니다.  그녀는 이제 숙녀가 되어… 너무도 아름다운 아가씨가 되어 있어요. 그리고 전 그녀를 사랑하고 있어요!”\\n\\u3000마지막 희미한 노력과 함께…, 그 노력은 내가 응해 도와주지 않았다면 전혀 할 수 없었을 마지막 희미한 노력과 함께 그는 내 손을 자신의  입술로 가져갔다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 그는, 두 손으로  내 손을 포개며 서서히 내 손을  자신의  가슴 위로 도로  내려놓았다.\\n\\u3000하얀 천장을 바라보던 그의 얼굴에 잠시 평온함이 다시 나타나는듯 했으나 이내 곧  사라졌다.\\n그의 고개가 가슴 위쪽으로 조용히 숙여졌다.\\n\\u3000그 다음에, 우리가 함께 읽어 왔었던 내용들을 염두에 두고서, 나는 기도를 드리려 ‘템플 교회’(런던의 ‘템플 교회’.  템플은  주인공의 숙소가 있는 동네) 안으로 들어갔던 두 사람을 생각해 냈다.\\n\\u3000그의 침대 곁에 앉아 있는 내가 그를 위해 해줄 수 있는 말들 중 이보다 더 좋은 말은 생각나지 않았다.\\n“오 하느님, 죄인인 그에게 자비를 베풀어주소서!”\\n\\n \\n \\n 위대한 유산\\n 57장\\n \\n \\n\\u3000이젠 온전히 나 자신만 남게 되었으므로, 나는 임차(=전세=집 빌림) 기간이 법적으로 종료되는 대로  ‘템플’(주인공의  숙소가  있는 동네이 름. 템스 강 바로 앞에 있음)에 있는 집을 빼겠다는 내 의향을 집주인에게 통보했고 계약 기간 만료시점까지는 집을 싼  값으로 임대(세를 줌)할  거라고 밝혔다.\\n\\u3000동시에 나는 집 창문들 마다 광고 전단지(집 세줌)를 내붙였다. 왜냐하면 빚에 찌들려 있었기 때문에 금전적인 수입이 어떤 식으로든 절실했기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000이쯤 나는 내 경제적 상황(막대한 빚과 계속해서 늘고 있는 이자)에 대해 심각하게 우려하기 시작했던 것이다.\\n\\u3000만약 내가 아주 심각한 질병에 빠져들고 있다는 사실 이외에 어떤 다른 진실을 파악할 수 있는 보다 분명한 이해를 끌어낼 수 있을 만큼의 에너지와 집중이 있었더라면 나는 내가 심각한 경제적 상황에 처해 있음에 깜짝 놀랐어야 했었다고 적는 편이 더 옳을 것이다.\\n\\u3000요전에 나에게 가해졌던 스트레스(매그위치의 밀항)는 병의 발병을 지연시킬 수 있었을 뿐 병을 제거해준 것은 아니었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그것이 지금 나를 엄습하고 있음을 알았다. 그리고 그 생각 외에는 어떤 다른 생각도 들지 않았다. 심지어 내가 이때 당시  내 병에  대해 관심을 두었는지조차 의문이다.\\n\\u3000하루 동안이었든가 아님 이틀 동안이었든가를 나는  소파에  누워서 또는 바닥에 누워 아님 맥없이 주저앉는 대로 집 안 어디든 누워 있었다. 머리는 그 어느 때보다 무거웠고 팔 다리는 고통스럽게 쑤셔왔기 때문에 무엇을 할 의향도 무엇을 해야겠다는 의지도 내겐 전혀 없었다.\\n\\u3000그런 다음 불안과 공포로 가득하고 아주 길게만 느껴지는 밤이 찾아 왔고, 아침이 되었을 때 지난밤에 있었던 불안과 공포에 대해 생각해 보려고 내 침대에서 자세를 바로 앉아 보려고 해보았을 때 나는 내가  그럴 수 없다는 것을 발견했다.\\n\\u3000내가 정말 칠흑 같은 밤중에 ‘가든 코트’(‘상점가’라는 뜻임 / 주인공의 숙소는 템스 강가에 있는 ‘가든 코트’ 내에 있음)로 내려가 거기에 보트가 있을 거라 생각하고 주변을 헤매며 보트를 찾았었는지,\\n\\u3000내가 어떻게 해서 침대에서 나올 수 있었는지를 몰라 극도의 두려움에 사로잡힌 상태로 계단(=주인공의 숙소 건물 내부 계단=난간이 있는 계단)에서 두 번인가 세 번인가 의식을 차렸었는지 아닌지,\\n\\u3000그(=59세=매그위치=죄수=이미 고인이 된 인물)가 계단을 올라오고 있다는 생각과 바람이 불어 등불들이 꺼졌다는 생각에 사로잡혀 꺼진 램프에 불을 붙이려고 바동대고 있는 내 자신을 내가 발견했었는지,\\n\\u3000누군가 미친 듯 지껄이는 소리와 웃음소리 그리고 괴로운 듯 신음하고 있는 소리들에 이루 다 표현하기 어려울 정도로까지 내가 시달렸었는지 와 그러한 소리들이 모두 내 자신이 내고 있는 소리들은 아닌가하고 내가 반쯤은 의심해보았었는지 아닌지,\\n\\u3000방 어두운 한쪽 구석에 문이 닫힌 화덕(대장간의 ‘화덕’)이 놓여 있고 어떤 목소리가 ‘저 안에서 미스 해비샴이 타들어가고 있다’라고 반복하고 또 반복해서 외쳐대고  있었는지를,\\n\\u3000이러한 것들이 내가 그 날 아침 침대에 누워서 더듬어보고 정리해보려던 것들이었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 ‘석회 굽는 가마’(악당 ‘올릭’이 주인공을 끈에 묶고 죽이려고했던 ‘석회 굽는 가마’)에서 뿜어져 나오는 수증기들이 나와 화덕 사이에 끼어들면서 그 모든 것들이 뒤죽박죽되어버렸다.\\n\\u3000비로소 두 사람이 나를 쳐다보며 서 있다는 사실을 알게 된 것이 바로 그 수증기를  통해서였다.\\n\\u3000(주인공의 대사→) “어떻게 오셨죠?” 내(24세, 파산직전의 영국신사) 가 깜짝 놀라며 물었다. “전 당신들을 모르는데요.”\\n\\u3000“네, 선생님.”라며 그들 중 한 남성이 허리를 아래로 굽혀 내 어깨에 가볍게 손을 대며 대답했다. “당신께서 정리하시게 될 사안이지만, 감히 말씀드리건대 당신을  체포해야겠습니다.”\\n(주인공의 대사→) “빚  때문인가요?”\\n\\u3000“모두 합쳐 ‘6천 1백 8십 1만 2천원’입니다. 선생님 성함으로 보석  상의 외상 계정에 적힌 수치만 그렀습니다.”(부연설명 : 원문에 나오는 ‘123파운드 15실링 6펜스’를 2015년 우리나라 물가기준으로 계산한 금액입니다. 꼼수 계산이지만 19세기 후반 영국 돈을 이렇게 계산하면 소설을 읽기에 나름 아주 편합니다. 반드시 틀린 계산이라고 말할 수  도 없는 그럴싸한 계산법입니다. 보다 정확하게 약식 계산하자면 ‘5천 30십 1만 2천원’이 보다 정확한 계산 결과입니다. 그냥 퉁 쳐서 6천원 만원으로  계산해 해석했습니다.)\\n(주인공의 대사→) “제가 어떻게 하면 되죠?”\\n\\u3000“먼저 저희 기관으로 가시는 것이 좋겠습니다.”라며 다른 남성이 말했다. “저흰 꽤 괜찮은 하우스(경찰서)를 관리하고 있거든요.”`\\n일어나 옷을 입어보려는 몇 번의 시도가 있었다.\\n\\u3000내(24세, 주인공=파산한 영국신사=몸 상태가 엉망진창이 된 주인공) 가 그 다음으로 그들(=두 남성=형사???)에게 주의를 기울었을 때, 그들은 침대에서 약간 떨어져 ‘선 자세’로 나를 쳐다보고만 있었다. 내가 여전히 침대에 누워 있었던  것이다.\\n\\u3000“제 몸 상태를 보셨겠지만,”라며 내가 말했다. “갈 수만 있으면 어떻게든 움직여보겠는데, 정말로 움직일 수가 없습니다. 만약 저를 여기서 다른 곳으로 옮기시면 가는 도중에 죽을 것만 같습니다.”\\n\\u3000아마도 그들은 뭐라고 대답을 했을 것이다. 그리고 찬성이든 반대든 의견을 표명했을 것이다. 아니면 나를 격려해가며 내가 생각했던 것보다 내가 더 잘 움직일 수 있다고 믿게 하려고 시도해보았을 것이다.\\n\\u3000그들이 내 기억 속에 이런 가느다란 실 한 개에 의해서만 매달려 있기 때문에, 나는 그들이 실제 어떻게 행동했는지 모르며 단지 그들이 나를 움직이게 하려는 것을 그만두었다는 것외에는 아는 것이 없다.\\n\\u3000열병에  걸렸고 사람들이 나를 피했다는 것, 그리고  내가 몹시  고생을 했다는 것, 그리고 내가 종종 정신을 잃었다는 것,\\n\\u3000그리고 지루하고 끝없이 느껴지는 시간이 흘렀다는 것, 그리고 내가 있을 수 없는 존재들과 내 자신을 혼동했다는 것,\\n\\u3000그리고 내가 집 담벼락에 박혀 있는 하나의 벽돌이었음에도 불구하고 벽돌공에 의해 끼어 맞추어진 그 현기증 나는 높은 장소에서 ‘제발 나를 꺼내 달라!’고 애타게 애원하고 있었다는 것,\\n\\u3000그리고 내가 소용돌이 위에서 부딪히고 빙빙 돌고 있는 거대한 엔진에 박힌 강철 ‘레버’(앞으로 밀거나 뒤로 당기는 조절 장치. 막대 사탕같은 거)였음에도 불구하고 내 자신의 인간의 몸은 ‘엔진을 당장 멈추고 쇠망치질을 해서라도 나를 여기서 떼어 달라!’고 애걸복걸하고 있었다는 것,\\n\\u3000그리고 내가 이러한 중병의 단계들을 거쳤다는 것을 나는 회상(되돌 아봄)을 통해 간접적으로 알고 있으며 그리고 그때 당시에도 얼마간은 알고 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 이따금씩 실제로 존재하는 사람들을 살인자들이라고 여기고 그들과 진짜로 싸워댔으며, 그러다 갑자기 그들이 내게 잘해주려는 의도인 것을 이해하고서 녹초가 된 몸 상태로 그들의 팔에 안기며 침대에 눕혀지는 경험을 하곤 했다는 사실을 나는 그때도 잘 알았다.\\n\\u3000하지만 무엇보다도, 나는 이러한 모든 사람들 속에 일정한 하나의 경향(변화 모습)이 있음을 알았고, 내가 몹시 아팠을 때 그들은 모든 종류의 인간의 얼굴을 하며 터무니없이 이상한 모습들을 보이거나 몸집이 아주 크게 팽창하기도 했는데…, 요컨대, 무엇보다도, 나는 이러한 모든 사람들 속에 놀라운 하나의 경향이 있음을 즉 그들이 조(58세. 24세인 주인공의 매형. 주인공의 친누나는 주인공과 20살 이상 차이남. 친누나는 악당 올릭에 의해 머리를 가격당해 병을 앓다 죽었음.  조는 주인공의 매형임)와 아주 닮은 사람으로 머지않아 틀을 잡아가더라는  것을 알았다.\\n\\u3000병세의 최악의 고비를 넘긴 이후, 나(24세, 파산한 주인공. 현재 주인공이 지고 있는

죽었음)의 얼굴 생김새로 틀을 잡아갔다.\\n\\u3000나는 밤중에 눈을 떴고 침대 베갯머리 곁에 있는 커다란 의자에 앉아 있는 조(매형)를  보았다.\\n\\u3000나는 낮에도 눈을 떴는데 그러면 어김없이 창(창가) 밑에 장치된 의자에 앉아 그늘진 채 열려 있는 창문에서 파이프(담○ 파이프)를 피우고 있는 조(매형)를  보았다.\\n\\u3000내가 시원한 청량음료(콜라? 사이다???)를 찾았을 때 내게 음료수를 건넨 것도 조(매형)의 큼지막하고 애정 깃든 손이었다.\\n\\u3000음료수를 마신 후 내가 다시 베개에 등을 기대며 누웠을 때 내 병세가 호전된 것을 기뻐하며 나를 부드럽게 내려다보아주는 것도 역시 조의 얼굴이었다.\\n\\u3000어느 날, 마침내 내(24세, 주인공)가 원기를 회복해 조(58세, 매형)에게 이렇게 말했다.  “조(매형이름)지(=조이죠=매형이죠.)?”\\n\\u3000내가 사랑하고 익숙한 고향의 목소리로 대답이 돌아왔다. “이제야 정신이 드는구나, 이 친구야.”(정신적으로 많이 어리숙한 ‘조’는 주인공과 어릴 적부터 반말을 주고받는 친한 친구였다가 주인공이 런던으로 상경해 신사수업을 받으면서 변해가자 주인공에게 높임말을

타고 바람 쐴 정도까지만 멀쩡해져도 정말 신이 나겠구나!”\\n\\u3000그 말을 한 후 창가로 다시 물러선 조는 등을 내가 누워 있는 침대       로 향하고 서서는 연신 눈물을 닦고 있었다.\\n\\u3000극도로 쇠약해진 내 건강상태 때문에 침대에서 일어나 그에게로 다가가려는 것이 가로막히지만 않았어도 난 달려갔을 것이다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그럴 수 없었고 나는 대신 침대에 누워 이렇게 속삭이며 참회의  눈물을 흘려야했다.\\n\\u3000“(감탄사→) 오 하느님 그를 축복해주세요! 오 하느님 저 고결하고 인정이 넘치는 자를  축복해주소서!”\\n\\u3000내가 다시 내 곁에 있는 조(=58세=매형)를  발견했을 때  그의 두  눈은 붉게 물들여있었음에도 나는 조의 손을 꼭 쥐고 있었고 우리 둘 모두 행복감을 느꼈다.(-_- 해석한 문장이 이상하네.)\\n“언제부터,  응 조?”\\n\\u3000“네 말인즉슨, 핍(24세, 파산한 주인공=런던신사), 네가 병으로 얼마나 오랫동안 누워있었냐 이거지,  친구?”\\n“응 맞아, 조(58세,  매형이름).”\\n“그게 5월 말이니까, 핍, 내일이 6월의 첫 번째 날이구나.”\\n\\u3000“여기 쭉

핍(주인공의 이름)의 평가에 의거하여.”라고 그녀가 적어놓았기 때문이지. 나도 ‘비디’(30세, 여자이름)에게서 들었지 뭐냐, 그 문구가 적혀 있었더라고 말이다.”\\n\\u3000라며 조(58세, 주인공의 매형이름)는 법정 상속권과 관련된 그 표현이 자신에게 끝없는 좋음을 가져다주는 마냥 반복하고 또 반복해서 말했다.\\n\\u3000(조의 대사임→) “‘상술한(위에서 언급한) 매튜, 그에 대한 핍(주인공의 이름)의 평가에 의거하여.’ 그리고 자그마치 20억 원이란다, 핍!”\\n\\u3000조(58세, 주인공의 매형)가 누구에게서 20억 원에 대한 그런 진부한 열기(온도)를 배웠는지 나는 결코 밝혀낼 수 없었다.\\n\\u3000하지만 그것은 그로 하여금 그 금액의 합계를 더 크게 보이게끔 만드는 것 같았고 그래서 그는 그것이 큰 금액이라고 주장할 때마다 입맛을 쩍쩍 다시는 것 같았다.\\n\\u3000조의 이러한 설명이 나에게 커다란 즐거움을 주었는데, 왜냐하면 그 것이(미스 해비샴이 매튜 포킷에게 20억 원을 유산으로 남긴 것) 내가 행했었던 유일한 선행을 완성시켰기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000“그럼, 조, 미스 해비샴의 여타 다른 친척들에게도 얼마만큼의 유산이 돌아갔는지 들어보셨어요?”라며 내가 조에게 물었다.\\n\\u3000(57장에서 이런 결과가 나오게 된 앞뒤 상황 설명 : 아래에 나오는  ‘미스 세라’, ‘미스 조지아나’, 일명 ‘낙타 부인’(=커밀러=여자이름=커밀러라는 단어는 낙타라는 영어단어와 비슷함)은 모두 미스 해비샴의 먼 친척들입니다. 하나 같이 성격이 안 좋지만 성격을

조가  계속 말했다.\\n\\u3000“낙타 부인은, 야밤에 자주 깬다니(커밀러는 자신이 미스 해비샴을 걱정해 밤에 자주 깬다며 울면서 미스 해비샴에게 느끼한 아부를 자주했음. 물론 유산을 물려받기 위해서였음) 그녀에겐, 영혼을 불어넣어줄 골풀 양초(갈대 같이 생긴 골풀을 기름에 녹여 만든 초)들을 사라며 2백만 원을 상속으로  남겼다더구나.”\\n\\u3000이런 사실 열거들의 정확함이 충분히 명백해보였기 때문에 나는 그의 정보들을 신뢰할 수  있었다.\\n\\u3000“자 어쨌든,”라며 조가 말했다. “넌 아직 튼튼하지 않지 않잖니, 친구, 그러니 오늘 일랑은 한 ‘삽’(흙을 퍼 담는 삽)만 더 담고 더 못 담을 거다. 올릭 영감(올릭은 42세임. ‘올릭 어르신’이란 표현은

피우는 인상을 풍기잖니,”라며 조가 그 사람을 언급하는 것을 미안해하는 듯 말했다. “하지만 여전히 우리 영국인들에게 있어서  집은  자신의  ‘성’(왕이  사는 성)이잖 니, 성은 전쟁 시에도 부수고 들어가는 곳이어선 안  되지.  그가  몸에 걸친 결점들(호통과 거드름)로 판별해보건대, 그는 가슴 가득 ‘곡물과 씨앗’을  파는 장수지.”\\n\\u3000(24세의 주인공의 대사→) “그럼,  강도를  당한  집이  ‘펌블추크’(72 세, 능청스러운 잡곡상인 / 주인공은 능청스런  펌불추크를 아주 싫어해서 어지간해서는 ‘씨’라는 존칭을 붙이지 않음)의 집이었다는 거야?” “바로 그렇단다, 핍(=24세=핍은 주인공 이름).”라며 조(58세의 대장 장이)가 말했다. “강도들은 카운터(안내 데스크)에 있던 돈 서랍을 가져갔고 금고까지 훔쳐갔다더구나. 게다가 그의 집에 있던 와인들을 죄다 마셔버렸고 상점에 있던 씨앗들까지 먹어치워 버렸단다. 어디 그뿐이냐, 강도들은 그의 얼굴을 철썩 때렸고 코를 세게 잡아 당겼지. 또한 그(72세의 펌블추크)를 침대기둥에 꽁꽁 묶어놓았다지 뭐냐. 그리고도 모잘라 강도들은 열 두 번이나 더 그의 얼굴을 철썩 철썩 가격했고 그 가 비명을 지르지 못하게 하려고 꽃이 피어있던 일년생 ‘풀과 나무들’ 을 그의 입에 꽉꽉 채워 넣었지. 하지만  강도들  중에 올릭(42세의 사 악한 악당)이 있는 것을 그가 알아보았던 거지. 그래서 올릭은 그 일이\\n있고 주 형무소에 갇히고 말았지.”\\n\\u3000이러한 접근 방식들을 통해 우린(24세의 주인공 + 58세의 조) 서로 자유로운 대화를 나누게  되었다.\\n\\u3000나는 기력을 회복하는 것이 더디었지만 느려도 분명 점점 덜 허약해 지고 있었다.\\n\\u3000조는 항시 나와 함께 머물렀는데 나는 이따금 내가 다시금 어린 핍   으로 돌아간 듯 한 공상(상상)에 빠져들곤했다.\\n\\u3000조(=58세=대장장이=주인공의 매형)의 부드러움이 내 요구에 너무도 훌륭하게 부합했기 때문에 나(24세, 런던신사)는 그의  손에  든  어린아이 같았다.\\n\\u3000그가 친숙한 신뢰감을 바탕으로 그리고 익숙한  ‘사람 좋음’으로 그리고 연장자답게 조심스럽게 보호해주는 태도로 그는 내게 말을 걸거나  내 옆에 앉아 있곤 했다.\\n\\u3000그래서 나는 오래 전 고향 집 부엌에서 보냈었던 시절 이후의 ‘내 전 삶’(런던 체류기간)이, 지나간 내 열병이 야기한 정신적 문제들의 하나라고 반쯤 믿곤  했다.\\n\\u3000그(조)는 나를 위해 가사도우미 일을 제외한 모든 일을 했다. 굳이 가사도우미 일을 제외시킨 이유는 그가 내 숙소에 발을 들여놓자마자  제일 먼저 내가 고용했었던 세탁부에게 급료를 주고 해고한 다음 아주 정숙한 여성을 고용했기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000“내가 확신하건데, 핍(핍은 주인공의 이름).”라며 그는 종종 자신의 처사에 대한 설명으로 다음과 같이 말하곤 했다.\\n\\u3000(조의 대사→) “내가 네게 확신해줄 수 있는 것은, 그녀가 마치 맥주 통을 다루듯 네 숙소 ‘손님용 침대’를 툭툭 쳐대며 양동이 속으로 ‘깃 털들’을 빼내고 있더라는 것이다. 내다 팔려고 말이다. 아마 내가 아니 었더라면 그 여자는 네가 누워 있는 침대까지 털어 네가 누워 있는 통  째로 깃털들을 쓸어  담아  양동이에  처넣었을  것이다.  그런  다음에도 그 여자는 ‘수프 그릇’(큰 냄비)이나 ‘야채 접시’(금속으로 만든 접시)에 석탄을 담아 점차 가져가버리고 있었고 급기야는 네 ‘웰링턴 부츠’ (무릎까지 덮는 장화. 네이버영어사전 참조)에다가도

‘덮개가 없는 마차’(이것을 ‘무개마차’라고 합니다)가 마차선(도로) 안으로 들어왔을  때, 조는 나를 자신의 두 팔로  안아 올려 마차까지 가서는 나를 마차  위에 올려놓아주었다.\\n\\u3000그건 마치 내가 아직도 어리고 희망 없는 생명체여서 그가 자신의 훌륭한 품성(인품)을 여실히 내 안에 담아주어야 되었듯이 말이다.(주인공과 주인공의 친누나 사이의 나이 차이는 20살 이상입니다. 주인공을 낳고 부모님이 모두 돌아가시자 친누나가 주인공을 키웠는데 아무도 안 데려가려는 것을 조(매형)과 같이 키우자고 해서 같이 키우게 되었습니다, 주인공을요.)\\n\\u3000그리고 조(58세, 대장장이)가 내 옆 자리에 올랐고, 우린 런던 외곽의 시골로 함께 드라이브를 나갔다. 그곳은 나무와 잔디들 위로 벌써 풍성한 여름을 만끽하고 있었고 공기 중에는 달콤한 여름의 향내가 가득  차 있었다.\\n\\u3000공교롭게도 그날은 일요일이었는데, 가련한 내가 열병을  앓아누워  침대 위를 뒹굴고 있는 동안 낮으로나 밤으로나 빛나는 태양과 어둠 속 별 빛들 아래에서 자연이 어떻게 성장하며 변화해 왔었는지 그리고 이 작은 야생의 꽃들이 어떻게 꽃을 피워왔었는지 그리고 새들의 지저 김들이 어떻게 나날이 힘을 얻어왔었는지를 생각하며 내 주변의 사랑 스러움 들에 대해 구경하고 있을 때, 내가 열병에 걸려 뒹굴었었다는 그 단순한 회상조차도 지금 내 평온을 깨는 방해물로 다가왔다.\\n\\u3000하지만 내가 다시 일요일의 종소리들을 들었을 때 그리고 넓게 펼쳐진 자연의 아름다움으로 다시 좀 더 눈을 돌렸을 때, 나는 내가 아무리 공들여 감사하다고 말해도 그건 단지 내가 아직도 열병으로 너무 허약해서 더욱더 많이 감사할 수 있는 것을 못하고 있는 것뿐이란 느낌이 들어나는 머리를 ‘조’(주인공의 매형)의 어깨 위에 기댔다.\\n\\u3000마치 오래전 언젠가 내가 그를 따라 박람회장에 갔다가 내 어린 감수성이 감내하기에는 너무도 지나친 전시물들에 놀라 내 머리를 그의  어깨  위에 기대었듯이.\\n\\u3000(주인공이 아주 어릴 적에 박람회장에 갔다가 놀란 일은 8장을 참조바람. 8장 일부 내용 발췌 → “언젠가, 나는 박람회장에 따라 갔다가 어느 무시무시한 밀랍인형을 본 적이 있었다. 그 인형이 어떤 중요한 인물을 본 딴 인형이었는지는 모르겠지만, 어떤 공적인 인물의 유해를 매장 전에 며칠간 일반인에게 공개하기 위해 만들어진

나누었다.\\n\\u3000내 옆에 있는 조는 예전 그 모습 그대로였다. 어릴 적 내 두 눈에 들어왔었던 정확히 그 모습 그대로 그는 지금도 내 두 눈에 들어와 있었다. 여전히 순박하고 성실한 사람으로서 여전히 꾸밈없고 올바른 사람으로서.\\n\\u3000우리가 다시 숙소(런던 중심)로 돌아왔을 때, 그는 마차 위에  있던  나를 들어 올려… 그는 너무도 쉽게 그 일을 해주었다!… 뜰을 가로지 르며 계단을 오르며 나를 옮겨 주었다.(주인공의 숙소는 아파트 개념입 니다. 4층 정도의 주택들이 여러 채 있고 그 가운데 안 뜰이 있으며  주택들 주위로 담이 쳐져 있으며 동서남북으로 수위실 문이 있습니다. 정문에 있는 수위실 문에서 주인공의 숙소까지 가려면 수위실을 통과해 안뜰을 지난 후 계단을 지나 숙소로 들어가 4층 건물의 4층까지 계 단을  올라가야 합니다.)\\n\\u3000그러자 그가 나를 업고 늪지대까지 갔었던 파란만장했던 크리스마스 날이 떠올랐다.(크리스마스 이브 날 감옥선을 탈옥해 주인공을 만났던 죄수(매그위치)가 군인들에게 붙잡힌 날이 크리스마스 날임. 주인공과 조는  그걸 지켜보았음)\\n\\u3000아직 우리는 변경된 내 운명(=재산상속받기 실패 후 파산)에 대해 어떠한 말도 넌지시라도 주고받지 않은 상태였다. 또한 내 최근의 이력(죄수를 해외로 탈출시키려다 붙잡히고 파산까지 당한  일)에  대해 그가 어느 정도까지 알고 있는지도 나를 모르는 상태였다.\\n\\u3000나는 이제 내 자신에 대해서는 너무도 의심하고 있었고 그에 대해서는 너무도 많이 신뢰하고 있었기 때문에 그가 그 일에 대해 물어보지 않는데 내가 먼저 그 얘기를 꺼내고 될지 어떨지를 확신하지 못하고 있었던 것이다.\\n\\u3000“들었어, 조,”(=들어봤어요, 조?) 좀  더  심사숙고를  해본  후 나(24 세, 주인공)는 그 날 그(=58세=조=대장장이)에게 물었다.\\n그는 창가에 서서 담○ 파이프를 피우고 있었다.

한 복판임^^ 물론 당시에는 런던 한 복판이 아니었겠죠)  공원에 가보기 위해 집을 나선 세 번째인가 네 번째의 외출이었다. 그때 나는 그의 안에서 일어나는 이 변화를 너무도 분명히 감지했던 것이다.\\n우리는 강을 내려다보며 화창하고 따사로운 햇살 속에 앉아 있었다. 그리고 우리가 자리에서 일어서려 할 때 나는 어쩌다가 이렇게 말하고 말았다.\\n\\u3000“이것 좀  봐, 조(58세, 매형이름)! 이젠 건강하게 걸을 수 있는 걸. 자, 내가 이젠 혼자서도 이렇게 뒤로 걸을 수 있는 걸 보게 될 거야. 자 봐봐.”\\n\\u3000“무리는 하진 말거라, 핍(24세, 주인공이름=파산한 런던신사).”라며 조가 말했다. “하지만 네가 그러는 걸 볼 수 있다면 난 기쁠 겁니다,

있었다. \\n\\u3000내 입장에서도 역시 생각이 이만저만이 아니었다. 왜냐하면 쑥쑥 자라는 조의 이러한 변화(높임말)를 어떻게 하면 가장 좋게 막을 수 있을지가 내 앞에 놓인 강력한 곤혹스러움으로 다가왔기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000물론 내가 어느 처지에 놓여있는지 그리고 내가 어디까지 내려왔는지를 그에게 정확히 밝히기가 부끄러웠음도 나는 애써 숨기지 않겠다.\\n\\u3000하지만 원컨대(생각건대) 그런 내 행동이 완전히 무가치한 꺼림도 아니었다.\\n\\u3000그가 자신의 적은 저금(돈)으로 나를 도와주길 원하리란 것을 나는 너무도 잘 알았고, 그가 나를 그런 식으로 도와서는 안 된다는 것과  그에게 그런 고통을 안겨주어서는 안 됨을 내가 잘 알았던 것이다.\\n\\u3000정말 우리 둘(주인공과 매형) 다 생각으로 가득 찬 저녁이었다. 하지만 우리가 잠자리에 들기 전에 나는 이 문제를 내일까지 기다려보기로 결정했다. 내일이, 그러니까 일요일이니까, 새로운 주(월요일~금요일)를 새로운 방식으로 시작하려던  참이었다.\\n\\u3000그래 월요일 아침이 되면 조에게 이러한 변화들(높임말)에 대해 얘기를 꺼내보자, 그래서 이 내색하지 않은 마지막 흔적을 한쪽으로 제쳐놓자, 그리고 내가 머릿속으로 무엇을 생각하고  있는지  물론  아직 말할 단계는 아닌 그 두 번째 것을 그에게 밝히고 그리고 내가 왜 ‘허 버트’(주인공의 절친)가 있는 카이로(이집트 수도) 지점으로 이주하지 않았는지도 밝히리라, 그럼 그 변화(높임말)들은 영원히 정복되리라.\\n\\u3000내 안색이 밝아짐에 따라 조(매형)의 안색도 밝아졌기 때문에 마치 그도 역시 내 생각에 공명해 어떤 결심에 다다르게 된 것 마냥 보였다.\\n\\u3000우리는  일요일을 아주 조용히 보냈다. 런던 시 외곽으로 마차를 타고 드라이브를 나갔고 들판을 좀 걸었다.\\n\\u3000(주인공의 대사→) “요즘은 아팠던 게 다행이라 느껴, 조(58세, 매형 이름).”라며  내가 말했다.\\n(조의 대사→)

되어 나(24세, 주인공=파산한 런던신사)는 침대로 갔고, 조(58세, 매형이름) 또한 내가 아픈 내내 그러했듯이 내 방까지 따라 들어와 주었다.\\n\\u3000아침(월요일 아침)때와 마찬가지로 내가 건강하다고 확실하게 느끼느냐 그가 내게  물어보았다.\\n(주인공의 대사→) “그럼 그렇고말고, 사랑하는 조.”\\n(조의 대사→) “그럼 매번 점점 더

충만했다.\\n\\u3000그래 아침 식사를 하기 전에 그에게 말을 하자, 일단은 옷부터 챙겨 입고 그가 묵고 있는 방으로 가 그를 놀래어줄 생각이었다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 그 날은 내가 아침 일찍 스스로 일어난 첫 번째 날이었기 때문이다.\\n\\u3000나는 곧 그의 침실로 갔다. 아, 그런데 그가 그곳에 없었다. 그곳에 없는 것은 그 뿐만이 아니었다. 그의 ‘여행용 트렁크’(가방) 역시 온데 간데없었다.\\n\\u3000허겁지겁 식사테이블로 가 본 나는 식사테이블 위에 종이 한 장이 놓여 있는 것을  발견했다.\\n간략하게 정리하면 다음과 같은 내용의 편지였다.\\n\\u3000〈 예의에 어긋나게 너무 오랫동안 머무는 것 같아 먼저 가마. 네가  다시 건강해졌고 이젠 조(자기 이름)의 도움

않게  “휙! 획!” 쳐다보았기  때문이다.\\n\\u3000하지만, 비디(30세, 여자이름)와 조(58세, 매형이름)에게로 되돌아가는 것이 지금은 더 즐거운 일이었다. 그들의 멋진 용서가 놋쇠 빛을한 이 철면피의 행동과 대조를 이루며 더욱 빛났기 때문이다. 만약 더  빛날 것이 있다면 말이다.\\n\\u3000나는 그들에게로 더디게 걸어가고 있었다. 내 발이 허약했기 때문이다. 하지만 내가 그들에게로 다가가면 갈수록 아픔은 덜해졌고 오만과 부정(진실 아님)로부터 더 멀리 더 멀리 벗어나고 있다는 느낌이 들었다.\\n\\u30006월의 날씨는 향기로웠다. 하늘은 푸르렀고 종달새들은 ‘덜 여문 옥 수수’(옥수수가 녹색이란 의미) 위로 높이 상승하고 있었다.\\n\\u3000시골 지역 모두가 이전에 내가 알던 것보다 훨씬 더 아름답고 평화 롭다는  생각이 들었다.\\n\\u3000내가 앞으로 이곳에서 살 삶들에 대한 수많은  유쾌한 그림들과, 내가 입증했듯 그녀(=비디=여자이름=30세)의  소박한  신앙과  맑고 편안한 지혜가 내 옆에서 안내해주는 영혼이 되어줄 때 변화해갈 내 인격에 대한 더 좋은 변화들에 대한 기대가 나를 이끌고 있었다.\\n\\u3000그러자 내 안에서 부드러운 연민의  정이 샘솟았다. 왜냐하면 내 마음은 이번 귀향으로 부드러워져 있었고, 지나와야 했던 변화가 너무나 커서 내가 마치 먼 여행길에서 맨발로 집으로 힘들게 느릿느릿 걸어가고 있는 사람, 수많은 세월을 여행으로 방랑한 사람인 마냥 느껴졌기 때문이었다.\\n\\u3000비디(30세, 여자이름)가 여자선생님으로 있는, 시골의 작은  학교는 내가  한 번도 본 적이 없는  학교였다.(←주인공이 학업을 그만두고 새로 지어진 조그마한  학교임)\\n\\u3000하지만 조용히 마을로 들어서려다보니 학교 옆 좁은 길을 지나게 되었다. 그 길은 생 울타리로 둘러쳐진 길이었다.\\n\\u3000실망했다. 학교가 쉬는 날이었기 때문이다. 아이들도 전혀 보이지

향해 걸어갔다.\\n\\u3000그 소리(해머질 소리)가 들렸어야 하는 한참 뒤에도, 그리고 내가 그 소리라고 상상했다 미처 그것이 착각이었음을 알아차린  한참  뒤에도 모든 것이 쥐죽은 듯 조용했다.\\n\\u3000라임(≒레몬^^;;) 나무들은 여전히 그 자리에 있었다. 예전 그 산사 나무도 그 자리에 있었으며,(←서양산사나무 이미지 사진 링크 네이버

않았다.\\n\\u3000대장간이 시야에 들어오자 거의 두려움이 느껴졌다. 이유를 몰랐다. 마침내 대장간을 보였고 닫혀 있음도 보였다.\\n\\u3000화염의 번쩍임도 전혀 없었다. 불똥이 비 오듯 떨어지는 반짝거림도 전혀 없었다. 고함소리도 전혀 들려오지 않았다. 그냥 문이 닫혀 있었다.  정적이 흘렀다.\\n\\u3000하지만 집은 비워있지 않았다.(대장간 옆에 주택이 붙어 있는 구조이며, 대장간과 주택 앞으로 마당이 있음) 최상의 응접실은 여전히 사용 되고 있는 듯 보였다. 왜냐하면 응접실 창가에 새하얀 커튼들이 팔랑 거리고 있었기 때문이었다. 창문은 열려진 채였고 꽃들로 화사하게 빛나고 있었다.\\n나는 조용히 다가갔다. 꽃들 너머를 들여다볼 셈이었다.\\n\\u3000그때 조(58세, 주인공의 매형)와 비디(30세, 여자이름)과 내 앞에 서 있었다. 팔짱과 팔짱을 낀채.(두둥~!!!)\\n\\u3000마치 내가 유령이 되어 나타났다는 마냥 비디(30세, 여자이름)가 처음에는 “캭”하며 소리를 한번 내질렀다. 하지만 곧 그녀는 내 품안에 있었다(포옹했다).\\n그녀를 보고 나는 울었다. 그녀도 나를 보며 울고 있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 눈물을 흘린 것은 그녀가 너무 세련되고 즐거워보였기 때문이고, 그녀가 나를 보고 운 것은 내가  너무  야위고  창백해보였기 때문이다.\\n“사랑하는 비디, 너 오늘 정말 산뜻한 옷차림이구나!” \\n“응,  사랑하는 핍(주인공이름).”\\n“그리고 조(매형이름),  정말  멋진  옷차림이야!” \\n“그래, 사랑하는 핍(주인공이름), 이 오랜 내

부엌으로 부축해 옮겼고, 나는 친근하고 익숙한 그 식탁 위에 고개를 기대고 숨을 고르고 있었다.\\n\\u3000비디는 내 한 쪽 손을 가져다 자신의 입술에 대고 있었고 조는 내 기운을 회복시키고자 내 어깨를 주무르고 있었다.\\n\\u3000(조가 비디에게 하는 대사→) “여보, 핍이 아직 건강을 충분히 회복하지 못해 경기(놀람)를 일으킨 모양이구려.”라며 조가 말했다.\\n\\u3000그리고 비디도 “제가 봐도 그런 것 같아요, 자기, 하지만 전 너무 행복한  걸요.”라며 말했다.\\n\\u3000그들 모두 나를 만난 것에 너무도 반가워하고 있었고 나를 본 것에 너무도 자랑스러워하고 있었으며 내가 그들을 찾아와 준 것에 너무도 감동받아 있었으며 마침 그 날 내가 우연히 들러 그들의 결혼식을 완벽하게 만들어준 것에 너무도 기뻐했다!\\n\\u3000내게 첫 번째로 든 가장 고마운 것 중 하나는  ‘내가 마지막으로 좌절된 이 희망(비디와의 결혼)을 입 밖에 내지 않아 조(매형이름)가 모른다는 사실이었다.’\\n\\u3000얼마나 자주, 그가 나를 간호하고 있을 때, 그것(비디에게 청혼하는 문제)이 내 입술까지  올라왔든가!\\n\\u3000그가 딱 한 시간만 더 나와 함께 있었더라도 그것(비디에게 청혼하는 문제)을 그도 인지했을 테고 그럼 얼마나 돌이킬 수 없었을까!\\n\\u3000“사랑하는 비디(여자이름),”라며 내가 말했다. “넌 온 세상에서 최고로 괜찮은 남편감을 고른 거야. 내 침대 맡에서 나를 돌보던 그를 보았더라면 아마도… 아니 아니지, 네가 지금보다 더 그를 사랑할 순 없을 테니까.”\\n“맞아, 그건 정말로 불가능해.”라며 비디가 말했다.\\n\\u3000“그리고, 사랑하는 조(매형이름), 당신은 온 세상에서  최고의 신부감을 얻은 거예요. 당신이 받아 마땅할 행복을 그녀는 가져다 줄 테니, 당신은 선하고, 인심 좋고, 고결하니까요, 조!”\\n\\u3000떨리는 입술로 조(매형이름)가 나를 바라보았다. 실제로도 그는 자신의 소매로 눈을 가리고 있었다.\\n\\u3000“그리고 오늘 두 사람이 교회를 다녀왔을 테니, 조(매형이름)와 비디 (여자이름)는 당신들이 제게 해준 모든 사랑, 제가 배은망덕함으로 보 답했었던 모든 사랑들에 대한 제 겸허한 사의(감사)를 받아주세요! 한 시간 내로 제가 여기를 떠나 해외로 나갈 예정이라 말씀드릴 때에도, 제가 교도소로 들어가지 않게 하려고

조가 소매(팔의 소매) 자락으로 자신의 얼굴을 가리며 말했다. “난 그 애에게 진실 외엔 어떤 말도 들려주지 않을 거야, 핍(주인공의  이름). 비디(=주인공의 전 여친=주인공과 사귈 뻔한  여친????)도  그러지 않을 테고. 어떤 누구도 그러지 않을 거란다.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 이제, 내가 너무도 잘 알고 있지만, 당신들이 벌써 그 마음속에서 날

합류했다.\\n\\u3000한 달이 못되어서 나는 영국을 벗어났으며, 두 달이 못되어서  나는  이미 ‘클래리커(사람이름 / 주인공이 몰래 돈을 투자해 허버트를 고용하게 한 회사이름이자 대표이름) 무역(상업)회사의 사원이었고, 그리고 일을 시작한지 채 넉 달이 못 된 날 회사 사무에 대한 전권을 이임 받았다.\\n\\u3000왜냐하면 클라라(21세, 허버트의 약혼녀)가 살고 있는 ‘제분소(방앗 간)가 있는 저수지(인공 못) 제방(둑)’(←영국 런던의 어느 동네)의 주택 거실 천정을 가로지르는 보(수평바닥하중 〈 무게 〉을 수직 기둥으로 전달시켜주는 수평구조물. 기둥이 수평으로 누운 거. -_ㅜ; 칵~ 멋진 설명. 짝짝짝)를 더 이상 ‘빌 발리’(클라라의 아버지 / 빌:이름 / 발리: 성씨. 클라라는 허버트의 약혼녀. 허버트는 주인공의 절친이자 카이로 지점장) 영감이 전율시킬 필요가 없어졌기 때문이었다. 영면에 든 것이 다(클라라의  아버지가 죽었다).\\n\\u3000그래서 클라라와 결혼하기 위해 허버트(24세, 주인공의 절친이자, 무 역회사의 카이로지점장)가 귀국해야 했고 그래서 내겐 허버트가 돌아올 때까지 카이로 지점의 업무 전반을 떠맡게 되었던 것이다.\\n\\u3000(허버트가 일하고 있는 카이로 지점은 클래리커 무역 회사의 카이로 지점이며, 주인공은 돈이 좀 있을 때 허버트를 위해 그리고 허버트를 취직시켜주는 조건으로 클래리커라는 상인과 계약을 맺고 클래리커 무역 회사가 동양에서 일을 시작할 수 있게 투자했었습니다. 계약한 사실은 주인공과 클래리커와 웨믹만 압니다. 웨믹은 변호사사무실의 서

이제 회사에서 3번째 높은 자리에까지 올랐다.\\n\\u3000그때까지 클래리커(사람이름)는 나와의 신의(주인공이 회사에 거금을 투자한 대가로 클래리커가 허버트에게 카이로 지점을 맡긴 걸 비밀로 하기)를  저버리지 않았다.\\n\\u3000하지만 내가 3번째 자리에까지 오르자, 클래리커(사람이름)는 도의심 (양심) 때문에 그동안  너무  버거웠었다며  자신이  허버트와  협력하게 된 비밀을 이젠 밝혀야겠다고  선언했다.\\n\\u3000결국 그는 자신의 말대로 했고, 대신 허버트는 당황하리만큼 깊은 감동을 받았기 때문에, 이 오랜 은폐  때문에 녀석과 내 사이가 더 나  빠진  건 없었다.\\n\\u3000나는 우리가 대기업이 되었다거나 또는 돈을 끌어 모았다거나 하는 상상을 여러분들이 하게 여지를 남기진 않겠다.\\n우린 광범위한 영역에서 사업을  하는  회사가  아니었기  때문이다. 오히려 우리는 명성을 얻었으며 우리의 이익을 얻기 위해 열심히 일한 결과 우린 매우 잘 해나갔다.\\n\\u3000이 과정에서 우리 회사가 허버트(주인공의 절친)의 한결같고 기운찬 근면과 즉응력(준비능력)에 너무도 많이 혜택을 입었기 때문에, 내가 일찍이  이  친구가  사회생활에  적절치  않다고  여길  수  있었는지 종종 의구심이  일었을 정도였다.\\n\\u3000그런 상념의 결과 어느 날, 나는 어쩌면 ‘적합지 않았음’이 그의 안에서는 전혀 없었고 오히려 내 안에 그것이 있었다는 각성을 하게 되었던 것이다.\\n\\n\\u3000(여기까지가 58장 끝입니다. 이어지는 이야기는 59장에서 계속

위해서 그 애에게 핍(주인공의 이름. 부연설명→1장 본문 중에서 발췌→ 〈 내 아버지  성 씨는 “피립”이시고 내 이름은 “필립”이다. 내 유아기(생후1세~만6세) 때 혀는 “핍”보다 더 길게나 더 확실하게 발음할 수 없었다고 하   는데 그래서 나는 나를 “핍”이라고 불렀고 그게 내 이름이 되었다. 〉 ) 이라는 이름을 지어주었단다.”\\n\\u3000내가 그 아이 옆에서 또 다른 걸상(등받이가 없는 걸상) 하나를 차지하고 앉았을 때 조가 기쁨에 겨워 말했다.\\n\\u3000물론 나는 내가 어릴 적에 펌블추크(주인공이 어릴 적에 무척 괴롭힌 노인)가 그랬던 것처럼 아이의 머리를 헝클어뜨리는 짓은 하지 않았다.\\n\\u3000조가 계속 말했다. “우린 살짝궁 저 애가 너처럼 자라길 바랐지, 아무래도 그리되고 있는 것 같지 뭐니.”\\n\\u3000나도 역시 그렇게 생각했다.(←11살짜리 꼬마아이가 무럭무럭 자라고 있다는 뜻이 아님^^ 같은 나이 또래의 아이들에 비해 키나 몸집이  엄청 작게 자라고 있다는 뜻임. 그래서 조가 주인공보고 주인공이 어릴 때처럼 자라고 있다고 한 것임)\\n\\u3000다음날 아침, 나는 그 애를 데리고 산책을 나섰다. 우린 서로를 완전하게 이해하며 수많은 대화들을 나누었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그 애를 데리고 교회 부속의 뜰(묘지)로 내려가 그 애를 거기 있던 어떤 묘석(무덤 앞 돌멩이=비석이 아님) 위에 앉혀놓았다.\\n\\u3000그러자 그 애는 그 높은 자리에서  내게 어떤  비석(사람의 이름이 적힌 비석)이 필립 피립(주인공 아버지 이름임. 이름이 ‘필립’이고 성 씨가 ‘피립’임)이 〈 이 교구(교회 행정구역)의 고인인 ‘필립 피립’ 씨 〉를 기리기 위해 놓은 비석인지 그리고 어떤 비석이 〈 그의 아내인 조지아나 부인〉을 기리기 위해 놓아둔 비석인지를 손으로 가리켜보여주었 다.(조지아나 부인=주인공의 어머니 이름)(주인공 어머니의 비석에는 “여기 조지아나 부인 역시 잠들어 계시다.”라는 문구가 적혀 있음)\\n\\u3000“비디(여자이름, 41세),” 저녁 식사를 마치고 비디(=아들1+딸1)가 자신의  어린 딸을  무릎에 눕히고 재우는 동안  대화를 나눌 때 내(35세)가 그녀에게 말했다. “조만간 ‘핍’(비디의 11살 짜리 아들)을 내게 보 내줘야 해, 아님 잠시 내게 맡겨두든가,  좌우지간  뭐  어쨌거나  말이야.”\\n\\u3000“아니, 안 되고말고,”라며 비디가 상냥하게 말했다. “넌 결혼해야 잖니.”\\n\\u3000“허버트와 클라라(부부사이)도 그렇게 말하든 걸, 하지만 나는 결혼을 안 하게 될 것 같아, 왠지 그런 생각이 들어, 비디. 더욱이 허버트의 집에 너무 단단히  정착해져선  결혼  할  생각은  꿈도  꿔지지  않는 걸. 난 이미 독신주의를 고수하는 노총각인 거야.”\\n\\u3000비디(여자이름, 41세)가 자신의 어린 딸을 내려다보더니  자그마한  손을 가져다 자신의  입술로  뽀뽀해주었다.  그런  다음  아이와  닿았던 그 선한 엄마 같은 손으로 내 손을 감쌌다.\\n\\u3000비디가 손가락에 끼고 있던 결혼반지가 누르는 가벼운 압박감과 그 행동 속에는 상대방의 마음을 움직이게 하는 무엇인가가 있었다.\\n\\u3000“사랑하는 핍(주인공의 이름, 정확히 35세),”라며 비디(여자이름, 41세)가 내게 말했다. “그녀 때문에 애태워 하지 않는 건 맞니(않는 게 맞아)?”\\n“아 아니…, 그런 건 아닌 것 같아, 비디.”\\n\\u3000“그럼 오랜 옛 친구로서 내게 말해줄래. 그녀를 완전히 잊을 수 있었니?”\\n\\u3000“사랑하는 비디, 언젠가 내 삶에서 1순위였던 것 중 어떤  것도  난  잊은 적이 없어, 그리고 그것이 아무리 사소한 것이었대도 난 잊지않아 왔어. 하지만 가려한 꿈, 아니 내가 한 때 그렇게 부르던 그 가련한 꿈들도 이젠 다 가버리고 없는 걸, 비디(여자이름)… 이젠 모두 다 지  나간 얘기들이야!”\\n\\u3000그럼에도 불구하고, 나는 알았다. 그녀(에스텔라♥)를 위해 그날 저녁 혼자서라도 그 옛 집의 집터(땅)를 다시 찾아가 볼 생각을 내가 남몰래 하고 있었음을 말이다. 그래 그렇다 해도 그건 에스텔라(♥)를 위해서였다.\\n\\u3000나는 에스텔라가 가장 행복하지 못한 삶으로 인도 되었다고 들었다. 그리고 그녀의 남편(드러믈), 그녀를 극도로 잔인하게 다루었고 오만, 허욕(탐욕), 야만 그리고 천박함의 복합체로 지독한 악명을 떨치게된 자신의 남편과도 별거 생활에 들어갔다는 소문을 나는 들은 적이 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 또한 그녀의 남편인 드러믈의 사망 소식도 들은 적이 있었다. 돌발적인 사고였다고 했다. 자신의 말(말 타는 말)을 심하게 때리다 발생한 당연한 귀결이라  들었다.\\n\\u3000그녀가  남편의  손아귀에서 벗어난 게(남편이 죽은  게) 대략 2년  전  쯤 일이었다. 아무튼 그녀는 이후 재혼을 한 것으로 나는 알고 있었다.\\n\\u3000조(사람이름)의 가족이 이른 저녁 식사를 했기 때문에 내(주인공, 35세)가 비디(여자이름, 41세)와의 대화를 서두르지 않고도  어두워지기 전에 그 옛 터(한때 미스 해비샴의 집이었던 집. 이젠 그냥 집터)를 둘러보고 올 시간이 충분히 남아 있었다.\\n\\u3000하지만, 가는 도중에 옛 ‘오브제’(물체)들을 살피기도 하고 지난날을 생각해 보기도 하며 늦장을 부리다보니, 그만 날이 완전히 저물어서야 나는 그 장소(한때 미스 해비샴의 저택이 있었던 집터)에 다다르게 되었다.\\n\\u3000이젠 저택의 흔적은 전혀 없었다. 맥주공장도 더 이상 없었다. 남아있는 건물이랄 게 전혀 없는 그냥 오래된 정원을 둘러싸고 있는 담뿐인 터(땅)였다.\\n\\u3000변변찮은 울타리가 빈 집터에 쳐져 있었다.(미스 해비샴의 저택은 담 안에 여러 주택이 있고 그 안에 맥주공장도 있고 정원도 있고 이런 저런 건물들이 담과 담으로 구역을 나워 여럿 있는 구조였음) 울타리 너 머를 바라보고 있자니, 낮고 조용한 폐허 잔해들 위로 친근한 담쟁이  덩굴 몇 점이 다시 땅에 뿌리를 박고 녹색 잎으로 자라고 있는 것이 보였다.\\n\\u3000울타리 안으로 통하는 문이 조금 열린 채 서 있었기 때문에, 나는 그 문을 밀어서 열고 안으로 들어가 보았다.\\n\\u3000차가운 은빛 안개가 ‘오후’(오전 오후 할 때의 오후)에게 면사포(결혼식 모자)를 씌우고 있었었는데, 그것을 벗겨줄 달은 아직 뜨지 않고 있는 상태였다.(멋진 표현 ^-^;; 틀린 해석이겠지만 멋져~ 굿~)\\n\\u3000하지만 별들만은 안개 저 너머에서 반짝이고 있었고, 달도 차차 떠오르고 있는 중이었다. 그래서 저녁이 마냥 어둡지 만도 않았다.\\n\\u3000예전 저택의 일부였던 건물들이 어디에 위치했었는지, 맥주공장의 자리는 어디였는지, 그리고 통로들은 어디에 위치하고 있었는지, 그리고 맥주 통들이 있던 자리는 어디인지를 나는 찾을 수 있었다.\\n\\u3000나는 그 흔적들을 모두 훑어본 후, 황량한 ‘정원 산책길’을 따라 한가롭게 천천히 나아가고 있었다. 그때 ‘정원 산책길’ 저 안에서 한 사람의 검은 실루엣 하나가 보였다.\\n\\u3000내가 앞으로 나아감에 따라, 그 실루엣(사람의 모습)도 내 존재를 의식한 것 같은 모양새를 취했다.\\n\\u3000그 실루엣(사람의 모습)은 내가 있는 방향으로  오는 길이었다. 하지만 이내 멈춰 서  있었다.\\n\\u3000내가 가까이 다가감에 따라, 나는 그것이 어떤 여인의 형상임을 알아차렸다.\\n\\u3000내가 더 가까이 다가갔기 때문에 그녀가  막  돌아서려던  참이었다. 순간 그녀가 멈췄다. 그러더니 내가 자신을 따라잡을 수 있게 해주었다. 그때, 그녀는 무척이나 놀란 듯 비틀거리며 내 이름을 읊조렸고(낮은 목소리로 말했다), 그리고 나는 비명을 지르고 말았….\\n“에스텔라(♥)!”\\n\\u3000“난 많이 변했어. 네가 날 알아본 게 의아해.”(간단한 문제지만, -_- 그렇게 간단한 문제가 아닌 게, 이 장면에서 에스텔라가 높임말을 사용하느냐 아니면 예전처럼 그냥 반말을 사용하느냐는 제게 참 골치 아픈 해결과제입니다. ‘_’ 아무래도 높임말이 우리말 해석에 더 맞는 것 같지만, 남이  읽을 때 안 좋게  생각할 것도 같아서 그냥 예전처럼 말을 낮추는 걸로 해석했습니다. 사실 에스텔라가 사용하는 영어가 높임 말인지 반말인지를 제가 모르니 답답할 것도 없지만. 소설 속에 아주 민감한  장면이라...ㅎㅎ  ^0^;;  오호~  민감  이란  단어까지  나왔군.  :) ......-_- 이 문장을 해석하기 전까진 높임말이 더 어울린다고 굳게 믿고 그렇게 해석하려고 했는데 막상 해석해놓고  보니  어째  높임말은 쫌... 쉽게 선택을 잘 못하는 성격이라 :(... 어쨌든 네이버블로그에 올 립니다.)\\n\\n\\u3000(-_- 아직도 에스텔라가 높임말을 하는지 반말을 하는지를 결정 못 했음. 일단 해석부터 계속해나가는 걸로 :( )\\n\\n생기발랄하던, 그녀의 아름다움은  정말이지  온데간데없었다. 하지만 형용할 수 없는 위엄과 형언할 수 없는 매력은 여전했다.\\n\\u3000그녀 안에 있던 그러한 매력들은 내가 전에도 익히 봐왔었던 것들이었다.\\n\\u3000내가 전에는 결코 보지 못했었던 것은, 한땐  그렇게도 도도했던 두 눈에 스린 다소 슬퍼 보이고 누그러진 빛이었다.\\n\\u3000내가 전에는 절대  느끼지 못했던 것은, 한땐  그렇게도 냉랭했던 그 두 손에 담긴 상냥한 터치(살짝 잡아줌)였다.\\n우린 가까이에 있던 벤치로 가 앉았다. 그리고  내가 말했다.\\n\\u3000(주인공의 대화→) “이렇게 많은 해(11년)가 지난 후에, 우리가 이렇게 다시 마주앉게 되다니 무척 낯설지 않니, 에스텔라(♥), 여긴 우리가 처음 만났었던 자리였잖니! 종종 여길 와보는 거니?”\\n(에스텔라의 대화→) “그때 이후론 처음이야.” (주인공의 대화→) “나도  그래.”\\n\\u3000달이 떠오르기 시작했다. 이젠 고인이 된 분(=매그위치=에스텔라의 친아버지=에스텔라는 이 사실을 모름), 새하얀 천정을 바라보던
